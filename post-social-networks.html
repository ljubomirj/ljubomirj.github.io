        <h1>Social Networks</h1>
        <p>I spend a lot of time reading (and sometimes posting) on various Social Networks. I have been on the Internet from the very start of it existing and being available. Prior to Internet, I used home made Bulletin Board Systms (BBS) and computer networks like DECnet, X.25, BITNET, etc.</p>
        <p>My understandign of how a social network like X/Twitter works is as follows.</p>
<p>
For example. I follow 5000 accounts. Each account writes about 1 post a day = 5000 posts a day. Every time I login to X and check X for new posts, the X algofeed serves me 50 posts on one screenfull. I check X 10 times per day, 10 times x 50 posts per a screenfull  = 500 posts that X will show me daily. That is 500 posts, out of the total of 5000 eligible posts that can be shown. The other 4500 eligible posts will not be shown. X must decide which 500, out of 5000 possible, to show me. Any one post has probability 0.1 to be shown. So I expect to see 1 post from 1 account once in 10 days. X algo is non-random and tilts towards factors like accounts interaction - engagement with posts {Like,Forward,Quote,Reply}, bio check, time of posting, where the timeliness is decayed by some time half-life. Chiefly seems like the most important meta-data is (a) connection (follow/s/er); and (b) timeliness, time of viewing minus time of posting (that decays quickly). The Algofeed has no idea about the meaning or truthfulness of them. Afaik the Algofeed has mostly meta-data only to go on, when deciding which post to push onto millions of user screens. Meta-data that's chiefly - Engagement (other users reactions), and Timeliness (with short half life).
</p>
<p>
Algofeed using meta-data mostly strikes me as being "judged on the color of your skin" phase of the Social Netwrok-s, and would be good to transition to "judged on the content of the character", of each and every one of the posts (and downstream - users). :-)
</p>
<p>
There's is no censorship involved - I can go to every one of those 4500 accounts home pages and read every one of those 4500 posts. There's no moderation - those 4500 posts are perfectly fine. They are not even totally suppressed - another user may have his 500 shown posts come from the 4500 not shown to me. (the algofeed will on average prefer some over the others though) The algofeed simply has to make a selection, as it's not physically possible to fit 5000 posts on my screen. As simple as.
</p>
<p>
Not having an algofeed is physically impossible. This is not only X but all social media - FB, IG, TikTok, TG, etc. This is how it works. The Algofeed is moderates every user experience every second. There is not a moment that we the users don't get it.
</p>
<p>
I heard this metaphor/abstraction by Yuval Harari recently. The algofeed deciding which 500 posts I see today out of smaller selection of 5000 (out of total of 1B possible per day) is an editor (even if automated), and X is a publisher (even if automated). The users are readers are also writers creating content without commission or pay. I don't see how X (and FB, TikTok etc) are not media companies (as opposed to - a point to point carrier of signals). They are even selling and living off adverts! :-) (mostly; X not so much nowdays)
</p>
<p>
We seem to have implicit abstraction in our heads that X/Twitter is a kind of public square, with many-to-many N-to-N, ultimately all-to-all communication. It ain't so. That N-to-N does not scale to N=100M users, it breaks down after N=10 or so.
What we have with Social media is new kind of Media. But still it's Media. All elements are here, with small differences in operation or business model, and  automation.
When an user posts something, that post is simply recorded on a computer (disk). Nothing more. Yes - it's the user that presses the post button. No - that doesn't push the post into millions of timelines. It's the algofeed that takes that post, and shoves it into millions of screens. Social media are Media, and their algorithms are their editors. The algofeed should be judged by the same criteria as the editor of any old media. X is a publisher.
Example. I follow 5000 people, each posting once a day. I check my feed 10 times a day, each time the algofeed pushes a batch of 50 posts on my screen, a total of 500 a day. It's the algofeed that selected which 500 of the 5000 eligible to push on my screen. And also decided which 4500 to ignore and not show them to me.
Good @harari_yuval at @seanilling 's "The Gray Area | Yuval Noah Harari on the AI revolution" on this -

Advbertising. In non-social one-to-many media the adverts are broadcast to all. So if there is a falsehood or slander in an advert - evetyone can see it, then provide feedback and critique. In social media (e.g. FB) one-to-one advitising is completely private. Every one use may be shown a (a) separate different advert; and (b) completely untruthful, but there is no way for anyone else to know. The advert is 1:1 between the user and the platform, completely secret. Platforms should be required to provide access to the adverts they serve to a third party. Ideally - adverts should be available for inspection by all users at all times, and in an online archive too with the historic adverts there too.

I got enrolled at some point (not sure why - I vaguely remember X offered, and I agreed) in the Community Notes programme on X. I get to vote on Community Notes others have written. And also to add notes for others to vote on - but have not done that yet.
Someone explained that the logic/istics behind is: find sufficient group of people that disagree on other issues, but agree on the note, for the note to be published. That strikes me as valuable insight. I'm surprised how well it works. Have to look up again the maths, the linear algebra of it - there was some SVD involved.
It's good, but it's wholly insufficient for a network flooded with falsehoods on an industrial scale. While the notes are being submitted and voted on, the Algofeed pushes the Post onto millions of screens. Then after a week, a Note is ready and published. From now on, it will be shown together with the original post - good. If I clicked Like or Repost, I will get a Notification that a Note appeared - good. However - millions of people that merely viewed the original post when the algofeed pushed it onto ther screen - they will never see the Note.
It's the Social Network equivalent to an old style Newspaper correction. A false story is splashed on the front page for millions to read. Then a week latter, Correction appears deep on page 23, that few read. Good that it happens - but insufficient.

As with other things, in social netwroks too: incentives -> results.
Engagement is maximized when 1/2 of users are at the throats of the other 1/2, and that's exactly the result we got. Took time but we are reaching that destination.
I want to get 1000 Feeds, incl some user defined, instead of the medieval choice of 2 - "For you" and "Following". But that's not going to happen. X went wide did Communities, some way towards conference style (current leader in that is Reddit), instead of deep improving the quality of their core product.
Another thing I want to see is RealHuman flag, and I'd pay small one off fee for that. And then to be able to filter on that flag (or not). That's not going to happen either.
TBH IDK why Musk bought Twitter only to leave it to rot. Afaics nothing is improving with my user experience.
Switch to a new platform is but impossible b/c it's a collective action problem *and* needs to happen at the same time in a short time window. Only external event can force that, c.f. Brazil ban.
Best one can do in the mean time is replicate their Social Graph, find their Follows and Followers, on alternative platforms. There will be insufficient traffic there. The "public Square N^2 iron law of network value" ensures the biggest network wins every time. Posts are like a flowing water, are quickly re-created, and most are time-events-sensitive anyway, non transplantable in content. So having your Social Graph at the ready on an alternative place is half the job done. And prudent too. It's free no reason not to reserve your favourite user nickname on Bsky or similar.
</p>
<p>Periodically there is discussion on X/Twitter if users need or want to switch to some other network. I don't think people will make the switch any time soon, unless forced to do. I have accounts on mulltiple platforms anyway.</p>
<p>
😅 I admire the commitment, but I fear, the idea "we're leaving X", is like communism. Works in theory, doesn't work in practice. 😂
Largest single public square N^2 wins every time. The iron law of social anything. 😶
It's expected and explained in (computer) networks: the number of connections ~N^2 grows with the square of the number of nodes ~N. And the value to us, users, lies in the interactions facilitated by those connections. And those connections accrue with the square of the user base. Between a larger (2N) and a smaller (N) public square, the larger one will provide as much value in a ~day as the smaller one in a ~week. Users will switch smaller->larger, increasing the difference, in a +ve feedback loop. Until approx only 1 remains standing.  Ultimately it's a winner takes all.
Switching is a very specific collective action problem. Social media natural monopoly network effect can only be circumvented by synchronization, moving *at the same time* by millions of users. The timeliness makes all the difference - must be all at the same time. So Brazil user base may switch b/c the ban forces them to move at the same time. UK user base is unlikely to switch as there is no ban.
There are no reasons to not create a Bsky account. It's easy and free - no? Just do  it. Comparing X:Bsky=100:10 millions of real users (assuming much bigger X bot ratio), ratio 10, squared makes it 100. Do I see as much interesting stuff on X in 1 day, as I see in Bsky in 3 months? Possibly. For me maybe the ratio of value is lower, but ~2 months seems realistic for me.
Personally, I find my Twitter experience positive overall. I read about negative encounters (and have mocked EM - c.f. my posts), but I rarely see ugliness on my TL. I rely on Lists - Sci-ence, Tech-nology, Comp-uting, Bio-logy, Che-mistry... - to curate my feeds beyond just "For You" and "Followers". Lists help shape the timeline, maintain focus and good SNR. Additionally, I tie individual Lists to separate Decks on XPro, effectively creating personalized thematic websites.
I find Bsky ok. The Feeds feature is much better than on X! It's not constrained to the 2 feeds ("For You" and "Followers") that X deigned to supply to us. Seems many can create different feeds, with dozen baselines provided by Bsky.  Pleasantly surprised to find deck.bsky for decks too. Transferring user listss is a chore though, finding the same people is hard. "Sky Follower Bridge" works well, but it's still weekends of manual work. Ofc, even if you find the same people, most post on X much more than on Bsky.

"Public Square N^2 iron law of network value". The network value to us N users increases with the square of N (increase), increases with with N^2, as the value is in the connections (that grow with N^2).
Current users approx (assuming lots of X bots) millions X:Bsky=100:10 users, a ratio of 10, squared that's 100. I'm both on Bsky and X. What I see on X in 1 day in terms of value takes 100 days to see the same on Bsky (~ three months?). That's approx true in my experience.
So one user switching is never going to work. Millions of users need to switch contemporaneously *at the same time*. Like Brazilians did by the force of circumstance. :-) Then the switch will work.
Bsky experience - the Feeds feature is a clear win over X. It's like having user-defined "For You" and "Following" feeds (that X lacks). Going back to short/original length posts and having to chain long post  like this one as 1/ 2/ 3/ etc parts is annoying tbh. 😄

Doubt anyone is coming after the Algofeed - but someone should. S230 I am happy to (effectively) protect me, and other humans, and also X from me. However, S230 should not protect X Algofeed, as it's not a Human, from shoving insane dross onto 100M screens daily. Engagement is maximized when 1/2 is at the throats of the other 1/2, and that's exactly the result we got. Sick of that's sh*t. Years pass there's been minimal improvement in my Algofeed experience. Only change I remember was For you and Following separation. That part of the Social network monopoly I hate. No idea how to incentivise X to give me better choice there, I want a choice of 1000s of Feeds. They are asleep at the wheel. Maybe a kick in the backside, some stick is needed to shake things a bit in that space.

I read an explainer on the state of the play, the history, the dilemmas, the legal issues, and including the most recent US court rulings that maybe relevant (or not) for the future by <a href="https://x.com/matthewstoller">@matthewstoller</a> at <a href="https://thebignewsletter.com/p/judges-rule-big-techs-free-ride-on">https://thebignewsletter.com/p/judges-rule-big-techs-free-ride-on</a>.
</p>

Thinking back at the time in the 90s the context in which S230 arose. This was time of ISPs like Prodigy, AOL, Compuserve, some of which were standalone non-Internet connected platforms to start with. As Internet as is now didn't exist! So they were kind of similar to a telephone company in that we used a telephone to access them. 😁 Like an add-on service, to my phone service. Then with Internet ISP-s started adding services - connectivity to it, Internet email, maybe small personal web pages space, etc. In that context ISP-s got protection from liability arising from carrying user-generated content, in e.g. email lists, personal web pages and similar.
It strikes me that modern Social networks now are nothing like that. 🙂 An entirely different world, almost completely unrecognizable. My ISP that is broadband provider has no relation to X. Not sure what's to be done. This is US and Law - two areas I'm no expert in.
