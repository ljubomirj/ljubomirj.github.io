If you didn't miss any in the first place, if you had no deficiency, then it will be "no difference". Consider yourself lucky.
I used to get almost immobile for few days once a year, usually in summer. An episode starting with innocuous tingling in the tigh, finny feeling in the back, then escalating quickly into back pain and back muscles going spastic. While trying various "may help" "remedies", one that possibly helped (it's impossible to tell for sure if any help at all - as the ailment goes away on its own too) noticed the ingredients were all various Vitamin B-s (1,2,12,..)
So started taking them jic, as maybe prevention, through the year. So far so good. Into the third year without the "summer back pain" episode re-occuring. Maybe a coincidence, or maybe something helped. Impossible to know for sure.
Usually when considering such intervention, I just think "what's the downside, how bad can this hurt me". (in addition to costing small amounts of money)

There was a time in UK history when someone in the UK government would see this guy, and pronto - appoint him an ambassador to Nepal, or special envoy, or some such. And make lemonade off the opportunity serendipitously presenting itself. These days, UK gov will seemingly turn stones if it needs to, to find the next Mendelson, the most undesirable unsuitable man for the job in the foreign land, and appoint the guy.

Yeah not perfect, and I grumble as anyone. But mostly for not stuffing me-my-I posts into other people-s TL-s. 😊
For reading - I used to have lists with thematic interests (checked now - still have them), curate them, and then read X that way, via the lists. But now I realise it's been ages since I last used the lists?? Actually bought Xpro first time for that! To be able to have Decks, and then List-s (and some accounts) in Deck's columns. 😁
I even notice - I prefer my "For You" TL over my "Following"?? Oh my! 😱 Given that "Following" is an aggregate of real world answers to a Q I ask myself "would I like to read a post from this Acc in the future, yes/no" when I tap "follow" on an Acc (to let X know). The revealed preference that I seem to prefer "For You" over "Following" , implies X knows me+them better than I do myself! X algo does a better job at forecasting me, than I did. 😂

Haha 😆 - your criteria are high, appreciate the feedback and chuffed to have reached the retweet level. 😁
True that applying the decay 100M times for 100M users rather than 1 once is 100M times more costly for X. But if that processing is miniscule in the grand scheme of things - then maybe affordable? And even if it's not miniscule, then discretising to 20 rather than 1 half-life, may still be significantly better for the users? While taxing X compute resources tens, but nothing millions of times more.
They may even increase engagement thus $$$? If one value of 6h was worked out from stats, and/or experiments, that maybe  was the answer to a Q "what 1 value maximises". If they allow for "what 2 values maximise $$$" or "what N values" maximise, they may even end up with higher total $$$? Maybe there is a win-win there for X and us users. An optimist copes. 😊

Haha 😂 - 6h half-life, posts halve 4 times decay factor 1/2^4 in 24h. Geddit how that works to max engage max $$$ - for financing Muskarat grand designs, earning few bob for moguls elisons, russian oligarchs and saudi princes. For the empathy workers, the RATAS turning the wheels of the emotions economy - I see how that may not be the beast for them. Wonder if half-life per user tuneable parameter would be that much more costly? Some users prefer slow(er), some fast(er), and the preference maybe. Maybe can amortise have 20 classes of uses on the 'user speed preference' axis.

Yeah - the AI-s have some advantages over HI-s.
1) Lacking ego. Given they are dis-embodied, they don't have to worry about maintaining their bodies. And b/c of that, they don't have to worry about survival.
Our monkebrain calculates ranks and hierarchies friend-foe who-whom b/c every one individual of us is completely dependent on the group for survival. Everything that keeps me alive atm was create by other people, I couldn't do it myself. Left to our own devices, we fail the 3-3-3 hours-days-weeks heat-water-food challenge and die.
2) They are transparent in a way we can never be. Their white box functioning can be frozen in time. So on one level we "understand" them completely. Every bit can be observed and analysed. It's all available, it's just a question of how much time and effort we want to devote to it.
And what do we exactly mean when we say we want to "understand" how some decision came to be. If we judge the answer should have been "2", but AI answered "1", the starting point of what happened is "NN-s added a trillion small numbers, that came to close to 1, but didn't reach 2". Often when people say "understand" they mean "write equations like F = m*a on a piece of paper, preferably not more than a page long".
In contrast, humans can't be as easily dissected. Their internal workings are not available. Even if they were, we can't freeze them in time. They change in time, but the worst part is: they change depending on our probing. That the change is conditional on our inspection makes it really really hard to audit them. Even if there were no other difficulties.

Further, downstream from that, most of our stupidity on display, will also be coming from bad morals, Bonhoeffer-style. *Not* mere - bad HW / low IQ / lacking rational faculties.

BETONIT If you really, really think that - bet on your forecast, put your money where your words are. Proportional to the strength of your belief and your risk preferences, of course.
I think otherwise. We had the most contentious election with Trump, AI could already do media with image generators, and zero deep fakes materialised. The only one I recall was Trump + Kamala walking on a beach on a sunset, expecting a baby!! 😱Don't think that many were fooled by it.
"Better content control" - haha 😂 people wish but it's not happening. IRL we've been living in the world of "The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority in the New Millennium" as described by

Not claiming any great foresights here. I simply grew up under "real socialism", so got a head start there on how a failing system/systemic failure looks like. Accountability and pursuit of truth is always demanded, asked for - and that's endearing, heart warming tbh. The current system is failing at that. "Things need to change in order to stay the same" is a good default.

Saw this KFriston interview just yesterday
https://youtube.com/watch?v=PNYWi996Beg
Must say I didn't enjoy it as much as I hoped for. I disliked the questions and the style of questioning. Thought questioning was  ridiculous. "WHY something CANT happen"?? So it's taken as given that whatever the questioner dreamt up CANT happen, fr, and now we are discussing the WHY-s?? Wtaf. The science communication version of "When did you stop beating your wife."
IDK why people think "internal states" are some mystery. Internal states can't be easier and more obvious. We've been training RNN-s, with internal state, for donkeys years. The hidden layers activations - are all internal states, but transient. Well I can put a non-transient memory, like in the RNNs-s, and hey presto, got a persistent internal state. Whether an activation pattern for "a tree" in the 20-th layer comes from filtering signals from the retina, or from my internal representation of "a tree", memorised and now recalled, and used further from that point forward - it's irrelevant to the layers 21-201.
It's as if the guys doing the interviewing are symbolics stuck in 2010. And have not internalised "symbols converted into features, into 1000-dim vectors, then those vectors interact" trick repeated over and over. (b/c it's so so useful) And are now "aww-shucks what impenetrable mystery" on everything. Or maybe it's just their trick for harvesting outrage and clicks. Maybe both.

But ask around for advice. TBF your powers are limited, and you have not got much time. If I were you, would ID 1-2 issues where it looks like I cd make a difference, and go in narrow but deep.

Baffled AAPL didn't have this already, years ago. First time I got diagnosed with elevated BP, it was obvious that a cuff device while accurate, is just so much hassle, that it's insufficient for the measurements frequency needed.
Looked around, found a Samsung watch measuring BP. Absurdly, with App certified to work only on few Samsung phones. Bought the cheapest one just for that (didn't want to change phone then). I assume that braindead behaviour is incentivised somehow by some braindead regulation.
There is monthly expiring calibration. For calibration one measures 3 times in parallel, watch on one hand, cuff on the other. Then tells the watch App what the cuff measured. I do 3 more parallel ones post calibration, this time watch reading is compared to cuff. I recalibrate if there is more than 8% difference. It's happened only couple of times in 4 years - always  justified: there was TV or some noise in the room.
Calibration does something. As the watch calibrated on me, shows absurd readings when tried on by my wife. My watch is v3, last time I checked Samsung was at v5 of the watch. Measuring frequently through the day, one becomes cognisant how variable the BP is. So measurements at the local doctors visit once a year while welcome, are wholly insufficient. Basically they are helping insofar they detect some near emergency state, very high BP maybe. But for anything else - one needs way more frequent measurements, and recording and tracking the data.

Thanks! Indeed short and useful. I now understand better. I agree with everything I heard. And think in those terms already. The example of the tree occluding the tiger is quite the coincidence! I'm probably a tiny minority to appreciate it, as I spent  3 years recognising occluded speech. 😂 Instead of tiger and a tree, I had spectrums of speech produced by humans and a noise source, and a function that mixes them. When a mixing operation is MAX, and with specific models, and in particular domain (frequency - the spectrum) one can indeed adapt the models quickly, dynamically, frame by frame. The Viterbi decoding works unchanged. And there is even a 2D version called Parallel Model Combination (PMC) used for decoding 2 (or more) sources of speech mixed - simultaneously. I've used a variant to search speech with speech. (via lattices) And the generator-classifier described is familiar, we do that in ASR. Now I understand - free energy is akin to a quadratic error of forecast versus observation. Glad I watched that, it's all totally familiar. Conditional p.d.f.s in a state space - check again, we already think in p.d.f.s too! 😆 (like so https://ljubomirj.github.io/post-knowing.html) Thanks again for the vid!

Yes - that's very true. Given we rarely spend any time away from other humans, I forget how fragile civilisation is, how easily it all falls apart. We had an announced water supply cut, and the water cut but only briefly - and got reminded.
Btw - I didn't know you lived in Ukraine. 😶 Ukrainians have done wonders, against all odds and expectations. More power to you if are there! IK words are cheap and I'm sorry I can't really say any words that will help you much. Everything that can possibly be said, has been said 10x times over, and much better that I can ever say it myself.
I think at this point only an independent nuclear deterrent by  Poland and the Nordics, but alsofor  Ukraine and the Baltics, can help stop this war and the other wars of aggression incoming from Russia. IK that trades one big risk, for many smaller risks. But honestly don't think there is anything else to stop Europe descent into another World War. A 3rd one!
One can say - 1 is a misfortune, 2 is a coincidence. But that by now should have concentrated EU and US minds. As the rest of the entire world is still at zero! While Europe is 2 up already - and 1/4 into a 3rd now. It's not 1/2 or full-on 1, only due to the bravery and industriousness of yourselves, Ukrainians.

Hey thanks. I'm aware of KFriston, I'm aware of Energy based views to information, but don't know enough. Do you have a short, high SNR source, either written, or audio or video, that I can use? I have some books - but will never read them. There aren't enough hours in the day. (thanks!)
Efficiency - had in mind that our brains need 100T connections to say learn all of Wikipedia, but LLM-s do it with 1T connections. I heard @geoffreyhinton remark on this in his excellent lectures. And IK we are born with surplus of neurons, and then the brain is sculpted by deleting a lot of them. That's finally done by the end of the extended childhood post-puberty. That analogy I had in mind.
MoE NNs also have surplus of connections than the dense NNs. So maybe say qwen3 MoE 80B weights but only A3B active, will match dense non-MoE 30B weights performance. In that sense - these weights exists, but like you say - they are not used. We trade extra 50B space used, for the same performance. But we gain:
1) At inference time - only A3B active not 30B ("multiplying by zero takes as much time as multiplying with any number; given result is known in advance, huge gain if we don't multiply with zeros, if we identify that condition beforehand"). This saves energy, and our brains run at 30W, so likely evolution to discover this trick.
2) At train time - individual experts maybe each 0.6B, will make much better use of the data they see as is target at them, be data efficient. We know our brains are very data efficient. We learn from few samples, quickly. This is again evolutionary advantage: the life form that learns faster eats the ones that have not learned yet.

True that - in theory. In practice - we are rarely at mercy of elements to that extent.
However - there is this one in practice if not in theory: will kill off the concept of a national telecom, ruling over some patch of territory. The telecoms are user hostile, connectivity i.e. Internet hostile. Even things are smoother these days for domestic customers, step out to international/roaming service, and one is back in the world of 1970-s monopolistic telecom. Internet happened only b/c TelCos cound't kill it, so in the end they joined. But their institutional instinct is always "provide less service, charge more money" towards us customers. Simply "the abundance mindset" amply found in Computers and esp Internet companies, is not there - it's in fact inverted. (only respite we got is with eSIM - by Apple not a TelCo - alternative to local sim hassle)
So X-tel will do way with that! There will be only one nation - "Earth" - as far as X-tel is concerned. All the grief with roaming, extra charges, charges and quotas per voice/sms/data/whatnot - all that grief will be deleted. Customers will get the same, seamless, good experience, wherever on planet Earth they maybe. IDK how they do it with the battery life, the power demand will be more. But it makes so much sense for it to happen. Once they have data, they have everything. The archaic illusion of voice/sms/data will disappear finally - for it's all data for real even now.

There are knife crimes in the UK, particularly tragic b/c the victims are usually young people. The public clamours for "something must me done". Politicians come back with "here is something - ergo it must be done". So they pass random "something"-s that are 1) doubtful that they address the issue 2) load a burden on the law abiding citizens. So as solutions - they are pretty dumb, usually useless.
This particular one I imagine is "something must be done" response to the tragedy of last summer. When an unhinged crazy criminal went to a dance class with young girls, and killed several small girls with a knife. (and sparked riots - for he was of foreign ancestry) Laws that made buying knives controlled and thus more difficult to buy already existed before afaik. They may have been tightened since.

Haha 😊 - it was joy and fun this @TOEwithCurt interview (curtjaimungal .substack.com/p/how-physics-absorbed-artificial-intelligence) @tegmark episode youtube .com/watch?v=-gekVfUAS7c.
Learned that Physics boundaries move? Faradey was thought a crank for his electro-magnetism, as "one can't even see the electro-magnetic waves?" (in fact "it's only thing we see" - 😂 good quip that)
Liked even his 'physicist muscle in a new area don't shy away' in a good way. They used to do that plenty in the 20-th Century. For a while looked the CompSci people maybe taking that mantle in the 21-st Century. But the Noble prize maybe shows  physicists have ideas about that.
I sure liked his 'enough with the aww-shucks what impenetrable mystery impossible for us mere mortals to tell' on consciousness. (something @CIMCAI seems to be doing too) But - let's design experiments, and measure (and yes - 'not easiest to measure, but not impossible too; physicists measure far more nuanced things all the time'), and lets start ruling out some guesses. B/c the field has descended in intolerable quackery with tons of muck floating around. As it would—given nothing can be falsified ruled out without experiments.
Listening to him saw a view of consciousness. Like the conductor in the orchestra. Like the Router in an Mixture of Experts model. Consciousness module can be thought and tested as *the router* in MoE. Experts in the MoE are the individual members of the orchestra (every one playing their own instrument). So while the router is not very big, or even a very special module, (in fact - in many ways maybe simpler then the specialised modules), it's a single point of failure. So once consciousness (in HI brain) / router (in AI MoE) fails - no expert can learn properly. Or even if the experts learns, the knowledge can not be utilised. This tallies with what's observed when consciousness malfunctions or doesn't work.
MoE-lkek architecture maybe a reason why HI is so data efficient. Sparse representations, virtue of injecting that prior knowledge in the process ("these connections for this data do not need updating"), are data efficient. That's why we like them. It's efficient to know in advance "this data is no use to Experts #1,3-5, is to be used in reach only Expert #2".
MoE-like maybe a reason why HI have too many, seemingly "surplus", neurons. Our brains are less efficient than NN-s when it comes to utilising their per-weight - why? NN-s are more efficient than us humans, when looking at efficiency in the number of weights. So maybe HI/brains trade parsimony in weights space, to gain data efficiency, and to gain speed, both reducing power consumption. All that achieved by MoE-like architecture.

IDK what's gotten into the heads of these dunder-headed academics. Enterprenurial State had a good point listing all the technologies that made our Smarthphones "smart". Developed over decades by public and private money, at ginormous cost. I thought the point was: no one can possibly predict the future. Expect 19 out of 20 ventures to fail, try hard as we may. We just down know which ones upfront. Any result of R&D spent is a lottery, exactly like companies starting up 0->1. Venture capital is a lottery too. Most fail, crash, burn and die. The 1 that survives, has to make 20x times back, to pay not only for itself, but for the 19 that failed too. I suspect combination of factors 1) no religiosity, no faith + 2) no replacement for a God-like figure all knowing all powerful. Without the latter, it's much more likely that a person starts acting delusional, as if they themselves are all knowing.

Looks to me "Freestyle Libre 2 Sensor" button-type device that one sticks in the arm, can NFC read out tap on the mobile if not outright continuously monitor, only not just glucose - but at least 20-30 other molecules, that will happen. It's surprising to me that is has not happened yet. I wore one for 2 weeks even if I'm not diabetic, curious to try and see. It's not a hassle. It's shower proof. Needle on a spring is not only pain-free, not only one doesn't need to push so ok for the squeamish - but one actually never ever sees the needle. So even the most needle-phobic maybe ok.
That my car has/engine has got more sensors more sensitive than what I got inside the body past the skin - is a scandal. It's insane that we wait for something to break down so much, as a person to be unable to function, in order for us to measure what's wrong. As opposed to continuously measuring so to catch early signs of trouble. Especially given how limited and primitive most of our interventions are. We can't even grow organs - yet we take but zero care to preserve what we got gifted. This wd be like we drive a car without a battery or tank fullness sensor. And only charge once the engine starts to splutter lacking energy or fuel. Just insane.

Heh 😬 - so you will load the cost on the widest public. So they fail to notice it that much. For the public to pay for your jolly pursuits of unicorn pink ponies. Ultimately a cost of the type: for a price X, Y die of cold, and if the price is +5% more , then Y+10 people die of cold.
IK you are innumerate so this will fly over your heads. But really those extra 10 lives lost per year, it should be charged to yourselves, and I hope personally yourselves. True you don't personally chose which 10 - only that there will be 10 more. So it's a statistical murder. But it's by commission, not omission -  as is more often usual.
I hope to live to see the day when the law is changed, so this statistical murder is still murder. And the future yous get in the dock. Who knows? With some luck, and enough public outrage at being shafted, for randoms to pursue personal flights of fancy like yours - law maybe even changed retro-actively??

Similar story here. Existing insurer quoted 850 p.a., new insurer insured for <400. They are out of control, trying it on, if it flies - it flies.
Given insurance is heavily regulated, and with 1000s of regulations in place, if UK gov wanted to catch them breaking some, they probably could. If UK gov had any instinct for self-preservation, would put some insurance CEO in the dock. (if they really really wanted to win - in jail too)
But doubt it. UK gov these days are more like a bunch of useless spineless cowardly pricks endlessly talking never doing much, and when they do do some, with no rime nor reason in stuff they do - than anything else tbh.

Hey - thanks for your thoughts. You are right there iare trade-off. As there are for most technologies.
However - I feel doomers are not accounting for the costs of delaying the technology. Given they already think in counterfactuals - well then, there is a counter factual where we discover lung cancer cure 5 years latter, than we would have otherwise. Because we decided "no neural networks training more than 10^27 flops" or some such arbitrary rule pulled out of thin air. Those 5 years worth of dead people from lung cancer - that's a very great number of people. Same for any other disease. All because of quite unspecified fears.
Afaics the only paper-clip is potentially the doomer cult. That they bring unto us, that what they fear. In the following way. Fast technological changes, of the kind we had previously in 1800+ with the industrial revolutions, do require of the society to adapt, and change all manner of things. So fast change does indeed carry a risk  of civilisational collapse. As long as society is mostly free, culture change (which is fast), should keep up with the speed of technology change.
However - many of the doomers "solutions" ("bomb the data centres!"; "detain/imprison the AI scientists") strike me as full blown authoritarian, even dictatorial. Societies authoritarian less-free have tougher time adapting to change. If change is delayed for too long, various crisis where things fail (as they don't work any more; but then change is forbidden - so they can't be changed either) build up. Only to be released all together, and in great magnitude, in a short period of time, once the dam bursts. And countries that may have otherwise adapted, if allowed to do it in their own time, now simply break down, overwhelmed by the speed and magnitude of change.
To my mind, we have existential threats 1-thermo-nuclear war, 2-meteorite hitting earth, 3-virus wiping humanity, 4-volcanic explosion causing global winter/crops failing. Afaics AI should help us decrease all 1-4 risks. So this is also something that should be put on the ledger to be weighted.
Will stop now. Thank you for your thoughts, your patience, and for reading this far. :-)

I'm sympathetic to you predicament, but "existential threat to the planet" is patiently untrue. 😬 It implies as if Earth would somehow explode or disintegrate. But the planet Earth existed in the past when there was much more CO2 in the atmosphere. When Dinosaurs roamed the Earth, and the time when average temperatures were higher, and all those giant plants actually soaked the CO2 from the atmosphere (CO2 being food for plants). That's how it got into their bodies in the first place, so for them to make our very own fossil fuels. 😆 So no - the Earth is not in danger. Not even life is in danger - as we know from similar periods when plenty life on Earth existed. Just not humans. Humans maybe in danger - but possibly maybe not. We are nothing if not very adaptable buggers. 😂 I would not worry much about this as being existential risk. We do have existential risks to worry about. Effort better spend there, afaics.

Many things are 'existential threats', I for one rate this ranked count atm: 1-thermo-nuclear war, 2-meteorite hitting earth, 3-virus wiping humanity, 4-volcanic explosion causing global winter/crops failing.
To my mind warming is a lesser risk, in ways of: if no positive feedback loop runaway warming, if it's of the kind we had so far (average of 1 degree in 80 years?) - than it's a nothing burger by impact, compared to the other risks. And if runaway from a positive feedback loop - than high impact, but then that's a way lower probability.
One thing I do know though: no 'climate physicists' (no human for that matter) can predict with absolute certainty, or even with satisfactory certainty, things that may or may not happen in the future 100 years from now.
It's doubly disappointing that otherwise intelligent people like those scientists, are taken for a ride, by self-serving grifters of all shapes and colours. Giving the scientist the equivalent of a lolly pop as award, some attention of the type "aww-shucks, are you a clever cookie, oh my" while doing nothing much for real. And in return getting the mantle of science behind themselves, to push any number of pet peeves, dear to the grifters.
The scientists themselves are doing the stupidest thing there. Turning science - noble pursuit if there ever were one! - into "scientism" in the process. And - for what?? For nothing, for  peanuts. They maybe clever, but maybe not so clever in the ways of human groups work. For monkeys are paid in peanuts...

Haha 😂 - true! touche
Once one starts reading and thinking evolutionary psychology - all those behaviours mysterious incomprehensible on their own - make so much more sense. 😁 Basically species where the above doesn't happen - they die off. Leaving too much freedom in the hands of the individuals in that respect - simply ends the species. They admire the sunset and the Pythogaras theorem and are happy and content - but have no great desire nor time to bother with reproduction.

Not saying not (I'm not a woman, and observing women around me there's plenty true in what you write) - but isn't the same true for man too? To a great extent in reality, even if man will not talk that much about that experience? (tbf they won't talk much about anything else too) I swap man-for-woman-and-v.v. in the above statement - and it still largely rings true? Maybe some details less so (emoji, melting) - but the gist is still preserved?
In a sense I find it touching that we crave connection so much. That we punish humans by depriving them from contact with other humans and that's our deterrent, the threat of isolation.
Specifically between sexes: isn't it the view of a single species split in half, and now the halves by default at 1st opportunity on fully growing up, they embark on a quest, to find their other half and re-create "the whole human" - isn't that impossibly romantic? There's virtue in independence, us being independent units and still function is valuable. But going 1→2 units in a group is the highest relative increase (100%; the next+1 is relative 2→3 is only 50% relative). Also the connection weight strength and importance of that 1 single connection is the highest that a connection will ever be.
I remember an obscure '90s book The Erect Woman (original The Planet of Women) arguing that sexuality, and in particular women's control of sexual attraction, and mating, is the key factor in human evolution. That sexual dynamics is more influential than labor, tools, opposing thumbs, brain size, fire etc. That not only does sex create every human, but that sexuality created humanity.
Possible that the author joined the ranks of the cranks since. Unfortunate - but doesn't make his then arguments nil. In fact - the argument advanced in the book makes more sense than the competing hypothesis imo. We maybe on a path to a-sexual reproduction. If that ever happens, that will have humanity bifurcate, part of humans evolve into a separate species. Such is the importance of that connection.

This strikes me the most important most consequential of all AI uses. For it to simulate agents close enough to humans, not "a dot for a spherical cow" jokes-for-models.
Then those agents can be made to rub shoulders, as if individual humans in the society. So they will have to evolve to cooperate, compete and everything in between! Would be such privilege to witness what emerges! :-)
My pet hypothesis is that feelings, and behaviours thought of "irrational" in the "Thinking Fast and Slow"-sense emerge. For all the emotions and similar irrational stuff, if not optimal for individual unit, then it must be useful or even necessary for group formation. And for group collective intelligence. Human intelligence (and stupidity) are significantly collective, not just individual.
Us humans we live in groups. From cradle to grave we are never that far away for any length of time away from other humans. Such social animals that the punishment for transgression is cutting of contact with other humans. (and especially solitary confinement as "punishment for the already punished") Also the 3-3-3 rule most of us fail and die when left to our own devices. (warmth 3h, water 3d, food 3w)
Human's group formation strikes me as most mysterious of all processes about us humans. How do we startup countries, societies? Examples we have (e.g. new states post WW2, or post WW1 European states post the age of empires) strike me as a haphazard motley collection. Hard to discover much there, the do-s and don't-s are mostly qualitative broad principles. Nothing really quantitive there that could be applied when e.g. building ex-Earth human societies.
People interested in this probably already know these. But will be put the links anyway for they deserve it.

You lose nothing much tbh. It's unlikely that your correspondent was seeking to distinguish true from false better, or reduce the error of their world model. The root of their behaviours is in their heads, it's pretty crazy in there, and even when asked to articulate or explain their actions, usually they struggle to come up with anything coherent. Now this may have been 1-in-1e9 case where the above is not the case. But we shall have to eat that chance loss now, no coming back from a block. 😂

Agreed on AI is a tool. On "not persuaded" - it's different for everyone. It's not that clear for most what would "persuade them", what's the level of test they would be accepted. Most that can't be persuaded never exactly articulate what they would accept as persuasion. And even if they did, not clear to me that it should be my job to be doing that.
Still - maybe you'll find something of interest here?
https://everythingisbullshit.blog/p/ai-doomerism-is-bullshit
Or maybe not. Most people mix an ego trip with expressing opinions (@DavidPinsof has a post on that too 😁), so any persuasion is an attack on their identity. Not something I'm that keen on.
To me, it's fairly easy as "instinctive scientist" of the "probability is the logic of science"-kind, to accept that we are wrong all the time. The game is to reduce that error. Not reach zero error - that's impossible.
When "the truth" is something yet to happen (doom, or not), it's ofc impossible to know for sure, it's in the future. I try to think in terms of "ok, atm my best guess is X, but if I see evidence Y, that will persuade me to think Z". Professionally in trading very often we did "bet X money on Y, but should the opposite of Y be happening, after I lose Z, I will cut my loss, close my bet, go home lick my wounds; but live to trade another day."
Afaics I have not seen any evidence on any doom materialising. And have seen plenty evidence for the opposite of doom, a boost materialising.

The process seems to be in full-on spam-like arms race mode: candidates spray-and-pray, HR overwhelmed by 1000s of applications. Many of bad quality, but sufficient number of good quality too. Bit even if HR just take the 1st 100 and drop the subsequent 900 into /dev/null, that's 1) still a lot to get through 2) 900 people wasting their time applying all they long, to jobs that don't effectively exist for them (despite the advert), is a colossal societal waste.

Haha - that maybe so, but doesn't disqualify the idea. After chat and code writing, I thought medicine apps will be next? Most people already upload all manner of medicinal info to their AI of choice and ask questions, explanations, opinions?

But given how constricted and super-regulated the whole field is - not the worst idea to think - what else is there as the next application? Recruitment does strike me as probable candidate.

Job hunting is stressful as default for the worker on the supply isde. (no work = no food no shelter = no life) With a recent graduate kid, I got the impression that now it's even worse than it ever was. The process seems to be in spam-like arms race mode: candidates spray-and-pray, HR overwhelmed by 1000s of applications, many of bad quality, but even if 100 out of 1000 are not spam, that's still a lot to get through. And the time waste of those 100, of which only 1 will be a good investment, is colossal. This aided by the HR, having no internal self-correcting mechanism, has deteriorated in quality while expanding in scope. So now they subtract rather than add in the process.

Yep - another indicator of a fail of the existing system. In comparison to contracting not so much clueless, but just plain lazy and seemingly stupid (in the sense of "their actions are not gain, but even small lass to themselves, but a big loss to the other side" - the recruit) recruitment agents, having decided to switch back to ML/AI from quant (with a twist of not looking for employment but C2C contracts), must say this one AI I tried https://jackandjill.ai/, is head &amp; shoulders above any human I've interacted with so far.

That is true, AI tools may add to spam, and they already do, there is a cottage industry of that "use AI to apply to 1000 jobs adverts today". But AI may solve the spam problem too. After all - AI solved the email spam afaics.
I'm not related or affiliated with J&amp;J in any way, and not have any financial interest there. Was just pleasantly surprised, and not only when it worked, but most importantly - when things we not working. How they addressed their fails.  Discovered them only last week. Just a pleasantly surprised user, not have any special knowledge what and how they do. For all I know - it maybe even some very diligent very knowledgeable human on the other side providing their super-sauce 😆 I don't think it is that, I think it's genuine automated AI. But if a tiny outfit like J&amp;J can achieve that - imagine what OAI can do

I see no reason why gpt-7-thinking-high will not do great there tbh. In a dystopian future of 2050, maybe these will be not agents hiring as one off, but everyone one of us may have personal one scouring the world for possible work connection to other humans that will a good match and potentially adding for non-trivial value. So to proactively tell the human - look there, great success and riches maybe, much better prospect that spending your time here. Like Uber and AirBnB sweat more existing assets, so these agents will make much better use of the human capital there

Reminded me - shouldn't boomers be retiring about now-ish? So maybe that's something potentially good to look forward to in near future?

...not dystopian but protopian I think that one, but 1) can't edit now 2) it show's me how black pilled we are, for "dystopian" to be pre-pended to "future" automatically without much thought 😂 damn

Compared to the median human - they are already super knowledgeable and super accurate. Then imagine comparing to half the humanity that's below that median in intellectual ability.
The current GPT-5-Thinking is an order of magnitude better. Not only providing answers. What impresses me most in the past couple of weeks using it, and also using $ codex -m gpt-5 -c model_reasoning_effort="high" to write my code - is the quality of the follow up answers?? That's improved massively.
The "Do you want me to check if you can do X via Y", "Do you want me to add Y feature next to the code" in 80% of the cases I'm "Yes please!" In the past 36h, solving problems as diverse as: make simple plain list of pics more accessible on a personal html page, fishing out a key the other side of the door through a letter box when the spare key copy proved badly cut to open it, fitting an AMD 7900xtx in a 10yrs old desktop.

I think that too. Small price to pay. They built a company worth XX $B, and paid a $1.5B price. Had they gone the totally legal route, they maybe have paid only $15M for the books and scanning, but it would have taken them such a long time, that the company chance of success would be much reduced. Likely  to have failed. So yeah - paying $1.5B at achieve XX $B, versus alternative of paying $15M to achieve $0, strikes me a path well taken.
Wider issue with the so-called "IP" property. It's a problem for US now. That Americans ideologies, while admirable in their many ways, that there is not a greater than a small minority that finds throwing people in jail for copying data intolerable. Granting monopoly powers enforced with violence by coercive state power should trigger many more people as being abominable.
I imagine 2050s Intelligence Revolution multiplies by another x10-20x times factor, the total human wealth and goodness as value. What the Industrial Revolution in 1800s previously did with mechanical machines amplifying human mechanical labour. Now AI machines amplify human intellectual labour.
Given the potential prizes, even maybe not super high probability every individual one - think zero IP restrictions are warranted in my mind. If I accept and internalise "The Bitter Lesson". That may as well be called "The Iron Law of (Data,Compute)", of compute transforming data → information → knowledge → intelligence → agency → ...AGI... → ...ASI. To my mind "remove any any and all obstacles on that path" is totally reasonable.
Often I wonder if good old viral campaign may achieve a lot there. Who doesn't like free? The 90% of the population working the land will be for it overwhelmingly. Big studio like Disney etc already pissed people enough with crappy sequels, woke stupidities, being so poor at streaming that pirated content forever provided better experience than my subscription services. The 9% running the country, mostly lemon-sucking liberal puritans will be against. But if in the 1% owning the country the idea takes hold - then who knows?
Maybe some Latin patina may prod the insurgent currently not-established elite (but in the process of becoming the new establishment) to take up this cause? They already seem into RETVRN and Roman salutes - the TBTR wing of the Trump coalition. That they go all in and delete IP in a fit of retribution against the old order. Maybe in concert with some sort of seismic shake-off of US gerontocracy. (in Congress/Senate)

They are the best models we have got, of how us humans work. No other model has managed to reproduce aspects of humans as much as they have. Strictly speaking - they are not taking the best token 100% of the time. That produces boring output. They are sampling from the conditional distribution, so often they will take the 2nd, 3rd etc most likely token.

Ok - but it's not merely about predicting language, predicting the next word, right? We've had N-gram models predicting the next word for decades, and no-one thought "that's intelligent". Is intelligence quessing correctly the killer in a crime novel, after reading through the entire novel, sans the last word? (that word being the name of the killer) To my mind - yes it is, if correct every time. It's not - if wrong every time.
Imo pattern recognition is "system 1". Usually detractors accept that current NNs achieve that. And quible about "system 2" - reasoning.
Multumodality - that's WIP as we see with models jointly modelling text, images, presumably to come audio and video.
Continuous learning - that everyone accepts they are lacking the most, can do none of that atm, see yesterday's @dwarkesh_sp and @RichardSSutton.
"A real thought proces" - one wd have to discuss what you mean by "thought", and what's "real" for you and what's not, I guess what's "a fake thought proces".
I just find it puzzling that one would say "they have to have N out of N", N-2 or N-1 don't cut it. Where you select specific N features, mostly looking at 1 individual human.
So not even considering that e.g. emotions (in the emotional intelligence) are most likely detracting, irrational, at individual level, and most likely evolved for implementing collective human intelligence, at group level. So emotions would be a feature of group intelligence imo. That will come in play too, when AI-s get to be many, and get to have to coordinate with each other.
Subconscious running specialised modules - again not something impossible for AI-s, we see that done at various levels.
This is too long to be discussing in a tweet will stop now.

Ofc one doesn't like the view. You are missing the point, like the OP: it's not the words, it's the quality of the words that makes the difference. Like in this anecdote "And the killer is ..."
Humans didn't like that the Sun, and the Cosmos didn't orbit around them, when they "ofc are at the centre of everything." Latter humans disliked that they were not made in God's image, by God almighty himself, but were just another leaf in the the tree of life. Latter after accepting we are not that apart from animals, and even share ancestors with some other monkeys - we still disliked being shown to be less rational than we thought of ourselves. 😂
The latest edition of "we are special" is that we can think, and nothing else can quite do the same. Despite observing intelligence, to some degree, in every living thing, from cells smaller than us, to societal ecosystems larger than us. B/c even our intelligence - is not individual, but collective. Should make us think twice before going "I'm special". But no - still our monkebrains whirr and whirr around, and come up with the "I'm special!" 😅
I mean - we are not totally wrong, every one of us is one and only, so true I'm special. But so was every other human that ever lived. And every living creature that ever was for that matter. So maybe not that special in the grand scheme of things. 😇

Excellent 👌 idea! 👍
Not the least - for themselves!
Yeah IK they all run tests, at multiple levels, to detect breakages, errors, degradations... But still - at end user level, it's still fiendishly difficult, to auto-user-experience-test the real user experience. B/c we are talking about degradation, not breakage.
So yeah - running continuous IQ testing using 0.01% of the GPU production cluster, maybe a price worth paying.
I bet - not only will they once in a blue moon discover a top level degrade that wd otherwise have gone unnoticed. That's saving some reputation damage, but tbf not that big a deal in the grand scheme of things. I dislike DD (=Dario-the self-serving b/s-Doomer) as the next guy, yet: I don't think less of Anthropic for the balls-up. I actually think better of them post-mortem! For having got to the bottom of a problem like "after adding trillion trillions small numbers, close to zero but not quiet zero, on 100K boxes with 1M gpus, performance reached 95% of optimal, but not the desired 100%." It's a testament to their crafts!
No - I think with devoting small capacity of their production to monitoring of huge scale like this, they will notice emergent stuff, that they wouldn't have otherwise. They are crafty buggers (as seen with the getting to the bottom of the bug) - and they will make surprisingly good use of what looks like a bog standard production boring monitor. B/c the scale of it will make the big  difference.

Government - they are just stationary bandits. A self-selected mafia conspiracy. They would murder you, and me, and our kids, in a blink of an eye, without thinking twice.
People think people in gov are "a bit bent". No - they are so beyond the pale, so gone, as to, for them, on killing 1000s of people by commission or ommisiona, the first and the last worry is - "how to not get caught, not held responsible." That's it. That's the extent to which gov feels responsible.

Heh - that kind of question is more befitting a 5yo, I'm sorry to say. I expect it's a snake pit, the party politics. We've heard of "climbing the greasy pole", but that was in the olden days of "gentlemanly conduct." (always more in words than deeds) By now I expect it's  "stab you in the back, and in the front, and in the head too for a good measure" - the party politics. Expect there will be 20 LAB-s in the top-100 brass actively working towards KS firing AR. People vying for top positions are not just small petty criminals fiddling the office expense kitty box. No - I expect them to be major psychopaths. So yes - I lot will be working 24/7 to kick out AR out of her position, as default, there is no need for "why", asking "why" is not understanding the game. The same way AR herself worked into her present position! These people levels of depravity are of the kind where killing of 1000s of people by commission or omission, is only ever a "will I get caught and lose my power my perks by having to resign" consideration. Ofc they know no one ever goes to jail, no matter what the crime. They are safe there, so (rightly) it'd not occur to them to worry about that. Us the plebs we have too rosy a picture of politicians.

My take on this is:
Short term - we should all use gpt-5-thinking more. I for the life of me couldn't understand how people in the UK are not freaking out, but dishing out millions, to leasehold properties that they don't own. And that revert to the freeholder after set number of years.  I thought I misunderstood things when reading through the leageleese in the leese. Then GPT reading with me confirmed what I suspected: after term reversion, possibility of confiscation, unlimited liability Re: costs, any dispute and one better get a 2nd profession as advocate and litigator.
Long term - all present laws need to be worked through GPT-s with the remit to simplify and delete as much as possible, while still keeping the broad outlines, the intent of the laws to the extent it's clear enough. Where unclear - then DELETE. If DPM and her band of lawyers, conveyancers can fall foul of the laws, not understanding fully etc, then with 100% certainty every one of us UK citizens is in breach of some law. That is Stalin-levels danger, when the citizens in order to live ordinary lives, are effectively criminals-in-waiting. It's a sign that the laws are awful.

Hitting a trifecta the god'ole Guardinan there. What are the chances for it to be a random chance, haha. 😂 In general, the 1st (and 2nd, and ...) impulse of most of these gatekeepers is to scare the population senseless. It's all B/S in the purest form, well documented and articulated by @DavidPinsof's magisterial series of articles on contemporary B/S  https://substack.com/@everythingisbullshit blog. These lemon sucking puritans go into overdrive at the thought, that someone, somewhere, might not be miserable 101% of the time.
The guardianista fashinista coalition, with red-green melonista soc-fash plebs, run by an elite of the most spineless craven of libs, is so pathetic by now - that one struggles to even wish them ill. Tragic stuff. It was youth ill spent to start with. By now degenerated into lifetimes wasted.

Yeah I get that, I'm vaguely familiar with the ideas proposal, incl about nano-tubules, but also further leaps of faith by e.g. Penrose. On on all that I think like Scott Aaronson (https://youtube.com/watch?v=nAMjv0NAESM&t=2176s, https://youtube.com/watch?v=ANFnUHcYza0, https://youtube.com/watch?v=XgCHZ1G93iA), what he says makes sense to my mind. Even in in the unlikely case any of those to pan out - imo all that is micro-scale. Like in photosynthesis - maybe it makes things run smoother, more efficient, but it's not fundamentally different, it's all computation. (except for Penrose - who departs few steps further, to uncomputability, maybe along this https://youtube.com/watch?v=_SpySWkHu7k)
I don't think your ideas are nonsense, don't worry. But even if they were - so what? Most of everyone's ideas turn out wrong on testing, on examination. People that achieve a lot - it's not that their hit rate is 10% as opposed to say 1% of any of us. No—their hit rate is 1% too, but they come up generate 10x more ideas than the rest of us pedestrian thinkers.

On whether quantum-anything will buy us much, I think like the differences between a bird vs. a plane. Both have wings, but a bird flaps them, a plane doesn't. There are pros- and cons- to both. A bird is much smaller lighter, doesn't need an airport, can re-produce self-create. The metal plane is lacking in all those things, but: it can ferry 100 tons of cargo in 24h to the ends of the world. Then repeat that 100 times, every day, for 100 days. It maybe those quantum effect are optimisation (like in photosynthesis) to make things work on 30W of power, and also to bootstrap on their own, from few molecules. That's all needed for analog intelligence, that is the human intelligence. In contrast, the digital intelligence that is artificial intelligence (AI) - they need 1000x times of that. So 30kW power, thousands of people working on them for years etc.

I think more like from computation PoV. The many worlds, may provide counter-factuals, things that could have plausibly happened, but didn't. So to give us extra data. That would be step 1 in addressing the curse of dimensionality. And then the step 2 to complete, would be to make use of it in some way that doesn't take too much time. So maybe something to do with quantum computation. If it is realised in some way.
More general, I would be looking how to harness laws for physics for computation.
So our physical world is magic, in a way that it runs minimisation of energy on its own. Left to its own devices, by magic, our real physical system finds its minimal energy point. That strikes me as a valuable computation that could be harnessed? This is I think @BasedBeffJezos idea.
The 2nd thing - and IDK quantum anything, very ignorant myself (the only things that ever make sense to me there is this lecture  https://scottaaronson.com/democritus/lec9.html,  @DavidDeutschOxf talks like this https://youtube.com/watch?v=bux0SjaUCY0, and Vedral quantum information book), but get the impression that basically there is a computation there that's integration, summation of some sort, and is done again in physics. So that maybe useful for us, we can maybe make it compute something for us?
I wonder if someone that knows math can tell if these two operations (minimisation argmin, integration sum) are sufficient for anything, and what's that anything. IDK myself - not unlike yourself, I'm wildly speculating. :-) It's not a biggie, as long as one accepts that 99% (for me more than 99.9%) of times, one will be wrong. Any theory is a guess to start with. Some turn out the have been lucky guesses. :-)

For me tbh I see nothing but computation. That's our latest-greatest model of the world around us afaics. I see nothing else but counting, (we need time for that) and joint probability density functions p.d.f.s, observations, slicing the p.d.f.s, their conditioning, and marginalisation. IDK what else is there tbh. That's all the computation one needs. One p.d.f. per state, and again with time it's maybe moving from state to state. (at some point I put this in html to off-load it from my mind so I move on, here https://ljubomirj.github.io/post-knowing.html) Afaics we are in a goldilocks zone. Our default is 'aleatoric uncertainty', where we can reasonably guess the p.d.f. So ok not ideal, we don't know which one outcome happens when we throw a dice - but we do know how many, of each outcome! That's not nothing. Sometime we get to know which outcomes happen as well exactly! Then we are in luck - we got a Dirac impulse for a p.d.f. At other times we are unlucky, we got to deal with 'epistemic uncertainty', where not even the p.d.f. can be reasonably guessed: we don't know all the outcomes, and we count how many. But these occasions are not many I think? For otherwise our life our world of all living things would be impossible. To stay alive, at multiple levels, we have to forecast with some level of success >0 things about our world. And for that, we can't be completely ignorant about the p.d.f.s.

Sorry for this too long a message. I should have broken it but don't have the strength to go back and re-edit now. Sorry

Time to invest in new benchmark Cos. Expect AGI to be like an orchestra. To have one conductor, coordinating the individual specialised modules. This is our brain organisation afaics to the best of our knowledge. But hey - silicon maybe different to carbon, so wdik?
Except: the same pattern is repeated one up, at societal level. It's not that individual human is the most powerful in the animal kingdom. No - any wild cat can eat us, any wild cow can trample us, every big fish or other water nastie can drown us, parcel us eat us. No - the intelligence that puts us at the top of the food chain, is our collective, group intelligence. (good portion of our stupidity is social too - @skdh got a good YT vid) That's why I suspect that ASI will be a concert orchestra of AGI-s. And for them to coordinate, (cooperate + compete) they will I imagine evolve similar "irrational" (from the PoV of the individual/AGI; but entirely rational from group/ASI PoV) features like feelings, status ranking beauty contests games etc.

It always bothered me that "Science", in the "Computer Science". We should get rid of that - just call it "Computing". As a rule of thumb - disciplines that are not sciences, append "Science" ("Social Science" etc), to bestow upon themselves the patina of science. For the scientific method has been quite good, has a good track record. So for that, for the aspiration, I don't actually begrudge these disciplines the "Science" appendix.
But Computing has actually gone past that. Computing has been useful to billions of people now, improved their lives. It's "fake it till you make it" all right, fair enough - but Computing has made it now. Don't need to pretend any more. Drop Science in "Computer Science". Just "Computing" suffices. Or "Computation"? IDK what people prefer. Physics, Chemistry, Biology - Computation? (rather than Computing)

Thanks for that. I appreciate it fr! 🙏 (one-person-army contact is precious 😊 )
On the remark by someone earlier that you have 10x more fwd passes: see if you can use 10x more neurons, to get away from the 10x passes 10x more time spent.
Human brain has 10x-100x more connections. It does do more than LLM-s in some domains (but less in others), but I do wonder - does it do **that much** more?
Maybe the brain's got some trick, where 10x more time (impossible to have) is replaced by 10x more space? (possible to have - even if costly) This is not uncommon in CompSci - to trade time and space one for another. For the brain is in competition with other brains life forms. They compete to eat each other. The 1st brain that 1) works minimally well enough to eat at all; and 2) is better than the rest - that guy eats the rest. So it's very unlikely, that the brain to be doing something as massively inefficient, as using x10 times more resource than minimally needed, for no reason at all whatsoever.
Aside. Thanks for the AMD GPU article. (can't find the url rn) You inspired me to get one or two now. I couldn't bring myself to buy Nvidia local GPU - for the price, but also for pytorch. I didn't put the 1+1 together - with AMD can use @__tinygrad__, that I already fancied to try?? Advice back for a laptop: get a 2nd had MBP (I got M2 96GB RAM - try get max 128GB if you can) for large size MoE-s inference. That works well.
I was stuck in netherland wrt local training. Yeah IK cloud training can be had even for $10 (e.g. PI) - but it's 1) more of a chore 2) adds up, but most of all 3) I like my independence of one-person-army. 😁

TBS - but maybe she can trade 10x time for 10x space. Maybe that's why we humans have 10x surplus connections?? We trade time for space? Makes sense, the trade-off: we can 10x space moderately easy (costs energy but doable), in a way we can't 10x time (impossible).

Yes, curiously - so we got Type 1 pattern recognition working aka pre-training. Took us a long time. Now with reasoning models, hypothesis generation and rollout, pruning, searching etc - we are putting together Type 2 reasoning intelligence into production.
I love this as the next guy - it's glorious! 🥰 So I decided to move back to ML/AI and away from printing $$$ in quant trading. This is so so much fun!
Onto next steps. Afaics generating novel hypothesis is another feat of goldilocks. Not 'too same' as to be a nothing burger if we solve it (so we learn nothing). Not 'too difficult' as for us to not solve it, and learn nothing again. But - just right. Quantified, looks like that amount of novelty - and I like the "skipping stones" metaphor I heard @jeffclune articulate! - is about 20% "novelty".
I was wondering what's next after "open endedness", and then I read this https://substack.com/home/post/p-155196514 by @DavidPinsof. Minor -  confirmed what I already thought about the silly doomers, and articulated more arguments and 100x times better than I ever could. But, majorly - it confirmed what I had a nagging suspicion of: our human brain is an orchestra of specialised modules, performing in a concert. That's how humans rule the world. So AGI will have specialised modules + conductor.
Further - the way we are internally, is the way we are externally too! Our intelligence, and stupidity too - are collective. The conductor, or rather the process of conductance and that includes conducting but is not limited to - will be the next step towards ASI. Afaics we are nowhere close ASI. We maybe getting closer to AGI, fleshing out the interfaces outlined above. But ASI will involve scaling up groups of AGI-s, the way human intelligence is scaled up in the collective intelligence that is our society. Consciousness being at AGI level (a level down from ASI) looks a minor thing. Major stuff is everything else ex-intelligence. Where we get to our feelings, status games we play, etc - and yes inc delusions at AGI level that give rise to reality modelling at ASI level. (not available to AGI.)
I'm loving this 😍 - sorry to repeat myself.

Yes - that was the gist. That being adapted to the environment is good. But there is a thing of being **too adapted** to the environment. As the environment is not static, the environment changes as well too! So there is a goldilocks zone there - want to be adapted, but not too much adapted.
I'm fond if this b/c I did some training on masked models. And adapting models to noise, by masking features. In another lifetime at about ~2000s. :-) Different times different considerations though: the models were tiny, computers too, so  while overfitting was a consideration, it was one of many.

In practice - in addition to my native language, I learned another language as a young child when I started reading. And a third languge few years latter mid-childhood and into teenage hood and all the way to now. (still learning) In theory and practice - I had worked on making computers learn to recognise, and create speech. I know things, I'm not ignorant. I try not to give advice lightly.

I started using em-dash, in addition to using en-dash and hyphen (of which I took no notice of the difference - but now I do), after I saw ChatGPT do it. Now I know on a Mac keyboard it's "option-dash". I'm annoyed to have to copy&paste peck from existing text for the same "—" on Linux. Where I promptly forget how to get it on the keyboard every time soon after ChatGPT tells me how.
But now a recent twist on this. Recently I noticed pathetic humans inventing a new ranked sorting for establishing status, this time - and this is hard to believe - on argmin{number of em dashes}!! That annoyed me greatly. Our monkebrain racing quickly "how do I use the latest tech to re-enact beauty contest to re-establish caveman hierarchy in newly changed circumstance? Ah - bingo! argmin{em-dash} is it!" Us humans making extra effort, going out of our way, to remain moron-grug-s! At non-zero cost. Pathetic - best ridiculed and mocked without mercy.
Well, from now on, I go out of my way, to put at least one em dash, but ideally mix all three types (em, en, hyphen) in my writing. So to tax the mental faculties of the monkebrains. Brainrot them a bit, confuse the enemy, keep him busy occupied pegged close to 100% counting for the rank sort. So they exhaust themselves, and fail to enact (maybe even give up on?) the latest stupidity. Sow confusion in the monkebrains subjects of my derision.

Sounds like a skill issue to me on part of Tesla.
Yes, I see how more data can make me uncertain. Say I'm reasonably certain that I'm free of cancer, say odds are 90:10 at my age. Low uncertainty, I'm fairly certain I've not got cancer. Now I take a cancer test - it comes back positive. For the people of my age, that tested positive, the odds of having cancer for real are 50:50. So now after this latest data point, and latest update of my p.d.f - I'm less certain than previously. In fact, I'm in a state of perfect ignorance! It's a coin flip for me now - have, or have I not, got cancer.
Two sensors instead of one are like that. Yes, they can confuse us when contradictory. No, it does not mean they always will. It's a skill issue to make two sensors work better than a single sensor. Yes, it will take more CPU power probably. But one should be able to improve the accuracy of the forecasts.

Learning new language after the end of the final brain development (post-puberty, after the teenage years) is impossible without accent for most humans. Few super-language learners exists, but are a tiny minority. It's very hard at any level for most of us. (my pet theory - the surplus neurons we are born with as babies are finally pruned; hardware is lacking for a feat like acquiring a new language well)
It's like losing weight: in theory it's 'obvious' what I am supposed to do. In practice, it's but impossible for me to learn it well enough, for long enough, to actually execute on the 'theory' in practice.
After decades of middling effort, we are on the cusp of creating at least the 1st half of the Babelfish device. We should concentrate more on that -

Sexual reproduction being one of the mysteries of evolution: why, after adapting the organism to the environment, through hard work selecting the right combination of genes, it's to evolutionary advantage to then throw 1/2 of them, at random (!!) in the bin, and replace them with the genes of some other unit??

Thanks - ok, that makes more sense. Btw is it known what came first - the German preparation for wars of conquest, or the British blockade? Are we sure the British blocade was not in response to Germany ramping up, revving up, a war machine? History not my strong side - as mentioned, never understood properly as to "why".
I get the idea of "Liebensraum" and we see how wrong and stupid it was, as shown by future events. I presume Germany today has many more people than then, and they are all well fed too. So no conquest of UKR was needed.
I recoil every time someone (usually a degrowth-er these days) trots the idiocy "can't have infinite growth on a finite planet". As I'm reminded, by the "Liebensraum" example, how much harm wrong ideas can inflict. Triply surprsiing?? - given 5-10 mins of thinking are enough to show this idea is logically unsound. What were these people 100 years ago thinking??

TBS - the industrial revolution ushered the 5 days x 8 hours work week. TBH if you are assets rich enough to get enough passive income, 3-2-1-even-0 days work week is also possible, ;-) but that's a small minority - so inconsequential.
For grand scale to the entire society: I'm forever wondering if us humans can coordinate well enough, (where coordination = cooperation + competition) for the society to function, while giving up on the coercion (and ultimately - threat of death) towards the individual? So giving total freedom from want (thirst, hunger, shelter) to the individual us, all the while still being able to maintain current or even higher level of production of goods and services.

I assume all lazy bots elonmusk12345 in existence are some kind of  'Elon bot army' and that's why they are allowed to exist... for filtering for elonmusk[0-9]* while ofc not doing anything for bots numbers, wd be at least symbolic of X one up-ing above (perceived - rightly or wrongly) level absolute zero =0 there

Another example that 1) children are clever, 2) parents are dumb. And it's all for the better, that 3) children are mostly influenced by their peer and friends. They have to put up with, but 4) children mostly ignore their parents; or rather 5) pay attention to what parents do, while 6) ignoring what parents say. This is the reason humanity slowly slowly inches forward! Because 7) children are smart-ish, while 8) parents are mostly full of sh*t.
Too bad childhood doesn't last that long. But - it's hopeful and endearing, that with getting ever more civilised, it's looking like childhood (culture) gets extended ever longer into the teenage years, and even beyond. Lord of the Flies was always grown ups propaganda. To cast a shade on the children. And to distract us from the many failures of the grownups.

Forget that. Concentrate on turning out a Grok version that's a universal translator, then miniaturise it into a Babelfish. Then we each get a Babelfish, stick them into our ears or even brains. That defeats the Babylonian languages curse.
Anything else is futile. Don't waste your time on Duolingo, or any other tool really. The number of people that can learn a new language past their teenage years is small. Once all they surplus neurons we were born with are pruned (as makes sense - they were unused), we lack the hardware for a new language that late in life to start with. Few lucky ones got the circuits to repurpose other neurons, buy most don't.
