# AI Assistant Instructions

## Optional
LJLJAIFIX is a marker in the files where I think approxmiately changes should be made. This is indicative only. Use your judgement and ignore my markers if you think you need to. It is not given that the marker exists. IT is possible no markers will be in the faile. In that case - proceed to the best of your ability.

## Task Format

```markdown

### Task Description
Create a post-chat-LJ.html, a page implementing chat functionality. Look at the other post-*.html pages in the repo (online on github at https://github.com/ljubomirj/ljubomirj.github.io), and keep to the same structure: with the sidebar on the left size implemented by sidebar.html. Add the page at the bottom of the list.
Now - the idea is that the chat is not just a chat with a generic LLM, but chat with LLM that is somehow a "LJ clone". So I want to give to that LLM a context that is all I have in the https://github.com/ljubomirj/ljubomirj.github.io about myself, and the LLM replies to reflect me. Use the open API openrouter models, for example take the model openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-chat:free . But have the model give that model the "LJ context" coming from this very repo.

### Relevant 
post-chat-LJ.html, sidebar.html

### Expected Outcome
New file post-chat-LJ.html implementing the "chat with virtual LJ" functionality.
