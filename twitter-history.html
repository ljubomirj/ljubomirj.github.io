Another @geoffreyhinton talk to enjoy. However, I find his arguments weak in these two places: <br>
Open weights vs. Centralized Control<br>
Phishing "up 1800%" looks a non argument, a trivial piffle, compared to the risk on the other side of the ledger. A tyrannical gov or corporation controlling millions of people cheaply, for the silliest and flimsiest of whims. Like forcing a dress code on me. (e.g. head cover) Or some crazy freedom of movement. ("can't leave your town Mon-Wed-Fri") And enforcing that via video, personal sensors, AI surveillance—cheaply! For tyrannies before had constraints that were costly to enforce, so could not do it fr even if they wanted to.<br>
The obvious safeguard is widely distributed powerful AI—citizenry that is AI-armed rather than AI-defenceless. I suspect his fortuitous experience may dull him to that danger. (he looks the leftie-Sanders type; holidaying in the Eastern block even post-Stalin crimes public) This looks an obvious blind spot, of the type that <br>
@michaelmalice<br>
 's White Pill is written to scream "Danger! Danger!" to. Hinton strikes me a free person, for whom at some level it's impossible to comprehend how it is fr to have anything free in you crushed relentlessly, mercilessly and without hope for salvation. Leaving a soul-less husk, almost without will to live. (maybe that's for the better in many ways; but not for all)<br>
If Trump turns for the worse and goes from Caesar to a full blown dictator, maybe he'll reconsider. Further, even the worst (atomic) weapons we got, that can end our civilisation, in Russia they are in the hands of a tyrant king for life. (they always were.) Doesn't strike me as the smartest move, to do similar with AI-s too: empower the baddies, deny at least level field MAD to the goodies. Even more so, given AI - unlike atomic weapons - has many many good applications.<br>
AI Evolution: Uncontrolled Multiplication?<br>
AI-s starting evolution competition to multiply without limit. Consuming everything and taking over. This to me seems projection of what we know of how many living creatures are. But *not all* living creatures. Famously—us humans(!), we don't do that! We don't pro-create multiply ad-infinitum even with the environmental resources (air, food, water, heath, etc) allow for that. Heck, we almost got a thermostat level control there. When families needed 5-6 kids, for 2 kids to survive to have kids of their own, that's what we humans did. Then briefly during the industrial revolution, people moving agriculture→industry and village→city, for a period 5-6 kids continued to be born, but 2-3 kids *didn't* die. (hurray!!) So we got ourselves a baby-boom.<br>
But then equally quickly, within 1-2 generations, humans stopped having babies for no single apparent reason, (many hypothesis—none definitive) and the baby-boom turned into a baby-bust. (ongoing) Seems a remarkable feat of self-control there! And if humans can do it—don't see why AI-s could not. We are creating AI-s in our image, AI-s are created in the image of the HI-s. Don't see why AI-s could not copy that self-control aspect of us HI-s too.<br>

Oooh... 😶 Usually I get a pang of joy 😈 every time he shocks a reporter that goes on him "they are not like us, are they?" and @geoffreyhinton chucks the "they are exactly like us, and they are the best models we got of how we are" riposte back. 😅<br>
But this time <@ 6'16", him expounding on "we are few data many connections, they are many data few connections, backprop seems stellar at packing lots of data at few connection". But their communication advantage is vast, and enabled by digital not analogue h/w, that we lack.<br>
They seem to just scale up better than us, and we can't hope to catch up. There was a sad shocked pause among the students listening on his "The End." 😧 Felt a note of sadness witnessing that silence.<br>
The only cope I can come up  on that is, Moravec's "they are our progeny, our `mind children', built in our image and likeness, ourselves in a more potent form." Maybe even humans HI vv. AI-s is as our imagined God vv. us humans HI; our creator God, created us Humans in his image/likeness; and now likewise we got HI vv. AI.<br>

Haha :-) - ok I grok what @pmarca's saying there, and I'm as chuffed as the next guy with the recent AI progress, 🥰 having also started with ML and NN-s in 1990-s. (and not expecting much of them.) And I wish it could have happened then. But I'm afraid I fail to see how. ☺️<br>
The "Bitter Lesson" may as well be called "The Iron Law Of (Data,Compute)". 😬 Turns out we needed all of humanity to come online, and write their brains out and in the open Internet, to get enough Data. As for compute, my own mbp M2 96GB RAM rn running gpt-4 level QwQ-32B mlx model at 6 tps is an absurd luxury by the standards of year 2000 I think?<br>
I remember-then a Sparc Station with an special card with couple of T400 transputers, with custom http://libc.so, implementing floating point libc functions in fixed point, and equipped with then unheard amount of RAM - wait for it! - of 96 MB(!!), was needed to run an ASR stack decoder. That RAM is 1000x times less, then the 96GB of my almost bog standard few years old M2 macbook next to me.<br>
So yeah. Wish what Marc's saying was true. 😆 But I don't see how it could have been. Still - far be it from me complaining, with all we witnessed in the past few years! 🤩 What a time to be alive. 🤯<br>

Boy are you your own worst enemy. In 3 years time PM Farage will undo it all. IDK how are you so established yet so stoopid. This is kindegarden level stuff. IDK how come you hold the commanding heights. It seems not for long now. You look to France for everything else. You should have looked at them for this too, and copied  what France did half a century ago. You were incapable even following someone else's success??

Seems to me you suffer from the case of bad morals. Sorry to be the one to say. Stupidity in the thinking on display is not the type of low IQ or lack of rational thinking. No—it's the type of "what I think (or vaguely feel) is good, is actually bad". Bad morals.<br>
Many have remarked by now on the spectacle of people getting personally offended(??) for other people getting fun and joy out of drawn pictures?! (excellent on the topic https://daveshap.substack.com/p/you-think-that-ai-is-destroying-art)<br>
I don't even understand how you imagine what you think good would work. You draw something I don't like, I call the police on you, we throw you in jail? So then you, I presume, self-police? We got taste-police? Only people in good taste get to create or talk or sing or draw. The rest go on mandatory education and then there is certification of ability? IDK how to imagine that world.<br>
I changed my own view on IP. Now I think all IP laws should be deleted. There are other ways to compensate creators, can be implemented should society choose to. Prior/more on that here- https://x.com/ljupc0/status/1904491968068977148.<br>

Very few parents today are unfortunate enough to burry their own children. That in my book counts for a lot.<br>
The human population size didn't change much for a very long time, 1000s of years. The steady state was: family has 5-6 kids, 2-3 die before having kids of their own, about 2 continue on, recreate the same pattern => population stable.<br>
There is a saying: people have many fears until they become parents. Then afterwards almost all of them mostly have just one fear. And it's the same fear.<br>
Edge of poverty you mention is modern poverty. Mostly relative poverty. Not absolute poverty of old, where famines were common, people dying of hunger once a decade, or continuously of infectious diseases in huge numbers. Even until fairly recently, in living memory, in some parts of the world. All my 4 grandparents were born in the Ottoman Empire. Their families had between 6 and 12 children.<br>
I'd encourage you to check data about the world like https://ourworldindata.org, or read on UN statistics like "Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About The World - And Why Things Are Better Than You Think"  https://amazon.co.uk/gp/product/147363749X.<br>
Even if I'm fully cognisant by now that people hate it totally to have their miserabilism contradicted. Maybe this will preempt some https://ourworldindata.org/much-better-awful-can-be-better.<br>

Curious to read what's your thinking. Didn't hold much definite opinion either way for a long time. But "you may not be interested in X, but X is interested in you" forced me to write down what/how I think/feel.<br>
- Euthanasia. It's hard to deny giving help someone that wants to die to die in a more, rather than less, dignified manner.<br>
  However. No one should be compelled, forced to give help, against their wish to not help someone else die.<br>
  Euthanasia should not be part of any health service. It's a state sanctioned executioner. So it should be service much closer to an executioner function.<br>
  The state is already in the business who lives and who dies. Death is admnistered by the state through the police, and the army. It's legal.<br>
  State executioner via euthanasia should be fine. But conflating that function with the Netional Health Service is dumb and wrong.<br>
  Already with "don't rescisutate" and simlar "pathways" to death being conflated with life care, patient care, health care - leads to trouble and complicaitons that are better avoided. And easily avoided.<br>

Doubt anyone takes prediction markets for perfect forecasters. Thought everyone knows they are but one way to forecast. Not the only way, and not always the best way to forecast either. <br>

Does anyone keep track if any of these forecasts are better, on whatever metrics they care about, than:<br>
1) In the period of next X months from now, that will happen, what already happened in the past X months.<br>
2) Survey dozen contributors, compute average, highlight outliers and reasons for them being so, present with past history of forecast, response, error.<br>
3) Setup @Polymarket forecasting betting competitive process.<br>
Afaik if IMF/Treasury/OBR forecasts were better than the above, those forecasters wd be in a macro hedge fund, making $$$ millions.<br>
Anyone keep track if forecasting like below subtract rather than add value? Maybe OBR/Treasury should just do 1/2/3 of the above forecasting?<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
If any of IMF/Treasury/OBR forecasts were better than-"I forecast in the next 3/6/12 months the same what happened in the past 3/6/12 moths" the people making them wd be in a macro hedge fund, making $$$ for the fund and millions for themselves. Economic forecasts are worthless in forecasting what will happen in the future with any success in accuracy afaik.<br>
Bloomberg/Reuters do (did?)  surveys within averages and maybe highlighting outliers and reasons for-but don't any method betters a baseline that is "In the period of next X months, that will happen, what already happened in the past X months"?<br>

His' "Computer Networks" is one gem of a book! Not only I enjoyed reading it immensely, but in the early day at about the time the Internet was coming in our lives ~1990, it demystified so many "well how does this thing work then" for me. Top guy in my book! 😆<br>

Yeah. Got nagging suspicion there's a business there waiting on someone to make a small fortune. Weekend AirDentist. Return ~3h flight Luton-Skopje or London-Tirana ~£100, taxi transport to/from airports both sides <£100 total, one night Sat-to-Sun AirBnB ~£100. English speaking minder accompany group of 6 to 12 to a good local dentist. Gets all done mid-Sat to mid-Sun, fly back Sun evening. But working with people, esp people in pain in need of medical intervention is difficult. (and not of much people's-person talents myself sadly)<br>

Maybe better be honest, and admit it's mostly crap-shots-all research funding decisions. Why not try an experiment: one person-proposal per 2 years allowance, up to 2 saved use-it-or-lose way, and random number generator lottery decides.<br>
Assumes equal quantas of funding sizes. Adjust for several buckets sizes accordingly. If want to weight less than random, adjust weights as per desires. Have lottery draw be somewhat-non-equal weighted.<br>

Yes qwq-32b is very good. Love that I got it on a local laptop, with me at all times. Tops my wildest expectations.

The force of gravity is terrifying and awe inspiring. 😡😫😱 Oh to know that there will be the day when humanity learns to control gravity and bend it our wills... 🤯<br>
Seems to me while humanity has made inroads with electricity, magnetism, nuclear - but little progress on gravity. We are almost as shackled to Earth as Cromagnons were. Progress = devise clever tricks how to lift loads off the earth, (and into space,) ~1K-1M times more efficiently than currently. <br>

By voting in people like Trump etc who do actually want to govern.<br>
Then we replace one problem - the deep state, that wants and exercises power, but avoids all responsibility - with another problem: people that want to govern and radically change things, are usually very unhappy people. They typically don't find fulfilment in their daily lives like most of us do.<br>
It's an impossible conundrum, a circle than can't be squared, only approximated. That we also do. We the public try minimise our losses, by trying to elect closer one end, or the other of the spectrum, by judging what's more appropriate in the current circumstance.<br>

But yeah - having a "personal Internet space", the $HOME/public_html/ page of old, is both necessary and convenient! (mine https://ljubomirj.github.io; and it sync-s via git—perfect!)<br>
And heh - preaching to the converted there- 😊<br>

You are looking for reason and evidence of reasoning where there is none.<br>
People attaching themselves to Person-ism (e.g. Marx-ism) do it to avoid thinking for themselves! Thinking is hard, is taxing, expends lots of energy, it's often unpleasant, and even painful. And confers no big survival advantage to the individual. So we avoid thinking much, and where we have to, we use our guts where we can, ("Type 1") in preference to our brains. ("Type 2") The other major plank of attraction is finding a group of people to associate with, then even having become part of your identity, of your self and so on.<br>
I have more sympathy for people that form attachment with Idea-isms. It's much harder to come up with a mutually interlocking and coherent set of ideas, that encompass a wide field of human experience. We all do Idea-ism in our lives, even when we are not noticing it much. These are our "unknown knowns", the 4-th quadrant in the {un/known,un/knowns} quartet. We swim in it, and not notice it, is like what water is to fish swimming in it. Again notice—we don't expand much mental energy to it.<br>

Given you seem interested in this, I encourage you to give 20 mins of your time to "The Landscape of Money" by @Suitpossum on YT https://youtube.com/watch?v=mmWOO7r_NMw&t=6m30s.<br>
It will became clear to you why the pounds created/destroyed by QE/QT can not enter/exit yours and mine pockets, so made not difference to me and yourself spending in the local supermarket. (and did nothing much for the economy, and to inflation)<br>
While the gov uk pounds created during the furlough scheme (coupled with supply side disruptions), had big effect to the economy (for the better—the economy survived the disruption well), and inflation (for the worse—we got inflation).<br>
And if you have ambitions towards macro trading, just learning from the above, this will put you in terms of capability to forecasting the future, above the top 80%-90% of all macro traders out there! :-)<br>
At this level, one has to be more precise with the words "money", "pound" etc. B/c what looks like a "pound" to us as layman in our ordinary daily lives, when one "zooms in" the monetary system, it stops becoming a single entity. Like a chemist "zooming in" water has to take into account molecules and atoms, and a physicists zooming in ever more, needs to start caring about the atoms and electrons etc.<br>

I don't want to disrupt your discussion. Just interjecting briefly, in case this is of interest.<br>
Pounds get destroyed when I pay my tax. (they get created with state spending)<br>
Pounds get destroyed when I pay back a tranche of my bank loan. The principal I return gets destroyed. (it was created upon loan issuance; an asset in the bank loan book, and matching liability for the bank in my current account) The interest portion is earnings for the bank. (may go in the bank profit latter, or offsets bank costs; if profit maybe taken out as dividend, or added to the bank equity)<br>

If you have exquisite taste, then it maybe looks like death to you. To others with 10x times worse sensors resolution, it probably looks like life itself. That's why they do it. And nothing-ness looks like death to them.<br>
This is like wine tasters that have 10x-100x times more the number of taste buds on their palates. Them 0.1% are simply equipped with much finer sensors, sensors with superior resolution, then the rest 0.1% of us. It's a blessing—for one gets to taste tastes and smells that most others miss. But also a curse too—the extra brings the bad with the good in them. They can no longer buy a cheapo $10 wine of a supermarket shelf and enjoy themselves! It tastes like castor oil to them.<br>
One way to experience closer to other's experience, is to make your sensors worse. Much easier done, than the other way around. (to endow someone else with 10x better sensor) So if you have good sight—put glasses that make your sight -1 short-sighted, or +1 long-sighted. Then try drive on a motorway (with that -1), or read off a mobile phone screen (with the +1). Or if you are slim not overweight, put on an actors costume, filled with extra 20kg-30kg weight around waist and upper body, then stay for the day. Repeat for a week. See how it feels.<br>

Correct, but there is a third option too: I notice a client flush with pounds, I will be tempted to ask for more money for my consulting services. Even if my costs have not increased, and there is no increase of demand for my product.<br>
And if all my fellow consultants in the same industry group do the same, then our clients will have to actually pay good way towards our asking price. As things were, my costs—the costs of living—actually did go up ~30% post Covid.<br>

A classic of the genre "IYI thinks books and models take precedence over reality". You may find it emotionally satisfying to delude yourself. But Farage, like Trump before him, is capable of counting, comparing 90 to 10, and drawing conclusions not removed from reality.<br>
As for the good professor. The description how our fiat money system works is afaics correct. The forecasts 1) QE will not cause inflation, 2) in Covid no gov will "go bust", but 3) we may get inflation, were 3 out of 3 correct. (and any macro traders worth their salt are grateful.) However—if one spends years lecturing the world "a deficit number is arbitrary, the limit is inflation", then one has to stick to their intellectual guns, once inflation does appear. (whatever the reason maybe.)<br>
Political correctness, pandering to the own tribe, while short term opportune, are longer term losing propositions. As academia is finding out now. (not something I wish on them)<br>

Did you miss @StephanieKelton's " *INFLATION* is the real limit!" ?? The very same paragraph. Did you miss or forget UK's inflation problems in the past years?? Is this the case of wishful thinking, or genuine failure in reading comprehension?<br>
Here is something for you to chew on. Given choice between options:<br>
#1) inflation - 100% of people, all of us, lose 10% of our wealth each; or<br>
#2) unemployment - 10% of people, made unemployed, lose 100% wealth; (but the 90% are just fine)<br>
In a democracy, option #2 (unemployment for few) always wins at the ballot box over option #1 (inflation for all).<br>
For unemployment and ruin for 10%, pay for life going just fine for 90% that remain employed, and without a care in the world. (given there is no inflation.) And 90% for "business as usual" is more than 10% of "life sucks" when it comes to casting our votes.<br>
Whereas option#1 (inflation for all) makes life worse for 100% of the population. Who then vote out the incumbent. And vote in the guy who promises "I will fix the inflation problem."<br>
There - mystery solved for you. A politician should have counting as core skill.<br>

Maybe there is something with the way people balance absolute versus relative gains? We all have value systems that are combinations of two types of metrics: absolute and relative. It occurs to me, if I weight absolute measures little, and relative much, then I end up caring much about redistribution, and little about creation. Maybe combined with the games playing aspect of it—redistribution seems to me being more social than creation. Creation strikes me more of a solitary pursuit. (even if I cooperate with others even in creation too)<br>

Reads like the academic establishment sucked all life out of it. Leaving a limp lifeless husk.<br>
To give some credit to academia, for decades figures like Hinton, Sutton still got funding, were not completely run out of town, even if marginalised.<br>
On the other hand, much interesting breakthroughs of "just do more, moar power!!" type pushing from a boundary out into the unknown, happened in industrial R&D. Funded by companies, and largely isolated from the malign influences of academic group think, and "you scratch my back I scratch yours" monkey business that is allocating state research funding.<br>
Academia did excellent in education of young researchers though! Can attest that having done UK higher education myself. And having two kids in the 20 years since. UK educaiton punches much much above its weight. All things considered how much UK state spends on it.<br>

Yeah agreed there—it's misallocation of resource. Or phrased differently—we hope better allocation of the same resources (human potential, energy, time, labour, materials, capital etc) is achievable. How exactly—IDK tbh.<br>
Contemporary option that comes to mind—everyone of us becomes smarter version of ourselves, more adapted, making better decisions, by being helped by AI in making decisions. AI expanding our intellectual abilities, building on the top of the extra data and information that's made available to us too by the IT and telecommunications revolutions.<br>
While being cognisant it's a tall order, as many have tried before to better us humans (e.g. the "new socialist man" I remember from my childhood), and often failed. Not all are fails though. There is rationalism and humanism that bettered us all since 1800-s. So I'm more white, than black pilled tbh.<br>

There is no rational argument to be made to others "I want you need you to live poorer harder life today because ...(something something in the future that might happen or not)". There is none.

Yeah, only-in my mind economics becomes "BIG problem" only if you have high expectations of econ. :-) <br>
To my mind, (and this goes back to mechanistic model as depicted in this excellent @RayDalio vid https://youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0), the economy is exchanging milk&eggs for greenbacks. So there are 2 sides/parties { buyer, seller } and 2 things { mlk&eggs, greenbucks } exchanged there.<br>
The greenbucks side of the exchange I think of it as Finance. There in our Fiat system, things are decided by Law. This is primary. Then operationally it is Accounting, and lately nowadays IT implementing it. I see it there being little Economics on the greenbucks side. Economics is very very important, but it's all about the other side, the milk&eggs. That side is in many way much harder to pull off. <br>
So it's to be expected, and I see why and how, things that are true for milk&eggs, are assumed to be true for the greenbucks side. But with finance being a mirror image to the economics side, that minus sign there seems to confuse the hell out of economists!<br>
I have done trading, (which is closer to finance) and there economists are not only useless, but worse than that: reliably wrong! (one can stick a "-" minus sign in front of their forecasts, and do better; in reality we don't do that.) In trading we ignore them. Where we need econ forecast like "next quarter GDP", we just take "last past quarter GDP" as forecast. That does better than 99% of econs, but with zero effort.<br>

IK if I am diligent enough, to spy the small icon reading "2" (or more) on a post, and click to expand the replies, and go through a lot of posts, then eventually will nab the one I'm looking. But once it's more than a few, and more than a few levels deep-it's just too much trouble to bother with tbh.<br>
Nowadays we got TB of disk space, GB of RAM, GHz of CPU, Gbps of network bandwidth, Kpixels of screen. I'm sure our computers can handle more than 20-50 posts. If people complain, just brush them off with "buy a better computer, you cheapskate - it's totally worth it!" <br>
This was the model of PC/upgrade-s when growing up since 1990-s, and it's worked well. Just assume-moar, and better! 😃<br>

What a cretin he is turning out to be. Oft I wonder, having seen more than a fair share of imbeciles in high places in my life, in positions of power-what possess these people to do insane things they do??<br>
But then-I know one has to be already almost clinically insane to play for power in the political system as it exists now. The system itself selects for not-psychologically well-adjusted.<br>

Sure - all other things considered. Where "all other things" involves: the other country may invade you, and or kill you. Countries war with each other all the time, no? US does it, but it's hardly the exception. IDK what you think you know, that the rest of the world doesn't.<br>
Also - note many countries are not invaded. Plus - the example you give (Libya) is one of the examples where the country was not invaded. There was no invasion by US there. (there was other involvement; and European countries e.g. UK and France more than US)<br>

...money doesn't buy 100% of happiness, but it's about 50% of it.<br>
In the following sense. If I have no money and struggle to keep food on the table and roof over my head  daily, it's much harder to be happy. Chances are I will be unhappy struggling to keep myself alive. <br>
Whereas if I can keep my bottom level Maslow hierarchy of my needs sorted, then I can devote myself to living an examined life. And maybe I will be happy, maybe unhappy, 50% chance there. But struggling to make ends meet, almost guarantees unhappiness, 90% of the time.<br>
Ofc as all things human-plenty of exceptions to all rules and stereotypes. Exceptions and outliers don't undo the averages and the expectations though.<br>

@ Fred Johnson At this level, one has to be more precise with the words "money", "dollar" etc. B/c what looks like a "dollar" to us as layman in our ordinary daily lives, when one "zooms in" the monetary system, it stops becoming a single entity. Like a chemist "zooming in" water has to take into account molecules and atoms, and a physicists zooming in ever more, needs to start caring about the atoms and electrons etc.<br>
For my money the best presentation & abstraction I know of is "The Landscape of Money" by @Suitpossum, on YT https://youtube.com/watch?v=mmWOO7r_NMw&t=6m30s. There maybe others, but this one I understand, and afaics there are no gross inaccuracies in the mechanics of things. (oft people are simply wrong in the mechanics of what moves where when why)<br>
For my taste, abstracting spreadsheets—instead of rings—works as well. It tallies ok with reality. Fed owned spreadsheet=>only Fed changes numbers up/down there. Fed manages cells names "Reserve", "T-Bill" "Note" "Bond" etc. Likewise, City bank spreadsheet=>only City changes numbers up/down, accounts names are "Checking", "Saving". The numbers are "City dollars". They stop existing (with the spreadsheet) when City goes bankrupt, is killed off by The Fed. (and deleted from the system.) The "token rings" with tokens (various dollars) moving on the wires from cell to cell, is visually ood abstraction imo.<br>

IDK how you got that from what I wrote tbh. I wrote, to my mind at least, that: we are free to do as we please, but then with other agentic creatures, they are also free to do as they please. So in the end there are consequences, to whatever we chose to do. And we navigate those to the best of our abilities. The theoretical advice given by the good professor, is a theory, that does not survive contact with reality. As far as I can see.<br>

The cowardess of US and NATO unfortunately for us all (both in NATO countries, and not) invites more aggression and further escalation. Wish that was not true. But it's simply empirical evidence at this point that that's what happens.<br>

Yes—but you should consider the other side of the ledger too. Why do other countries find it more desirable to hold US treasuries, compared to the alternatives, when all other things are considered and net tallied, of their own free wills? You are considering 1/2 of the picture.<br>

My understanding is he already knew that in Syene, on that one day of the year, at noon, the shadow was length exactly zero.<br>
("Syene (modern Aswan), it was recorded that at noon on the summer solstice, the Sun was directly overhead, meaning objects cast no shadow.")<br>
So he only had to measure the length of the shadow on that very same day of the year, at noon exactly, in Alexandria.<br>
("Eratosthenes realized that if they measured the shadow of a pole in Alexandria at the exact same time (solar noon), any difference in shadow length would indicate that the Earth’s surface was curved.")<br>

Yep—a police, a Sherlock Holmes-type "investigation" collecting evidence judged  possibly relevant, and subsequent "trial" to tally up the pro-s and the contra-s of the evidence, and come to a binary yes/no conclusion, is imo the right way to think about this.<br>
The http://rootclaim.com methodology implements some of this afaics. Write down all evidence collected. Quantify the evidence with a view towards the outcome. The "probability theory as the logic of science" view makes every sense to me. See E.T.Jaynes "Probability Theory: The logic of Science" book, and there are other texts too.<br>
The @Rootclaim methodology applied to C19 example here<br>

😄 Heh - if only that were true, the world would be a simpler place to navigate.<br>
Yes, we are free to name something else (person, country, river) etc however we very well please. With entities that "have agency" of some sort (person, country - yes; river - no), then they are free to take pleasure, or offence, or anything in between, as they please too. (to our naming them.) So there is that for us to consider too. 😅 And we usually do consider! 😊<br>

If that was true, there would 2 groups of countries in the world - with-ID, and without-ID, and the with-ID group would have 90% of the problems only, of the without-ID countries. Whichever way the terms like "100%", and "problems" are measured. (Where by "ID" I mean "single national obliged mandated by the state ID". B/c we all use multiple ID-s in our daily lives in the UK, only they are not single, not mandated by the state and so on.)<br>
There is simply zero evidence for that, I'm afraid.<br>
In reality, they solve some problems, possibly problems you encounter in your daily life. While creating new problems, where there are none now, for some other people. To a net gain of "problems solved" of zero imo.<br>
I lived in a with-ID country for the first 30 years of my life, before emigrating to, and settling in, the UK. When everything is tallied up, I think the UK without-ID system works well enough. And certainly better than in other places, both without-ID and with-ID.<br>
I know many people would like "with-ID better" to be true. And I wish it was, for there would be a simple and known fix to "reduce 10% of our problems". I'm afraid it is not, to the best of my knowledge. Previously I've opined on this here<br>

It doesn't. There is "a great deal of ruination in a nation", but it's not infinite. If people in charge are dunderheads that's not great but suffices most of the time, as it's "business as usual".<br>

Well—afaics Trump US is "Canada join US", and Canada is "No!" So there's that. Ofc the future is unknown. Things may happen then, that seems inconceivable now. Starting an economic war with Canada may have seemed unlikely a year ago. War does not seem to me that inconceivable. US invades countries and starts wars not infrequently.<br>

Well—empirically, starting a war with Canada, and another with Denmark, aligns with the Russias geo-political interests. So that part is not delusion, but very real. Russia's interests are real.<br>

I used to joke "what would Merkel have done differently if she were to be an FSB sleeper agent".<br>
Now I look at Trump foreign policy and think "what would Trump do differently if he were an FSB sleeper agent". Starting a war with a neighbour (Canada), a war with one of your own allays (Denmark) to shatter the alliance existing both sides of the Atlantic, sounds like a pretty solid plan of action to further Russia interests tbh.<br>

It blows my mind that most of H2O mollecules that ever existed on Earth have been recycled about forever. That 60% of my body that is H2O after I die will be recycled in the ground, in the rivers, the clouds, then used to make some other body  of a worn, or a bird, or a dog, or indeed another human. Like LEGO blocks. And the process is occuring daily, about 1 litter per day too.<br>
IK the same is true of every atom. As with scarcity of natural atomic reactions and natural decay, it can't be otherwise. Still H2O being molecule (even a simple one) not mere atoms feels more interesting. Maybe b/c we drink it, can taste it, can feel it. Unlike elementary atoms.<br>

Do you have any tips for students or other budding researchers about research in general? How to choose what to work on, how to how to make good progress?<br>
28:06<br>
Yes, I think I do. Get a research notebook and write in it every day. Write what, write your thoughts, and and and work on your thoughts. Try to challenge them and make them better. If you want other people to be interested in what you think, then you should start by caring about it yourself, and you should care about at least enough to write it down and challenge it and develop it to progress it. That's the most important thing. I hit on that strategy, and it really changed my whole trajectory.<br>
28:41<br>
It's really hard to do because it's a blank page, and you know, what do you have to say? And maybe you're not, maybe you're confused about what you're what you're thinking. One saying I thought to help with that is that usually the value of writing down your thoughts is directly proportional to how vague and confused they are. The value is proportional to how hard it is to write them right. If you say, "I don't even know how to—I'm thinking six things at once. I can't possibly write this down," that's when it will be super valuable. When you do write something down, is that a way that you know that you have an idea that you really want to pursue? Is that a sign?<br>
29:21<br>
No, it's it's that would be scary. It's got to be just like you and the page, and you're trying to be clear to yourself about what you're thinking. If you can't think of anything else to write, just write down what you think are the six interesting ideas that you've got rolling around in your head. So, just then write them down, one through six. Then say, "Well, is that really all of them? Is there a seventh one?" Well, are these six ideas really two of them the same, or just take another paragraph on each one of those six things and explain what you meant by it. Explain to yourself what your thought is.<br>
29:59<br>
And just by doing that, you will say, "Oh, now that thought kind of just disappeared into nothingness when I tried to explain it." You know, maybe it isn't anything. You know, or maybe it grew and changed as you wrote it down. All those things will happen. And so it's important just to keep, keep, keep writing. Try to do a page a day. Don't, don't stress out too much, but do keep doing it on a regular basis. That's my advice.<br>

I am amazed Europe is still relying on US BigTech. USA of the MAGA and TBPR (Tech Bro Progressive Right) laser focused on perceived China threat. Joining forces with Russia at light speed, will be casting Europe as their common enemy within months it looks to me. GNU/Linux, open source open weights open thoughts open agents, open everything is the obvious solution in the lands of the Internets. Too bad for Europeans they are not tech-conscious, and their elites are phobic word-cells not doers. This may change the first time Google shuts down portions of their Gmail on Trump orders.<br>

Afaik there is no "China" as in "The China" as this single one entity, that decided to do this or the other. This strikes me as the wrong abstraction to use. What there is—is hundreds of millions of people doing their thing: stuff they like, find profitable, or simply possible, within the constraints of the system they live in.<br>
I doubt very much anyone too high up the CCP knew of DeepSeek before R1. And if they knew, whether they would be approving of. Or more likely—hostile to a quant trading firm speculating on the financial markets.<br>
Listening to the founder Liang Wenfeng‘s interview https://youtu.be/LknX8qXsgfA?si=aHchfzCjpvkacf8v, he strikes me as an idealistic person that finally got the means to do stuff he really wanted to. Being in the same industry (quant trading), even if not in China, I have witnessed idealism like this more than once. Am always amused how distant-as-to-be-impossible explanation, it seems to be, to outsiders.<br>
"Open source, open weights, open thoughts"—the latest now today, probably tomorrow "open agents"—is the winning combination when striving for personal agency, personal liberty, for taking control, in the information age we live in.<br>
What else is there? My personal life controlled by a MegaCorp, or a MegaState, for whom I'm less than an ant? They could squash me and not notice. That's how big the power disparity is. So the appeal to "open everything" to redress in parts that imbalance, seems reasonable and understandable to me.<br>
I'm always surprised by how obscure the foundational ideas of the Internet remain—especially to people who've grown up entirely within it. Just yesterday met an eager earnest student (opining on "ai safety") that was born and has grown in the lands of the Internets. And yet—he'd never heard of GNU or @fsf or the ideas of Richard Stalman! This seems like living in a market economy, yet being unaware of markets. Maybe that's a shape a victory takes—becoming ideology, "unknown knowns", water to the fish swimming in it.<br>
I've yet to meet a normie who realizes the Personal Computer revolution, the Internet revolution, and now the AI revolution were all kicked off by mildly autistic, mostly altruistic nerds—for almost no expected compensation, just the joy and glory of creation.<br>

(or Amazon Video? could have been both-stumbled serendipitously on one, then looking for similar on the other)<br>
The TV channels of my childhood would never carry such niche content for us. In Brazil locally latter I learned the series were not unknown if not exactly massive hits. Their quality was not in doubt, even imo.<br>

Mine have evolved into thematic long threads. At some point I start a new one, and copy & paste some context from the old thread. Got about 6-10 going now for some time. Guess about tallies with personal global interests?<br>
I guess in the extreme it would be a branching tree. "I" at root, branches getting longer... "thicker" might be better abstraction? Then, at some point a branch branches. Either in two branches of about equal width. Or small branch sprouts sideways starting very thin compared to the main one. (that's much thicker.)<br>
They keep growing as new stuff is added at the ends. I rarely have doubts which one to extend with a new query. I guess that would be one sign of "too much branching": if one is unsure, is not immediately obvious, which branch to extend.<br>

Half is a-plenty! :-) Better than all the alternatives tried.<br>
Truth is—research is super expensive. People never hear about all the technologies that never panned out even after decades of investment. What "did not pan out" means—people working on for many years, payed wages, and then nothing to show for it.<br>
Another way of saying: it's an uncertain business. May pan out, or may not. Every time applying for research grants, it felt fake, it felt a lie, having to answer "write down what you will discover in the 3 years". Well—if I already knew, it means it was discovered already. Not current Research then!<br>
(afaik - people got around by saying "I will discover in 3 years", portions of what they already discovered in the past 3 years; plus a bit of vague hopium on top)<br>

It still amazes me their thinking about other things though. (not strictly tech) For example, reading something on FB. "Mum, when you see it, it simply means someone, someone exactly like yourself, wrote what they think about something, and want to tell the world. That's it. Doesn't mean anything else. Doesn't mean it's true, doesn't mean it's false. It's exactly as if yourself wrote on FB what you think of that same thing."<br>

Maybe simply people not examining their lives, stuck in a "me, myself and I" baby-like stage? Not separated the "I" from "not-I" (=the world at large) that we all start as/with at birth? (could say-our death is the ultimate separation there)<br>

I remember when SORN (Statutory Off Road Notification) was introduced in law (or came into force), someone mentioned:<br>
"This is a rare piece of legislation, where one can break this law, by doing nothing. By just sitting at home doing nothing, one breaks the law."<br>
It struck me as a good principle - a good law should not be broken by inactivity, by doing nothing imo. Yes exceptions exists, yes rules of thumb can be broken.<br>
But imo - can be broken with a good reason only. And the law that brought SORN looks to me as breaking a good principle, but without a good reason.<br>

Step 1. Detach from the real world, become completely un-bound from reality. Step 2. Construct alternative reality as per your primal wishes. Step 3. ???<br>
I can't figure the Why in the step 3. One would have to speculate the psychology, the state of mind of people doing it. Rational analysis does not suffice.<br>
Drama, maybe comedy can shed light? The "guitar for sale" joke by @rickygervais 😂 Or like when on X, random people being shown some post of his, think *he* wrote to them *personally*, and get angry. ("why are you telling me this??") Like when a boomer mum reads a FB post, and mutters "why is my Friend writing this to me?" (narrator: she is not writing to you, but to the word in general; you are part of that world, but not the the only part)<br>
Parliament is younger though. Maybe millennial children to boomer parents?? 😶 IDK. One can only resort so stereotypes at this point. The "me, myself and I" generations, where a baby has not quite grown up, not separated the "I" from "not-I" (=the world at large) that it starts as at birth.<br>
Anyways. It's a spectacle, it's collective. Looks a mass psychosis of some sort. A "mind virus" even! 😱<br>

You can read say stats about the real world on OWID if you want to know. They collect and collate data collected from reputable UN and national statistics agencies in a easily digestible comparison graphs.<br>
Doomer thinking is not only unproductive, but leads towards a stalin levels of insanity. If one starts with "8B will die in near future, with absolute 100% certainty". Then any solution, no matter the cost, becomes not only morally just, but a moral imperative. (.e.g one needs to delete 4B of us people Thanos-style, to save the other 4B)<br>
The error of this thinking is "100% certainty the world will end sometime in the future." Anyone claiming to know about the future with absolute 100% certainty is lying to you. (maybe to themselves too) Future is impossible to know with 100% certainty. (one very definition of future is "that what can't be known with 100% certainty.")<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
It's implied in your mind. But not in everyone else's.<br>
That same "will deny the premise is true, for I hate the consequences" (that I infer, imagine) is what also drives the denial with the goldbugs, and cryptos people. One would expect with them being directly interested in the mechanics of the monetary system (and in general - the finance side), to at least know the mechanics of the current fiat system.<br>
They imagine the consequences to be - Gosplan! They recoil in horror, and proceed to deny the premises. Now I'm not saying there are zero people who are indeed attracted to the premise, b/c they are attracted to the Gosplan consequence. The world is a big place. All sorts of people. Some will be wanting Central Planning of the economy.<br>
My point is - that doesn't necessarily follow from the premises. Yes one of the things possible - but other things are possible too. Got reminded again with the fun spectacle 😁 recently of Musk discovery of "dozen computers that just credit dollars into recepients accounts out of thin air!" bombshell. 😂<br>
(2ndary point: with all the consolidation cartelization monopoly power in all industries we have witnessed in our lifetimes - are we sure the system isn't already half descended into a Gosplan?)<br>

Well there is always tension, that's why 1 vote in 4 years, MP is not a simple pass through conduit of the wishes of the constituents, but has to synthesise the best for 1) them, 2) him, and 3) the country. That's why e.g. US a Republic - b/c the demos can be plenty bad, do plenty wrong too.<br>
We have the California example where putting everything to popular vote gave them rule so dysfunctional, that people are fleeing the richest state in the US. There is also the case of Switzerland where devolved power works better it seems.<br>
Imo it's not so much up or down, left or right - but smart v.s. stupid. The decision making judged by the results. Quangos were seemingly made for a world where not much change happens, no fast reactions needed. Now we are in a fast changing world. The old system does not suffice, it's falling short.<br>
My favourite hobby horse is Radical Transparency. Imo much more about the inner workings of government bureaucracy needs to be open, avilable online for all to read. ("with enough eyes, all bugs are shallow.") These are gargantuan systems of people, rules, procedures etc. The sooner it's seen what's obv wrong in the process, the sooner a chance to remedy.<br>

The idea that there is some "objective" criteria leading to "objective" decision which is "the best" was always convenient fiction to hide narrow interests behind the "objective". Oldest trick in the book. "I'm not ideological. It just so happens what benefits me is objective, even natural order of things."<br>
The experts are there to give advice, not to decide. Given power to decide—well the experts pursue their own interests. Who wold have known? They are only people. Coupled with surprisingly badly though out legislation leading to "team bat, team newt" but no "team human"?? (let's see if things improve when AI Lawyer v3 comes online 🙃 )<br>
All in all—ends with quangos becoming a case of "good servant, bad master". It was too convenient for a while to pretend. Yeah time to "take back control", haha. We have all become brexiteers now. 😂<br>

Good piece. You identified the problem. Politicians have responsibility without power. Quangos have power without responsibility. Responsibility is the feedback part of exercising  power given to you by the demos. By separating the two, the feedback mechanism was broken. That's why it seems the country is on autopilot, not responding to the wishes of the electorate. Because the mechanism to do so has been broken.<br>
You must abolish OBR, abolish Sentencing Council, and then bunch of others, if you want to do stuff as per your election promises. TBS if this LAB government has that in them. IDK what's the issue with KS just abolishing them with a stroke of a pen in a single day. Will LAB MPs bring down the gov and force elections? Unlikely I think. MPs are cognisant half of them will not be re-elected if new elections were held tomorrow.<br>

Sorry, maybe I misunderstand: there is no counter-argument. As I had not watched the video yet when commenting. As mentioned - could not watch it but still decided to comment as the open source nature of R1 is a bit of a hobby horse of mine, couldn't help myself. (was in a pub after a walk on a sunny day, couldn't play the video;  English countryside pic below to brighten your day maybe).<br>
After watching now - yes the video does not make a big deal out of the "open source, open weights, open thoughts" of R1. That imo was the big deal, on par with the performance. For if the release was just another closed model to chat or API with, like ChatGPT or Claude or Gemini, maybe would have been a sensation (given o1 was the only thinking model then), but not a game changer. I think the open aspect of it was a total game changer, as it spawned a new ecosystem.<br>
Also I heard no mention of the "week of open source releases" (done recently) when DeepSeek open sourced 6 crucial components of their tech stack. Imo they have all been well received. But 1 of the 6, the RL algorithm used, has been taken on used by others, inspired them, who used it and improved it. And thus spawned a mini revolution in thinking models. Before R1 release, IDK how many people even thought RL was possible or practical. Basically how o1 was trained was a mystery.<br>

Dislike commenting before watching, but: if DeepSeek didn't release "open source, open weights, open thoughts" it would have been a nothingburger. It's the open angle that's spawned an ecosystem building up now.<br>
FB Lamma was the initial chink in the armour, opening in the "close everything" doom descending on us with the AI age. But DeepSeek V3 and R1 especially was the game changer that opened the floodgates.<br>
Releasing their prop secrets and especially RL recepies truly cemented the change. Irreversible now, despite what Darios of the world say or want having crossed over to the dark side.<br>
A single ray of light suffices to illuminate vast darkness. A single amber starts a new flame. 🔥 Could not be prouder of a fellow quant, 😍 the other side of the world. 🌎 Kudos to them.<br>

Note you saying Democracy. The system of DemoCracy (=rule of the demos) is means to an end. Not an end in itself. If Radical Transparency facilitied a somewhat different system, while still delivering on people's desires wishes hopes for themselves and their children - I see nothing wrong there.<br>
I suspect Radical Transparency for State, Government etc buroucracy is the direction of travel. It takes feedback to keep a gargantuan system on the straight and narrow. So it's both needed, and made possible by the IT and communications technologies.<br>

Naah. Biology is not like physics where a single equation written on one page of paper suffices. Even there - half the heavy  lifting is provided by mathematics.<br>
Biology is a weak general rule + million of edge cases. Before computers, there was simply no way to record that million. Now with  computers biologists can. With AI that's moved to encoding then transforming that knowledge into something useful we care to achieve.<br>

Haha - kindred spirit. 😅 Agreed again! Yes makes sense for intelligent signal processing to happen with subsidiarity: at the lowest level where there is enough information for a decision to be made. And continue at multiple levels up. At this point I'd point at<br>

Yes! :-) Agreed. (didn't wan't to elaborate)<br>
Related pet hypothesis: there is not much going in the gut, or the heart etc. It's all in the brain. There is cross-talk in the neurons (the way for there is for the word "hot", and hot food, if I recall correctly): we feel butterflies in the stomach, because some processing related to signals coming from the stomach, happens in neurons close by in the brain, to the neurons processing say risk or uncertainty or danger etc. Or love feelings being processed by neurons close by to ones processing signals communicating with the heart.<br>

Procrastination. Employ someone to do the tasks for you if you possibly can, TaskRabbit style. For tasks involving a computer typing on keyboard - I try use AI agents nowdays. If programming, even when not strictly faster, I find it to be less boring with company. AI programming agents are cheap or even free, find them totally worth it.<br>
Not being solo all alone with the boring task - it should become easier to do. Same for not computer stuff - seek company. Boring task becomes less boring when done in company of someone else, not doing it alone. Even when that someone else is AI agent.<br>
Having said that. If I found myself being bored to death by everything I am to do today—I would be re-examing my life choices. What do I want to work on, how do I want to live my life. But once in a while—I find it fine. Not everything is super exciting every single day.<br>

Procrastination is not a time management problem. It’s an emotion management problem.<br>
You’re not avoiding work. You’re avoiding tasks that feel boring, frustrating, or stressful.<br>
Postponing prolongs pain. The dread of starting is quickly outweighed by the joy of progressing.<br>

There is a good observation by @michaelmalice (who I'm binge listening to for few days now, having YT algo serendipity do it's job well) that black pilled people hate and will pounce on a single while pilled person. B/c a single while pilled out there is a danger, it ruins their world view.<br>
When the world view is "*everything* is bad, everything is shit", then a single person piping up "akshually this one thing improved" repudiates the *everything*. That one crack letting single ray of light into the darkness, destroys the whole worldview system. So this one voice can't be allowed to exist.<br>

But where does the single file live? I'm in the single file camp. Git sync-ing via push merge etc works good, no fear of losing changes. Fwiw not a comfortable experience on a mobile. (non iPhone)<br>
Standard but at home ~/logBook ascii text file as in any project. Entry  starts as ^-(space), ends in empty line, searchable in vim. New entries added at top, pushing oldies down. Sections  FIXME TODO DONE DONTDO. Entries move from TODO into DONE wholesale without further  editing. Entries in TODO  for long enough are moved into DONTDO without ceremony. (can always move them back) No adding to TODO while FIXME is non-empty without a good reason.<br>

I wish I knew of a way to immunise the society and public discussion from the malign influence of doomers. It's too easy for doomers to take over! We see it in the public policy in energy, and also AI. The AI case is not the exception but the rule, replayed with every new tech. (c.f. @PessimistsArc)<br>
We are wired that way, to pay great attention to the possible risks. Subsequently, false alarms where the dangers didn't pan out, are forgotten and memory holed straight to /dev/null.<br>
The alternative history where the society would have been, the opportunity loss, is usually not given much thought. In the long run, this opportunity cost of opportunities lost, matters a lot!<br>
When one start from a thesis that 8B will die at some point in the future, with absolute 100% certainty, say by 2125. Then if a solution exists, but needs to delete 4B of us people Thanos-style, to save the other 4B, that policy becomes not only morally just, but even a moral imperative!<br>
This is stalin-level-insanity line of thinking doomers  engage in. It's how deaths cults work. No one starts with "I'm Thanos-evil, follow and obey". No - it's always for saving of humanity. Lesser evil, means justifying ends, etc - to save something that will be lost in the far future.<br>
The error of this thinking is "100% certainty the world will end sometime in the future." Anyone claiming to know anything about the future with absolute 100% certainty is lying to you. (maybe to themselves too) Future is impossible to know with 100% certainty. (one very definition of future is "that what can't be known with 100% certainty.")<br>

Third option: they have other priorities. They prioritise something else more. In the US case: the economy. The economy for the vast number of Americans didn't deliver as per their desires. So they voted for change.<br>
The institutions, democracy, how people are governed - that's means to and end. Not the end itself. "How" matters less to people than their personal well being. (or even "life, liberty, pursuit of happiness").<br>
If an authoritarian dude says "it's bad, I will fix it" he will win over the institutionalist that messages "it's mostly fine, and that other guy is going to be Caesar". And if the newly elected Caesar manages to turn things around fr, (unlikely - but not impossible,) then he will be crowned king for life by the plebs.<br>

When you start from a thesis that 8B will die at some point in the future, with absolute 100% certainty. (say 2125 is end of the world for you maybe? IDK what it's your forecast.) Then if a solution exists, but needs to delete 4B of us Thanos-style, to save the other 4B, then it becomes not only morally just, but even a moral imperative, to do so.<br>
This is stalin-level-insanity line of thinking you are engaging in. It's how every death cult ever in history worked. No one starts with: I'm Thanos-evil, follow and obey. No-it's always for saving of humanity. Lesser evil means justify ends to save something that will be lost in the far future.<br>
The error of your thinking is "100% certainty the world will end sometime in the future." Anyone claiming to know anything about the future with absolute 100% certainty is lying to you. (and maybe themselves too) One very definition of future is "that what can't be known with 100% certainty."<br>
Although with yourself and those around you, revealed preferences tilt more towards "difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it." For if you really believed in your "end of times" catastrophizing, you'd be building shelters down salt mines, or rockets to other planets.<br>
For whatever measures you propose, will do zilch, nothing, for the thing you fear. Possible explanations to reconcile ideas and actions may involve psychotic do nothing bed wetter, a grifting grifter suckling at that sweat, sweat government tit, caring not for driving millions into poverty in the process.<br>
No change will happen with the current CO2 trajectory.  Even if UK sank today in the ocean and you achieved your net zero goal by dinnertime. We had 1C warming in the past 80 yrs. The world has never been in better shape looking at OWID consolidated graphs. All things considered, and compared to the recent past. In a century by 2125, Manchester England may end with the average temperature that Milan Italy has today.<br>

Team human - when?<br>
It's been more than a decade. Closing coal was a great success. Pocket that win, and move on. Given the state of the world, UK could sink in the ocean achieve Net 0 overnight, and it will make 0 difference to anything climate related.<br>
The energy policy is causing immiseration to millions now. My local CoOp in one of the well off towns in SE England is now locking toothpaste and gaviscone on the shelves in plastic boxes. If you don't scrap your the ill thought energy policy soon, in 3 years the newly elected PM Farage will get rid of it for sure anyway.<br>
Rarely can one see slow motion self own shooting oneself in the foot in real time. The energy policy is the textbook definition of stupid "one causing loss and suffering to others, for no gain to themselves or even a small loss".<br>
Tbf I think you will not change in time. Have yet to see a politician that's not an egomaniac or psychologicaly damaged in some way. Bothering to write this only b/c can't get to sleep. And b/c it's painfully obvious to all outsiders that policy change is a must.<br>

Not if one needs lots of RAM. I got 2nd hand M2 MBP for the 96GB of RAM, supplanting previous Linux Thinkpad 64GB RAM 4TB SSD. Addressing the lack of disk space with external 4TB NVME. (with TB5 would have been perfect)<br>

Exactly - you don't know. No one can know, just by a number like "41%". For numbers like "one in six", "41% of the species" to acquire meaning, you are to compare them, to similar numbers, as they were 20-30-50-100 years ago.<br>
I would forward you to sources like aggregates of reputable data coming from UN, national agencies etc collected, collated and nicely presented in Our World in Data, or books like Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About The World - And Why Things Are Better Than You Think by the late Rosling—but I won't. I have learned my lessons. Concluded that it's between futile and counterproductive. If someone is driven to find truths about the world around us—they find them themselves. And for those that are not—well that's it, no one can help much.<br>

So that you spend significant portion of your life working, rather than spend your time watching daytime TV and producing nothing of value to society. (or even to yourself) That's the reason.<br>

This is awesome you are awesome thanks for releasing open weights! 😍<br>
Do you plan on releasing a tiny version, that we use as crutch in speculative decoding? In LMStudio for Gemma-3 27B I have the 4B version to point LMStudio to for speculative decoding. Or  maybe some other open weights tiny model is compatible with QwQ-32B for speculative decoding? (but LMStudio doesn't know is not telling me when I select QwQ-32Bl; tbf I have not bothered to measure if plugging in the smaller model and turning on speculative decoding helps in the final analysis for {speed,performance} in total; this on MBP M2 LMStudio)<br>
Thanks again for making the world a better place. 🥰<br>

Of the 3 mentioned—on price, mature tech, 100% reliability—only nuclear can be done, is done, and was done. And with France solving the problem half a century ago, and given France-anything is supposed to be to English elite what red rag is to a bull, I hoped people come to their senses.<br>
But no. Jollies like tidal is thrown in there. As if it's ever been done by anyone in the world. R&D is very very expensive. The cost of getting it wrong is massive. As UK we are finding that out at our expense. Elites have the duty of care and doing their homework to the utmost of their abilities.

There is a sensible way forward.<br>
Conservative voters and leaners want energy to be produced as cheaply as possible, increased energy security, and the creation of new jobs.  These voters recognise the role that tidal, nuclear and solar can play in achieving these priorities.<br>

...in crypto lingo, I think of the huge effort and fight that goes into each of the "Appropriation Bill"-s as MINING, that's when it's decided who gets what. Then operationally crediting accounts is ADD, taxation operation is DELETE. (taxes are decided in a different law)<br>
There is also a SWAP operation. When some dollars (that you can swap for milk&eggs; but you get 0 extra for holding them) call them "greenbuck", are swapped 1:1 for anther type call them "bluebuck", (swap duration 1yr=Bill, 5yr=Note, 10yr=Bond,) where the greenbuck holder relinquishing it gets >0 extra (the IR interest rate) greenbucks at the end of the swap period, in a PROOF OF STAKE way. (the extra given out is like UBI for people that already have greenbucks, and voluntarily decide forego exchanging them for milk&eggs for pre-set time; they preference getting extra greenabacks instead of milk&eggs.)<br>
That's 30% of dollars added/deleted. The other 70% of the same is outsource to the commercial banks. They are authorised by the state to do ADD. These are loans given. Instead of the Appropriation Bill in Senate/Congress there is looking for credit worthy customers by the credit officer of the bank. The DELETE operation is repaying back of the loan by the private customer. This is also backed by state monopoly of violence. Service the state provides to its agent—the commercial bank.<br>
Given for the 70% (private side) say for every new 100 minted by loans, 150 is returned over the lifetime of the loans, IDK what happens to the 50 extra. Would dearly like to know! (I suspect it's added to the "bank equity" cell in addition to leaking out as dividends, salaries other costs, but IDK for sure; also suspect bank equity is subtracted from when loan is declared not recoverable; that's a 100 DELETE-ed on the private side; should the total equity go under 0, become negative, the bank is bankrupt; is then killed off by it's creator, ultimately The Fed/regulator)<br>
These things are decided by Law. Then operationally it is Accounting, and lately IT implementing. Note there is little Economics in the process. Economics is a about the other side, the milk&eggs. The greenbuck side of the exchange I think of it as Finance. (my impression from trying to learn is—economists are the ones you should listen the least when trying to learn about the Finance side; they're mostly wrong about it; as if with finance being a mirror image to the economics side, that minus sign there confuses the hell out of them.)<br>
For my money the best presentation & abstraction I know of is "The Landscape of Money" by .@Suitpossum (pic below), on YT https://youtube.com/watch?v=mmWOO7r_NMw&t=6m30s. For my taste, abstracting spreadsheets—instead of rings—works as well. It tallies well with reality. Fed owned spreadsheet => only Fed changes numbers up/down there. Fed manages cells names "Reserve", "T-Bill" "Note" "Bond" etc. Likewise, City bank spreadsheet => only City changes numbers up/down, accounts names are "Checking", (in the UK where I'm "Current",) "Saving". The numbers are "City dollars". They stop existing (with the spreadsheet) when City goes bankrupt, is killed off by The Fed, and deleted from the system. The "token rings" with tokens (various dollars) moving on the wires from cell to cell, is visually great abstraction imo.<br>
This is my personal understanding of how things work, pieced together from working in it (for limited time), and reading about it. It's mostly evolved, an ecosystem, where portions are repurposed as the system adapts to the changing environment. (e.g. last big change was becoming not-convertible in gold) There is no central plan or planner. Most people don't know how things work in total. (neither they need to; that's why it lives on—it works, even if most participants don't know how)<br>
State money. For the mechanics of the state money system, you have mmt-ers like .@wbmosler to read. They are correct about the premises of the system. People dismiss the premises, b/c they don't like the conclusion: the central planning GosPlan aspect to it. To my mind, that's doubly wrong. One should not wilfully blind self to the reality. (however unpalatable it maybe.) If you don't like the conclusions like "central planning" (I don't!)—well work on that then. Given the level of monopoly and cartels in the system already (mostly per industry)—maybe it's to a greater extent than we care to admit already centrally planned rn! Admitting to the GosPlan problem is the first step towards changing it, hopefully for the better.<br>
Private (bank) money. Richard Werner has researched and run an observational study (spent time in a bank credit office), and written books and articles https://perplexity.ai/search/princes-of-yen-prof-warner-qiFldXIrS7CsjAIeinMbUg#1 I see there is a web site https://professorwerner.org now. (at some point noticed a "Prof Werner" X acc; I thought an impersonator; then during covid acc went vaxcrazy imo; allow it possible it was the original going "Ignaz Semmelweis"; can see how that happens to a person driven to telling the truth; in an environment hell bent on lying.)<br>

It was always thus.<br>
If you think about it - the tenured professorship in the US, where the professor can not be fired, is setup exactly in the way to allow people to speak up their mind. To not be intimidated easily. Yet not many do.<br>
In trading/tech/business there is a concept of "Fuck You Monney". (FYM) When one is financially secure, so they can't be blackmailed to toe the line, bend the knee. Still-many don't make much with that. Most people don't have any particularly strong thoughts of their own. Just go with the flow.<br>
None are silver bullet. People we are so weak willed. We decide to not publicly speak, what we speak privately, for the most trivial of reasons. Like a tenured professor will decide to keep quiet b/c s/he will not be invited to a dinner party. A captain of industry will care that some random journo will write a bad word on him in a random Substack.<br>
Turns out-no matter how much your Maslow needs are taken care of and secure, there is always something to lose. Or fear sth like disapproval of, of disparagement by, people you would rather like you or rate you. Most of the time, the loss is trivial compared to what's at stake.<br>
It's heart breaking. Oft I think of Solzhenitsyn "We know they are lying, they know they are lying, they know we know they are lying, we know they know we know they are lying--and they still lie!" when the issue of truth and speaking it up comes to mind.<br>

Hm, maybe. But isn't it the case that there is simply too many posts, and not enough eyes? Back of envelope calc. I follow 5K accounts. Each acc writes 1 post a day = 5K posts/day. I login to X. X algofeed serves me 50 posts on one screen full. I check X 10 times per day = 500 posts X to show me daily. That's 500 out of possible 5K to be shown. And 4.5K will not be shown. X algo will decide which 500, out of 5K possible, will show me. Any one acc has probability 0.1 to be seen by me. Or I will see 1 post from 1 acc once in 10 days. Am I missing something?<br>

You get their eggs, they get your green pieces of paper. Poorer or richer - depends, what do you value more? The eggs, or the green paper?<br>
If it's a free exchange, on the free will, a free decision without duress, on both sides, the fact both sides freely chose the transaction, means both sides value both sides of the transaction exactly the same. That's why the transactions happens. At the levels of eggs (number of), and the green scraps of paper (total sum), at which  the exchange happens.<br>
When your household buys eggs from the supermarket, which side benefits more? You, or the supermarket? I think both benefit about equally. Otherwise you would not be buying the eggs, and the super market won't be selling them to you, for the green bucks they exchange them for.<br>
Countries are big places, with millions of people. So when it's said "both countries benefit", does not translate to "every single person in the 100M people that make the country is better off". It's possible some are better off, and some are worse off. It's just that it nets positive in value for the 100M people in the country as a whole. Usually with tariffs, the benefit is small, but accrues to millions of people. While the dis-benefit is large, and accrues to say thousand people.<br>

TBF I don't care about media coverage as I don't consume any other media but social media. Probably a-typical but also possibly not.<br>
I saw recently on YT a political/related interview where the audience (a very politically engaged one!) was asked "raise your hand if you watch BBC 6pm News Live" and not one hand went up!<br>
I need my representatives to communicate 1:1 to myself. Having the PR office disseminate their information 1:N once a day or a week is a model befitting the pre-Social Media age. That model no longer suffices imo.<br>
I'd look at US, and imo I'd be looking into the future. Something that will happen in the UK in 6-18 months. All old media have lost their audiences. New media audiences dwarf old ones in numbers by an order of magnitude.<br>

I like them too. I find it useful that when I read the highlighted words in addition to listening to a lecture, my attention does not drift away, but it's kept on the lecture, on the topic.<br>
(otherwise, when only listening on YT, oft I find myself after 10 mins that I have drifted away thinking about something else not really listening to the lecture.)<br>
Arguably a free user, and I am cognisant that this is taking liberties and looking a gift horse in the mouth. However, if you are looking for feedback on improvements:<br>
1) Make the YT video and the transcript in separate frames or tabs or windows, such that I can still scroll the text down (don't mind that I need to scroll down manually; aids keeping my attention on the lecture tbh), while the video plays at the top of the browser window and I can see the video there. So I have both the video, and the running text highlighter in my view at the same time.<br>
2) Allow for the video to take more of the space at the top of the screen. When watching a lecture like e.g.<br>

Haha 😆 - the dude is useless clueless even as propagandist! This is elementary school stuff.<br>
Every propagandist knows. Reality is something outside us, but shared by all of us, as default, and without any effort on our part. At almost zero cost zero effort. Our truth is our view on reality. (reality that remains unknown and unknowable to us.) The closer our truth is to reality, it's easier, cheaper, less effort to communicate that truth to all people.<br>
We see this in dictatorial regimes. The regime has to expend inordinate amount of effort to construct fantastical truths very far from reality. The reality everyone experiences for free by default. The regime has to spend a lot to maintain the fiction.<br>
The dude should think why he needs so much money and effort to be able to communicate his truth.<br>

Good on you criticising the government—but when are the @LibDems going to find their teeth? The country is not in a "business as usual" cca 2005 environment. Those days are gone. A multitude of crisis is washing over us. Inaction is not an option.<br>
From outside you look like bunch of toothless sandal wearing hippie OAPS tbh. And this is coming from a voter of yours! (hi @TweetingCollins) I understand this is not in the party DNA, but but—cometh the hour cometh the man. PM @Keir_Starmer is reinventing is premiership in real time, responding to events.<br>
Your party has chance to do better on housing, energy, industry, defence, AI—big issues of the day. Leasehold abolition is the easy win if ever were one for you—given no house builder lavishes their-ahem-"attentions" on your party. Your ideas still look stuck in the local gov potholes fixing. (not that I disparage that—it's needed and honest work, necessary but unfortunately not sufficient)<br>

Reality is something outside us, but shared by all of us, without as default, and without any effort on our part. At zero cost, at zero effort. The closer our side's truth, that is our side's view of that reality, (that shall remain forever unknown and unknowable to us,), the close that truth is to reality, it's easier, cheaper, less effort to communicate that truth to all of us humans.<br>
You see this in dictatorial regimes, where the regime has to expend inordinate amount of effort, to construct a truth completely detached from the reality everyone experiences for free by default. The regime has to spend a lot to maintain the fiction. And as time goes by, it's ever harder to band-aid the cracks appearing.<br>
You should think on, why you need so much money and effort to be able to communicate your truth to everyone.<br>

...are terminally stupid, *not* in the sense of they have low IQ or inability to to think rationally—no, their rational faculties are just fine. But it's that their morality system is deficient, they are immoral. What they think of good, the rest of us think as bad. And vice versa.<br>
So no amount of my explaining that helping Ukrainians fight their war and win, is going penetrate their shell of immorality. For the benefit of any other users that stumble on this thread this is what I have in mind-<br>

Anonymous account accusing others of virtue signalling. 😂 Only on the the Internet.<br>
I take virtue in preference to vice fwiw. Only—I'm not signalling. I am saying explicitly what I think. I'm not giving some mystery signals for others to decode in secret. The current Russia state ideology puts Russia on a trajectory towards "Russian army washing their boots in the English channel" as @KonstantinKisin rightly remarked.<br>
I have seen warring. It don't want to fight a war. And don't want my sons to fight one either. Ukraine war is not my war. Tbf to Ukrainians—none of them are asking us, to fight their war. (should anyone decide to, for ideas and ideals, are ofc welcome, and more power and glory to those brave souls; thanks for providing the link) Ukrainians are asking us, for 3 years now, to assist them with weapons. That's it! For us to produce and give them weapons, the more the better, so they themselves repel their invaders.<br>
Ukraine prevailing in their fight is in my interest. So helping them win is in my interest, in addition to being the right thing. For if Russia is to take over Ukraine, it will absorb the battle hardened Ukraine army. Then position their next dear leader in Belarus, after that human potato Lukashenka finally croaks. Then unite Russia + Ukraine + Belarus in a Greater Russia. Then they will make their next move West. And than the war will become if not mine, then my sons war. Even long before Russians get to "wash their boots in the English channel".<br>
Tbf my "coward" referred to your anonymity. Like putting words out, but without taking responsibility. Shielded by the invisibility cloak of anonymity. (c.f. Slashdot's "anonymous coward") I'm mystified by the level of cowardice, ngl. It's not like you are posting your opinions from Russia, so to be afraid of a flight from a 3-rd floor window or some such??<br>

I have come to think that the current AI, and the future hoped for ASI creation, is teaching us that compute transforming: data → information → knowledge → intelligence → agency → ... is all there is to it. All that ever was to it! Another bitter lesson. We just lacked ambition in scale.<br>
AI path opened now to AGI and latter ASI where previously we didn't see any for many decades. Seems foolish to me to frustrate, slow down, or even forego 2050s Intelligence Revolution that may times-it, by another x10-20x times, the total human wealth as value, the way the Industrial Revolution did in 1800s.<br>
Frustrate for what? So that we provide UBI to Disney shareholders?? That's even self-own by those better-off shareholders, given the opportunity cost! Every one of us is richer, better off, than any king of old. Louis XVI was in many many ways worse off than any one of us. (think dentistry-surgery-anaesthesia)<br>

Things that looked to me "inexplicable stupidity" became less inexplicable and more "ah, stupid—but I understand how and why" once I stumbled upon the follow-on to Cippola's definition of stupid (=="stupid is a person causing loss, pain, suffering to others, for no gain to himself, even at a small personal loss") by Bonhoeffer, that summarised is 1) stupidity is low morals not low IQ, it's thinking something is good, that rest of us find to be bad; and 2) it's social, like a mind virus (hi Elon) occurring in humans groups more than individuals.<br>

OP is making a claim about the *human brain*. You are replying with counter-claims about *universe and everything*.<br>
About the human brain: the neural networks, that are also known as parallel distributed processing (PDP), were explicitly modelled on and inspired by what we know about the human brain workings. Not by accident—but explicitly so. Lookup the "McCulloch-Pitts neuron (1943)". Here is McCulloch<br>

About the claim "Universe is a computer". I wouldn't go that far. I have personally come to think that information is the most fundamental thing in the universe. And that matter and energy are carriers of information. They in a sense are physical manifestations of information. I watched a lecture by a someone who is into quantum-this-and-that and the dude claimed exactly that - here<br>

That's a very very stupid request. For US will never risk nuclear annihilation for Poland. Putin can nuke Warsaw, and life in NewYork, Washington, San Francisco and Los Angeles will proceed just fine. Did Poland learn nothing from "security guarantees from powerful allies, but which are too far away to help much in time, so not really deterring your enemies" already? (khmkhm1939)<br>
Only way this is not stupid is to get a clear NO from US. That way a possible obstacle on the path to Poland + Nordics + Baltics developing their own nuclear deterrent is removed. For anything else but very own deterrent is not deterrent. Putin is not deterred from attacking Poland by fear of US. As he doubts—as any reasonable person would doubt—that US will risk nuclear war for Poland. (or any other country for that matter.)<br>

I like this aspect of libertarian framing of taxes and public spending: I am taking from someone at the point of the gun. I the government, using my monopoly on violence (ultimately—death), take from someone by force. Something they would rather use to feed their kids. It's not like they give it to me voluntarily, on their own volition. I take it by force. So I have extra special obligation there. What I take, to not be wasted. What I take, to be spent better, than that person would have spent it themselves.<br>
That's quite a high bar. It pains me to read otherwise reasonable people, and or friends, when they say "ah it's only 100M p.a; ah it's just a rounding error."<br>
I think—how much tax did you pay last year? Did you pay 20K say? Ok 20K. Can you imagine how much easier your life would be, if you had those extra 20K available to you? Like—everything stays the same, everything those taxes otherwise buy—in most general sense that's most of the the modern world—nothing changes there. The only change is—you got those 20K extra discretionary spending power at your disposal. Now think conversely—how much grief (if not hardship) lacking those 20K caused you.<br>
Now—everything you though and felt, imagine it's 5000 people, not only yourself. That's the 100M p.a. Chagos. 5000 People like yourself. That's a small town, esp if you scale to be 1-in-household. It's not nothing. Much sweat (if not tears) is spent to gain much less than that.<br>

MAD desired not real outcome—ofc, but I find it "a distinction without difference". This is something about the future, can't be otherwise.<br>
The "destruction" part—I'd say, it depends. If Nordics + Poland + Baltics join forces, and build enough devices and big ones. (fusion in addition to fission.) I recall the Annie Jacobsen book and e.g. this interview<br>
<p><br>
<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=GXgGR8KxFao">https://youtube.com/watch?v=GXgGR8KxFao</a><br>
about the destructive power of modern atomic devices. So that may go towards "assured" in MAD.<br>
But sure there are plenty of references (thanks @grok!) to "survivability, 2nd strike, achieving favourable outcome" and similar, to support the thesis "US/Russia think they can win a nuclear war" too.<br>

Is there data or any measurements on measures of the faculties for communication and or empathy, over the same period?<br>
Human intelligence is collective, not individual. Our head meat-space, needs to be allocated between 1) Individual unit supporting faculties - memory, computation; and 2) Collective group supporting faculties - communication, empathy.<br>
Maybe lately the culture is shifting more towards group faculties, at the expense of the individual ones? Any possible change can only be culture, can't be straight meat-space.<br>
This is not the first time, no? Afaik Neanderthals had bigger cranium than Sapiens. Reasonable to assume that individually in problem solving or reasoning, avg Neanderthal wd better the avg Sapiens? Yet—Neanderthals were out-competed by the Sapiens to extinction.<br>

My personal prejudice is this.<br>
Human intelligence is collective, not individual. Our head meat-space, needs to be allocated between 1) Individual unit supporting faculties - memory, computation; and 2) Collective group supporting faculties - communication, empathy.<br>
To test this hypothesis, one would seek data on some measures of the faculties for communication and or empathy, over the same period.<br>

If it makes you feel better—human stupidity is also collective. This is as good a day as any to share a most excellent @skdh episode on the topic-<br>

Eh—"one causing harm, loss and pain to othesr, for no personal gain, even at a small loss, is said to act stupid; stupidity is not low IQ or lacking rational faculties, but lacking morals; thinking of something bad as being good; it's also more a collective phenomenon than and individual one, a mind virus".

If true—and IK we are unlikely to learn any time soon beyond balance-of-probability type judgement call—and given no-one was punished, both for the initial crime and especially the subsequent coverup, presumably the next Covid, say Covid-29, is being cooked in BSL-x labs as we are writing this.<br>
Ngl imo at this point only Nuremberg-style trials will do. To drill into the thick thick skulls of the politicians and bureaucrats and—the most disappointig of all!—scientists, in power and yet to come, a healthy fear from the wrath of a revolting public.<br>
While accidents do happen, this particular lab leaking was not unexpected. The "I'm The Science" cabal in positions of power betrayed us, abused our trust. They said one thing in public, then said  opposite things in private between themselves. They conspired like mafiosi. Punishment is warranted.<br>

Hm, for me RealRameSurname, or NickButPersistenInTime accounts seem like a reasonable proxy for "a real human, with real name or genuine anon" filter for the time being?<br>
But yeah—I'm surprised how blaze X has been refusing to give us tools (not solving the problem themselves—just giving us humans tools!) to curate our own feeds?<br>
Doubly surprised, b/c 1) Once us humans in a distributed manner do initial pass on filtering, X can train models; and 2) Bots don't have bank accounts, they will hurt X $$$ ultimately. Even if short-term bots may boost human engagement, humans learn about the bots, then disengage.<br>

Neither am I. I got and like my roof solar and battery. The self-use is about 40%. (with extra battery may get to 50%-considering...) That's average, over the year, with extremes - worst in winter 0%, best in summer 100%.<br>
It was a good learning experience too. I refreshed my EE-knowledge: 1) Everything that is consumed must be produced, supply matching demand, not on average over a day or an hour—but every moment every second of every day. 2) Go reminded to mind my difference between - a kWh of energy, from a MW of power. And 3) the fun with the "three phases" of electricity.<br>
Having said that. Instead of pocketing their victory and moving on with their lives, the Puritan NetZero Taliban seem hell bent on destroying us and destroying their achievement too in the process it seems?? For every subsequent halving of what remains, costs about as much as all the prior investment up to that point.<br>

Saw it was "Everything is a computer" appreciation day yesterday. People chiming out of their cuckoo clocks, announcing a transition away from the mechanistic universe. TBS if one-off before retreating back to the safety of their mechanistic toys, or a wider mind shift—a new meme finally taking hold of our heads.<br>
Atm computer and computing is the best abstraction we got at our disposal. Computer is the latest-greatest, most powerful. Ofc we should use it. It would be silly not to.<br>
I can see how and why we people object to changing metaphors: "The wheel" → "The word" → "Mechanical clock" → "Computer." But to my mind—doh, of course we update our model of the world around us. (NB: We're talking about our model of the world, not the world itself. Good to keep a bit of distance at all times, not get too uppity; it keeps us on our toes.) Would we prefer we didn't? My only objection is it takes us an awfully long time, tbh! (pic with chronology)<br>
Everything is best abstracted by the most powerful machine we have at our disposal at any given time. (like using a bigger model that fits better.) A computer is a better abstraction than a mechanical clock for the Universe. The mechanical clock was better than "The word," and "The word" was better than "The wheel." That’s presumably why we switch—each new abstraction serves us better. It's not a slight on humanity—it's the ok thing to do.<br>
I would dearly like to know what comes after the computer? (even if already privileged to see the "everything is computer" in my lifetime.) Yeah "we made sand think" is much joy and fun, but nagging suspicion "The computer" will soon be shown inadequate. For that process of humanity fitting ever bigger and better model to the world around us, while still falling short too, is also telling us: the world around us is still more powerful! (and interesting.)<br>

I can't, sorry. There is not one single way afaik. There was rarely complete language support that solves all issues completely in the past. Maybe things are better now. In absence of complete language, database etc support everywhere, one fallbacks to self-discipline.<br>
Personally, I got a rule to have in the name of a datetime type variable some indication, say _UTC or _Local, to indicate to the reader, (probably future me,) that I have thought about the TZ issue. And what I decided, what's the resolution, what kind of datetime is in that variable.<br>
If it's not indicated, I'd assume UTC. But maybe also a code smell, that the code writer didn't consider the TZ. If _Local, then I have to find a way to carry the info to what location of that locality is. To record the "Europe/London" elsewhere in some way. If _UTC, then there is no need for that.<br>
My point was that I've found that I it's useless to record BST or GMT as that is almost never needed. Ofc, one can convert from "Europe/London", and map that to "BST" (1/2 of the year, when we have DST in force), or "GMT" (the other 1/2 of the year, when we have regular time or winter time without DST). But my point is-we almost never care about that the timezone. Usually, it's either "UTC", or "local" and what "location" it is at.<br>

Tbh on their recent track records, Oxford PhD economics grad, and executive director at Goldman Sachs, is as much a disqualifier, as it is a qualifier. The attributes indicate a person energetic and capable—yes. But for doing things bad as well as for doing things good. I have to admit without any joy of seeing it that way. (even a tinge of sadness.) Carney was not a great success as a BoE governor.<br>

Yes, sort of. We need both. Choice looks orthogonal to certainty to me.<br>
We need certainty to survive. To keep on living—we need air and heath every second, food and water every day. We need certainty. Too much uncertainty there kills us, we can only tolerate a limited amount of uncertainty there.<br>
But we need choice to develop, for there to be something rather than nothing in the first place. That is needed upstream from us. That choice is what ultimately makes it possible for us to be born in the first place.<br>

Absolutely. Everything is a computer. Information theory is the most general theory we got. Knowledge is a p.d.f. Learning is acquiring a p.d.f. where previously we lacked one. Figuring out what, and how many of it. Computing is taking our knowledge, the learned p.d.f.s we got, and manipulating those p.d.f.s by either marginalisation, or conditioning, to create new p.d.f.s. These new p.d.f.s then tell us something about what what we care about but we can't observe, having observed things that are easy for us to observe, but we don't care about.<br>

Thanks, interesting, will read. To my mind, knowledge is specifying a probability density function p.d.f.  A re-normalised histogram of qualities, where we count which ones, and how many of which one. And quality is one dimension out of N in an N-dimensional vector space.<br>

I meant: we are used to e.g. N=3, where we get data points in the middle. There centrality measures as representative single value as a proxy for the distribution makes sense.<br>
But for high-N, in that average central middle, there are not many points. Nothing in the centre is representative of the distribution. But we still compute the centre and treat it as if it's a representative value for the distribution.<br>
The analogy in 2D would be—say we have a bi-modal pdf, with two distinct but about equal mass bumps, some distance from each other. We compute the mean as a representative value. It falls right between the two bumps. So a very improbable value. Yet—we still treat that mean as a representative value for the pdf.<br>

It's silly DOGE concentrated on the least important stuff (saving some $$$, of which USG is never short off-that's what the deficit is for, and is inconsequential). Too bad Musk is a cretin when it comes to gov-anything, basically in a "Your country is not a company"-way.<br>

Normies think they are replying to a computer, to a machine, not to another human. They feel nothing about the other side. Like talking to their oven-silly, right? From PoV on the other/receiving side, that way to relate comes over as rude. Even if I know it's unintentionally so.<br>
Nerds know but also feel, that there is a human on the other side. Treat the conversation like conversing with a real human on the other side. (modulo the role the medium plays; latency expectations e.g. voice-now, sms-10 min, chat-1 hour, email-1 day.) Further  human they know, not a random stranger. If they are rude-it's intentional.<br>
Older techies are like the nerds, but barely anyone pre-Xgen. Even my mum thinks she is messaging a computer, not myself, her son of 50+ years. :-)<br>

The politicians not only don't fear the wrath of the public. They hold us the public in contempt.<br>
Lying mercilessly to the public and in industrial quantities used to be  the Soviet Union playbook. Now it seems that cancer has spread West. Something more radical needed to concentrate the minds of politicians and civil servants. They lack fear of God anymore, with all of us not believing the white bearded Santa in the skies anymore. But they must be made to fear what comes after they stop being in power, if they are to transgress. Atm they are not punished. So they will continue with more of the same.<br>

Hey, recently I saw this nugget. And I know it's unwise to use the H-word online. But this seems to be a genuine historic record.<br>
@ 16' by the excellent @TimothyDSnyder, in "A Speech to Europe 2019", the "Ecological panic" (tc in link) -<br>
<p><br>
<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=7zs41CkIjRw&t=960s">https://youtube.com/watch?v=7zs41CkIjRw&t=960s</a><br>
"... Ecological Panic. Hitler's argument for why Germany had to seize what they needed before others could. Hitler said specifically that science and technology will not rescue us, we must take from others. Ecological panic. The second overall cause of the Holocaust is dehumanisation. The idea that since we must take from others, others are only valuable in so far as they can serve us".<br>
Now the speaker was using this as an argument for more panic imo. Of the type of "the world is falling/burning/crashing/drowning" which I did not quite understand. Like-surely the message should be exactly the opposite. Don't do a-hitler. Don't scare people Savanarola-style with end-of-world prophesies.<br>
We have had the experience of the last 80 yrs, where the world warmed up at a rate of 1.2C/century. So we should not be complacent, but neither should we lose our heads in panic. Imo the message should have been: Do encourage people to use their rational faculties. Do not give up on the idea of technology will rescue us. In fact-little else in history has rescued us from the predicaments of the human condition, but technology. So-maybe even double down on technology! To lead us out of the valley of tears.<br>

Like for Auckland, use "Pacific/Auckland" explicitly, is what I'm saying. Don't try to use NZDT, NZST or similar. If you are interested about time in Auckland, use "Pacific/Auckland". I'm not saying use UTC-I'm saying forget about messing with NZST NZDT DST UTC all that stuff, just use "Pacific/Auckland". B/c that's what users ever care about, and it's easily available.<br>

Ofc. What other better abstraction we got at our disposal atm? Computer is the latest-greatest, most powerful. Ofc we are to use it.<br>
Everything can be best abstracted with the most powerful machine we got at any given time. (like a bigger model that can be made to fit better.) Computer is a better abstraction then a mechanical clock for the Universe. And mechanical clock was better than "the word". And "the word" was better than "the wheel". So what comes after the computer, will improve on that. It's not a slight on humanity-it's the reasonable thing to do.<br>
And yet and yet-it's still inadequate, right? So that process of humanity fitting ever bigger and better model to the world around us, while still falling short of perfection, is also telling us: the world around us is more powerful! (still!?)<br>

The politicians not only don't fear the wrath of the public. They hold us the public in contempt.<br>
Lying mercilessly to the public and in industrial quantities used to be  the Soviet Union playbook. Now it seems that cancer has spread West. Something more radical needed to concentrate the minds of politicians and civil servants. They lack fear of God anymore, with all of us not believing the white bearded Santa in the skies anymore. But they must be made to fear what comes after they stop being in power, if they are to transgress. Atm they are not punished. So they will continue with more of the same.<br>

Doubt it will get to agreeing even the 30 days. More likely, Russia will come back with some condition, like "Zelensky is to resign", or "Ukraine to disband half the army", as a pre-condition to cease-fire.<br>
Remember: always demand everything, don't ask, demand. Do not back down. If you persevere long enough, there will always appear someone, on the other side, that will give you 1/2, or 1/4, of what you demand. Then you will end up pocketing that 1/2 or 1/4, even before any negotiations start.<br>
That's how you end up with the largest land mass in the whole world, as your country. Always demand more. Do not ask-demand. Sounds crazy (to aim for more land), but also reasonable (if you only care about the land and nothing else).<br>

That maybe, but it's not the only thing.<br>
Those around him see strong USD a benefiting Wall Street, but disbenefiting re-industrialisation. Weaker USD is also part of the plan. Also "Trump crazy"-sell-US/D is a factor pushing in the direction of the plan.<br>
Same reason they got nothing against the USG backed crypto scheme. Say USG had a USD 1:1 backed stable coin. (USC? USN?) Then foreigners holding USD outside of the US (another factor pushing for US budget deficits), can be incentivised to sells USD buy USN (the USG coin), thus pushing for lower fx for USD. (also easing pressure on USG budget deficit)<br>
And of course weaker USD makes imports more expensive, reduces imports. And the usual risk of importing inflation via importing more expensive energy is mitigate by US being largely energy self-sufficient. (even exporting)<br>

It's unfortunate that our intuition about how the space fills, that we build on examples from our physical world where N=2 or N=3, is not only inadequate, but outright deceptive to us. Those things for high-N, stand exactly the opposite, to how they are, for low-N. Various measures of centrality, that we think of as representative, are actually not representing what we hope they are.<br>
In N-dimensional space, for sufficiently large N, every N-point, is an outlier. In that N-space, the space moves in the corners. There is little space left in the centre. We know this from seeing the ratio of N-ball to N-cube N-volume measures drop quickly towards zero with increasing N.<br>

Sure, but "no benign" does not equal "end of the world with 100% certainty by year 2125". Further, the logic connecting the outcome to the present actions via the the "precautionary principle" is just that, a general "principle", a guide, a "rule of thumb".<br>
Using the same principle and "no benign" and the same weak logic I can just about justify everything. People just use that to propose "solutions" that solve nothing. That are their favourite hobby horses that do not solve whatever problem they have in mind. That's a poor way to lead. The elite should not be putting personal whims as a top priority.<br>
And in the process, re-running a chain similar to hitlerian 1-2-3 Lebensraum ecological panic logic outlined in the TDS speech. Now re-reading the chain, I see even "the ends justify the means". That should trigger alarm bells in us, strikes me being a bad idea. For ends that are in the future, "I beseech you think it possible you may be mistaken" always comes to my mind.<br>
UK we run the experiment of decarbonising our electricity grid in the past 15yrs. The results are in. Households and businesses have had their bills triple. Imo that's a major factor in being on track to elect as PM our very own Trump-like caesar in 3 years time. There is no country in the world that is both rich, and does not use much energy.<br>
UK could have done what France did half a century ago and decarbonised electricity with nuclear. Proven technology, cheaper than our current one, works without question, zero carbon. But, when choosing between a solution, and a hobby horse, our innumerate leaders went for the fashion of the day.<br>
Wind and solar are expensive when the need to be 100% reliable is factored in. Hence the need for subsidies etc. I have rooftop solar + batteries myself, know my kWh energy from MW power, know that national grid needs to balance every second of every day. There is not one country in the whole world, with *both* significant wind+solar *and* cheap electric energy. Not one.<br>
(side note: I see you are using Grok to expand your thinking, and I commend that; you may want to check magisterial @karpathy tutorials on "how should I think about these things given how they work under the hood" aimed any non-specialist us, this https://youtube.com/watch?v=7xTGNNLPyMI and the next one too; they are long but worth it and can be watched in start-pause instalments)<br>

Yes but the non-linear tipping points are the hardest to predict so while certainly they are not impossible—it's impossible to forecast them with any accuracy. In the end forecasting ends up equivalent to "8B will die, therefore anything I want done is moral imperative we should do it no questions asked".<br>
The idea "no benign warming" invites "benign to whom?" Obviously Earth had periods with higher CO2 and higher temperature and plenty of life on Earth. The fossil fuels we are digging out and whose CO2 we are returning back into the atmosphere by burning them—come from such high CO2 periods.<br>
IMO when forecasting the more prudent, the less exciting, the more accurate. I'd stick to the IPCC reports about possible consequence. Tipping points etc are low probability high consequence events similar to asteroid hitting Earth, nuclear war etc. About zero confidence of accuracy of such forecasts tbh. I do forecasting for a living so got some appreciation of the challenges for these specific types of future events.<br>

Bad morals, not low IQ. Bad moral values. Think of the absent father situation of all these remote-conception children. What does a kid want and need most from a parent? Love. How is love communicated? By spending time with them, giving them our time. In a way—our time & attention is the most sincere gift to give. How much time & attention can a father give to ~20 remote children while running all these companies, and now even government? Not much—is my prejudice.<br>

We have had 1.2C-per-100-years degrees warming in the past 80yrs, and we are not dead yet. So yeah—various bad things may happen in the future, but also it's possible they will not. Our world now is better in many ways to the world 80yrs ago when I look at the Our World In Data collected stats.<br>
For all the catastrophists I think—have you considered that your forecast about the future maybe wrong? What is the cost then? Assuming 8B billion will be dead is a very comfortable position to be in for the person making the claim. Because then—anything is justified.<br>
Not just justified—but a moral imperative. Murder 4B in order to save 4B Thanos style? Justified—but notice how it hinges on being 100% correct forecast about the future. And future by definition can never be forecast by 100% certainty. So no—I'm not in favour of that kind of thinking, sorry.<br>

Thanks for that! Interesting so far - but will have to listen again. (oow-now Leszek Kolakowski quote in the end; loved "Heavens' keys" and "Conversations With the Devil" ages ago)<br>
Have all the time in the world for @TimothyDSnyder. Read "Bloodlands" and liked it. Listening to his speech, I thought "Hitler's Empire" was his, but suspecting "is it?" and checking now I find and also remembered it's by Mark Mazower. (also recommend)<br>
Had forgotten about The Third Reich being an empire, but of course it was. In his speech, noticed this - 1) Hitler expanded the Lebensraum b/c of ecological panic 2) Ecology was bad and science and technology was not going to solve it; so 3) Germans had to take from others.<br>
So while agree with his view. In my mind, his historic lesson additionally resonated additionally with this: by creating an ecological panic around global warming, the more quasi-religious fringes of the modern ecological movements that reject any hint of technological solution and adaptation are "history riming not repeating". For the cost of their "solutions" that don't actually solve anything, is driving the voters in the warm bosoms of the Caesars TDS rightly badmouths and fears.<br>

Ah, you mean following 4K accounts is too many. Yes I agree. It happens this way.<br>
When I think something is worth forwarding, I typically click Follow this account. My thinking is - if they wrote something I found worth enough to forward, it was something interesting to me, and if they did it in the past, maybe they will do it in the future.<br>
Now, most of the time that does not pan out. So I'd have to go through the list, and Unfollow some past accounts. And I do from time to time, open the list of Follows, and ask myself "do I recall this account, do I remember reading something interesting", and where the answer is No, I Unfollow.<br>
However, it's a chore, uninteresting manual labour, so not done very often. Plus, I noticed that X Algofeed has become more atuned to my interests. So out of 100 accounts, the algofeed will show me posts from 30 that interest me. I don't have to unfollow the other 70 to tell the algofeed "don't show me their posts".<br>
I only have to keep curating the say 5-10 out of 100 that I disagree with, annoy me, or I would not willingly chose to read as they are less than pleasant to my current thinking, but still interesting from some angle from my PoV. The 5-10% of disagreeable content one is to let in the own bubble to be able to change with times and avoid being totally closed chamber. (and end insane)<br>

Researching the past is better than not researching, but it means little. Certainly less than people assume.<br>
In the future: 1) Your FH may turn decide to extort you, where they didn't in the past; 2) The MA they appoint may change, start extorting you; 3) The FH may change too! (the freehold maybe sold)<br>
So the cries of "Buyer beware" are not the silver bullet many hope they will be. Better to tell the buyer upfront: someone else will be writing the bills, and you will be paying them. Or else...<br>

Thanks! Oh yes please feel free to throw back some references at me. Recently I became aware of existence of Karl Friston theories after watching a podcast. As far as ML parts go—all he said about the mechanisms, all that has "probability density" in there, makes perfect send to me.<br>
I have been told "the joint probability density function between two variables X and Y captures everything that there is ever to be known about the relation between those X and Y" 25 years ago by a friend, and have been thinking on those terms ever since.

Well—if in the real world, which is a gigantic organism of its own, it's of benefit for distributed network of independent things to exists, rather than one single blob, then: it should not be improbable, for the same to be true for thy way our brain works. For there to be an advantage, to for the brain to be architected as collection of semi-independent agents, that work independently, on their own, and then at the end one collects and collates the final result. Call that one final agent node—our conscious self. There—mystery solved. 😂 joke, joke (about solved)—but not out of mind crazy, no?<br>

I can not comprehend how random SV person worth >$100M can complain muh-no-FU-muh. The idea is not that speaking your mind costs 0. The idea is that there is monetary $$$ cost to speaking the truth in the company of liars—but you can take the hit! That's what FU money is for. To absorb that hit. For that hit to not delete you. You still live another day, you can still speak your mind.<br>
The SV dudes strike me as clutching their pearls too tightly. Let go of those pearly $$$ - that's what they are for. To buy you that freedom—to speak you mind.<br>
Of course that doesn't say anything much about the ideas spoken—only that the ideas are unpopular, ostracised. But doesn't say if the ideas are good or bad, clever or stupid, interesting or boring. That would be asking too much of a simple device that FU money is, tbh.<br>

I think European's paranoia comes from their position of weakness. Europeans genuinely lack their own weapons for their own defence. A generation of feeble, dunder-headed, low-energy leaders exposed their citizens to a number of risks—energy, defence, etc. Only France has done it right. Poland, the Nordics, Germany—they need not only conventional weapons, but their own nuclear deterrent too. I can't imagine US going to nuclear exchange with Russia, if Russia were to nuke Warsaw. And if I can't—I imagine plenty of others can't too, including plenty in Russia. Once deterrent is not credible—it's not a deterrent any more, there is none.<br>

I'm of course ignorant to any non-public information. IDK what the current issues are, what the disagreements are.<br>
To me Ukraine insisting on "security guarantees" (whatever that is) seems silly. Anything signed on paper at present, only weakly binds anyone in the future anyway. And especially with a "might is right", "what cards you got to play" Trump-like admin/president/party. Ukr can do as Putin does: sign whatever, then do whatever you want anyway, regardless of what's signed.<br>
Obviously Russia could just pause attacking, starting tonight, and peace will arrive. But reasoning from first principles: Putin is safe and sound while Russia is at war. So I don't see why Putin would be stopping this war. Or any war.<br>
Publicly I see zero US pressure on Russia to stop. And pressure on Ukraine is implicit encouragement to Russia to keep up with the attacks and keep the war going imo.<br>

Support for Ukraine, and possibly Europe, is in the past. Before MAGA run the US. That was a different US it seems to me.<br>
After all—if US decides to extort UK with "give me X or your planes will not fly", what cards does UK hold? Don't see many.<br>

Yes both sides are apart, and drifting further away fast.<br>
Similar the way Americans think "lack of appreciation, no `thank you`-s", Europeans think "Russia will be bombing our cities and Americans will be at best standing neutral, at worst helping Russia outright".<br>
I read of US effectively disabling F16-s donated to Ukraine by European countries. I though at once—they could do the same to the UK, (where I live) while we are under attack of Russian rockets. This is not something you'd think and worry about.<br>
It's not trivial putting oneself in others shoes and getting their PoV. Airing disagreements in public is the surest way to amplify them.<br>

🤣 haha - v.funny! @ LJ: explain difference between private and public debt.<br>
LJ: in the real world where some of us lived and traded through GFC'08, and have memory longer than of a gold fish, the 2008 crisis happened b/c private debt. Private, not public.<br>
Private loans given by private banks and shadow banking institutions to private borrowers went bad. Mostly predictably b/c they were bad loans to not credit-worthy borrowers. The oldest story in the book. The subsequent contagion when no-one could tell which bank is going to stand and which is going to fall, caused most of the banking sector to effectively go bust.<br>
And looked like "this sucker is going down" (GWB) taking with it the real economy too. Step in the public bailing out private banking and other private industries with guarantees, loans, bailouts etc.  In summary, it was private, not public debt, that went bad.<br>
I like Dalio and recommend his "How the Economic Machine Works" animated 20 min movie as it's really good about the mechanics of markets and role of debt. But as with many financiers, he too, despite all his radical transparency self-critique maoist BS, has somewhat self-serving blind spot when ti comes to private/public debt differences.<br>

Ah—the never ending tug-of-war in this. For there are 2 sides to the issue. So there will always be someone grasping one end, and making some hay out of it, while ignoring the other end.<br>
The opposing camps are forever telling only 1/2 of the story. The complete story is: 99.9% alternative new upstart etc ideas turn out to be wrong. However, there is 0.1% where what a maverick proposes turns out right. And that 0.1% make account for, the 100% of the new significant breakthroughs.<br>

Why? I can think of—<br>
1) Unaccountability Machine. Avoid accountability while still wielding most of the power. Plausible deniability. Can outsource to them things I'm pressured to do, should do, is the right thing to do, but I the minister don't want to do. (for whatever reason)<br>
2) Cronyism, corruption. Bungs for in-group I-scratch-your-back-you-mine, friends, even family, soft over the table corruption conveyor belt. Especially when further institutionalised and commercialised via NGO Limited companies. (can imagine further step—corporatisation and financialization, haha 😄)<br>
3) Blair trying to get things done. The civil service and bureaucracy will frustrate a reformer. Quick solution—build alternative structures, devolve power to them, fill them with energetic acolytes. Will get things done short term. Trouble is—without any feedback loop whatsoever, this system veers off course pretty quick.<br>

If UK needed to launch our own satellite independently, would we be able to? Like France did yesterday. If UK needed targeting data b/c Russia decided to teach us a lesson. Would UK be able to operate our own jets, when US decides to shutdown support like with European F16-s donated to Ukraine? If France-launches-military-satellites-in-space-but-UK-unable parochial competition does not spur UK into action towards more independent minded security, IDK what will. 😆 Kind of hopium that after 1939-41 and Suez, UK was—"yeah we can rely on US just fine".<br>

Yes, true. But nothing lasts forever. It's the end of the post WW2 ordering, where USA (claimed) to be prepared to wage nuclear war against the Soviet Union invading (West) Germany and France, and the SU believed that US claim.<br>
Now Germany and Poland will need to get their own nuclear deterrent. One way or another. That's ultimately the only protection against Russia invasion. For in a war between nuclear and non-nuclear state, the nuclear can only draw or win, and the non-nuclear can only draw or lose. So a nuclear state once it shifts into predatory mode (Russia Putin imperial, US Trump transactional) will act on that obvious incentive.<br>
Yes, that increases some risks. Nuclear Armageddon remains one of the two major risks. (the other one—much worse covid like world wide pandemic)<br>

Noticed half-dozen examples of a pattern: 1) USG claims C on some topic [2) presume Musk trusts USG] 3) turns out USG claim C was wrong, even deliberate lie 4) Musk conclusion: "whatever USG says on the topic, multiply by -1". But that's wrong. If I don't trust USG, my correlation to their claims should be 0, not -1. Or rather, when assessing probability of a claim C, should be P(C)=P(C|USG opined on C). I distrust USG, so it opining on C changes not at all my belief about C.<br>

Fwiw I think Poland acquiring nuclear deterrent reduces the probability of nuclear war. If they do it-that is. (thus far Europeans lacked will even if the writing was on the wall for some time.)<br>
Scenario. Lacking deterrent, emboldened Greater Russia 1st invades the Baltics. US huffs and puffs, but  does nothing much. Then, by now reckless drunk on success, Russia invades Poland too.<br>
At this point US gets involved. A hot war between Russia and US starts that way. It may end in nuclear exchange.<br>

Exactly this. Elites got into their heads the idea that general public are imbeciles who can't hold more than a single idea in their heads. So it has to be either 100% good, or 100% bad. (for reasons more self-serving than usually admitted)<br>
Now, of course the average person is not a rocket scientist. (and half are dumber than that) Still, they can hold the idea that there are pros- and cons- both to interventions, and to doing nothing. The average person can handle the idea of gives-and-takes just fine.<br>
We know this for sure. Because people already do that with any number of things. And for things that really do matter to them, and where large enough group of people are informed, even if a majority are uninformed, groups regularly do great. (The Wisdom of Crowds) All it takes is for the ignorant to decide independently, and their errors will cancel out.<br>
When they don't decide independently, but follow each others, errors are all one sided and don't cancel out. Then we have collective stupidity overwhelm collective intelligence. (Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds)<br>

Quite the story there! Also details<br>
> A message sent by Marsalek to fellow spy Orlin Roussev - who ran the UK-based group from a former guest house in Norfolk - demonstrated inside knowledge of Putin's thinking. He wrote: "Personally I find Grozev not to be a very valuable target but apparently Putin seriously hates him."<br>

He is "stupid". On the Cippola meaning of stupid: stupid person causes loss, pain, suffering to others, for no gain to himself, even a small loss. His stupidity comes not from low IQ or especially lacking rational faculties, but from lack of morals. Or a different set of morals<br>

Humans are quite shite in many areas. Mostly ones in position to measure and give feedback are not incentivised enough to do so. So they they don't.<br>
Again and again we find that people have inflated sense of their abilities. Answers to questions like "could you wrestle a bear", or "could you win a game of tennis against Serena Williams" etc. (there's is a positive there that people try even at low odds, and sometimes get lucky)<br>

Of course.<br>
Even in the 1990s, immediately after becoming free again, (with the withdrawal of the Soviet Union armies,) they were talking "either in NATO, or we develop own detterence". That was "their card", and Clinton having some US State he needed to win in elections with a large Polish diaspora.<br>
People speaking now as if NATO wanted to expand are delusional. In fact, the existing members refused to admit new countries. And especially US was reluctant. Only after badgering and pleading for a few years, and with US fearing nuclear proliferation, were the Central and East European countries admitted to NATO.<br>
Now no one in Europe thinks US will fight Russia and risk nuclear Armageddon when Russia invades the Baltics, and then Poland. Or any country in Europe.<br>
People talking as if Art.5 is some magic weapon shielding them form Russia assault. It's a single word. Members promise they will "help" when one of them is attacked. That's it, one word, "help".<br>
So Poland, Finland, the Baltics, the Nordica, ofc need their own detterence. Germany too. They should have started thinking about it the 1st time Trump was elected. And started working on them for sure since Feb-2022.<br>
Europeans had a generation of lazy, feeble minded, entitled leaders. If not outright foreign aligned agents as leaders. (khmMerkelkhm) But now it's clear to all. They need to be able to defend themselves from Russia alone. Possibly even with US allayed with Russia against Europe.<br>

Ego. "I", and "the-world-ex-I", have not separated. As babies we can't make distinction between "I" and "everything-else-ex-I" initially, it's all the same to us. Then, in time, we learn of the separation. (can say that-death is the maximum of that.) But narcissists don't learn.<br>

Exactly! It's pointless asking any promises of Trump. As his admin will simply not deliver on them.<br>
IMO Ukraine should do the same as Trump and Putin do: sign whatever in bad/no faith. Then mostly ignore, or not, whichever way is opportune to advance their own strength.<br>
Trump doesn't care either way. As long as there is PR news story out there to be told. Putin will do as before, whatever is signed, and continue working on taking over Ukraine. Ukraine lose nothing, if they are bound by nothing. They win getting Trump off their backs.<br>

The part of leftism you intuitively feel is right but you don't articulate  is the "slave morality" we all get from Christianity: to suffer is ok, even good. And for the few real beleviers-even virtuous.<br>
It is indeed a successful organising principle. For in the group dynamics, 90% is cooperation, and only 9% is competition. And in that 9% of activity where we complete, there will be few winners, and many losers.<br>
So indeed to alienate the many, for the benefit of few, is indeed bonkers, it is stupid. For the benefit of the few that are already the winners. 🏆 Winners already get societal prizes like goods, money, get attention, sex, etc - whatever we humans crave.<br>
And are denied only one single piece. A symbolic thing, a gold star, ⭐ a medal🥇 of no real practical consequence: being called "good". Rather- that symbolic prize is awared to the losers. The losers, that let us remember, got nothing else.<br>
Every once in a while, an elite comes along, that is so narcissistic, so insecure, so craven, so ill adjusted, so unaware of this setup-that can't take that symbolic loss. Being denied the designation "good".<br>
So in a monster toddler tantrum, the narcissist elite decide to torch everything, burn everything down. Flip the morals, so "winning is good and virtuous", losing is bad, and now the "good" boy gold 🪙 star is to belong to them. In the process,<br>
to flip to "master morality", they have to tear down the institutions, destroy the government, abolish governance.<br>
We are in that moment now. Musk is the face of the toddler acting the monster tantrum irl.<br>

Russia love of Moscow Mule Muskians looks the weak bet there. Russia not Soviet Union. Is 1/2 SU in people and territory. Lacking universalist ideology. (SU communism discredited only late, asset for long time) Produces nothing of value sought by any neighbour. (like Saudi Arabia.) Hydrocarbons an asset, but ever less so. Between Russia energy and not being killed by Russia, most opt for the latter. Alternatives be sought and found. Make do with less. It's not forever. Stone age didn't end for lack of stones.<br>
Central-East Europe stronger now than in 1939-1945, should resist Russia Orc. Inspired by Ukraine "give me freedom of give me death" stand. Germany and France both on the same Europe side.<br>

Yeah—with the persons like @ MsMarkievitz, I have learned<br>
1) They are "stupid" on Cippola's definition of stupidity—"with their actions stupid person will cause great harm and pain to others, while deriving no gain for themselves, even at a small personal loss".<br>
2) This is *not* low IQ or lack of rational faculties! (to be fair to the minority unfortunate retarded people that have genuine hardware faults.) If interested for more—look up Bonhoeffer.<br>
3) The root cause of stupidity is morals. These people lack morals. What they think is good, the rest of us think it bad. (and vice versa)<br>
Or one can even say: they have a different moral code.<br>
Our currently prevalent moral code is "slave morality": Christianity-based moral code, where to suffer is virtuous and to be poor and powerless is not a sin. It's even good.<br>
Alternative moral code would be pagan and e.g. Roman "master morality": to be powerful is good, to be powerless is bad. Poor and feeble deserve their fate, for they are bad people. The ones with power are good people. (might is right)<br>
4) It's a social phenomenon mostly, a "mind virus" even.<br>

On the contrary—I have seen wars, I don't want to fight wars, I don't want my sons to fight wars.<br>
One side not wanting a war is not sufficient for avoiding war, unfortunately. If it were, there would have been World Peace upon us already.<br>
So the 2nd best option to deter the side that is preparing to attack you, or talking about attacking you—by arming yourself to the teeth. Russia is attacking Europe and UK daily already. In their minds they are already at war with the UK.<br>
In that scenario, re-building Europe armies is the way to deter. (maybe) Conventional armies for sure. Even if 3 years late. And Europe needs to expand the nuclear arsenal too. Poland + Baltics + Nordics need to get independent nuclear deterrent imo.<br>
Putin—and his successor—will likely 1) absorb Ukraine, esp the battle hardened army; 2) position pro-Kremlin president of Belarus (after Lukashenka croaks); 3) have Greater Russia uniting all (incl Moldova); 4) likely invade the Baltics (alt: Romania, Bulgaria—if political opening there)<br>

Да, вреди дали се секираш и за таа варијанта. Еве предложи што tribute, што е нешто што Путин сака или му треба, може Македонија да му даде? Што е еквивалентно на Алшари и сл прикаски? Не мора да е којзнае колку реално, доволни е идеа со некој потенцијал или сл.<br>
Бугарија и за САД и за Русија стално ќе биде поважна од Македонија. Русија со војна е и скоро основач на модерната Бугарската држава, удел во азбуката, па може да се каже и во модерната нација. За Русија ми личи, дека на Балкан по интерес се 1-Бугарија, па 2-Србија, па 3-Грција. Тешко да се пробие Македонија и на позиција 3, а не па погоре.<br>

Net zero crap, Chagos, Incapacity benefits, Mobility luxury cars. After 30 sec deliberation from the top of my head.<br>
Next bring inhouse any number currently outsourced services that are just leaking pounds like sieves, are feeding frenzies for contractors, poor value for the rest of us.<br>
Next shutdown or rather bring back quangos into the public sector. Shutdown the Unaccountability Machine. Stop the bungs for friends & family conveyor belt. Most eggreguous examples-jail a few ministers. When did UK last jail one for corruption?<br>
Next put through Parliament the @lfg_uk Looking For Growth draft law.<br>
Next repeal or severely curtail Towns and etc Planning act restricting building. If X wants something built on their land, and Y wants to prevent that-than if Y wins by law in court etc, then it has to pay compensate X for opportunity cost. That will concentrate minds.<br>
Next end Leasehold insanity. Stop 5M people worrying about that semi-criminal enterprise and let them be productive members of society. ECHR challenge? Put carve-outs through in Parliament in a single session.<br>
Or get out of ECHR all together if the lawyers that occupy the commanding heights of UK society are unable or unwilling to make it work for the majority of the UK. Next time a ridiculous sentence like "community service for theft #200, we expect him to not steal for 201-st time" is in the media, the Chief Justice or whoever is their boss and top dog in the judiciary branch: bring him in Parliament, for public grilling, to explain it to a Parliamentary Commission or some such.<br>
The taxes are ATH, state spending at ATH, yet nothing works. Of course that means money badly spent. Victorians built more, with much less money, and much worse technology. I do not accept that contemporary brittons are stupider than their predecessors or lazier or can't do stuff. That is *not* the case. It's not about left or right. It's about basic state competencies.

TBH Македонија најпаметно да ангажира некој PR талент-шарлатан. Некој харизматичен лик, како археологот од Охрид со многу саати на рака. (нешто да знаел колку е саатот во разните универзуми?) За да почне да плете добри фантастични приказни. Нешто скриени злата на Александар, микс со прастари рудници, плус Алшари ретки минерали невидени непознати богатства. (ама за беља ете закопани во земја, нешто така; како Литиум Србија) Може и да врзат со камената вселенска опсерваторија. Тука нешто и со AI, па Портали, паралелни светови и слично.<br>
Па ако се случи нешто неочекувано, некако Бугарија, Грција, Албанија да се договорат (не верувам, ама за секој случај) "конечно да го решат македонското прашање". Ако се случи да бараме воена помош и војска од САД, да има МКД tribute, нешто за давање, што може да му се понуди даде во залог на Трамп. Како Украинците со нивните "ретки руди и минерали".<br>
Може ако има некои од тие клик-спамерите од Велес (со рекламен $$$ од фејк њуз "Breaking! Папата Умре!") ако ги има уште, од нив да ангажираат за кампања на Фејсбук, Трамп Соушал. Може сега најново некој shitcoin нешто крипто да направат, па и така да вложат во ликот и делото на Трамп. Може тоа и најефективно, best value for money. Да вложи MKD $100М од државен буџет во некоја "стратегиска крипто резерва" на Трамп и тоа добра инвестиција? Осигурување за секој случај, за недајбоже.<br>

They can be hired-fired on the strength of their party loyalty. Select 10% of them that are in-confidence-enough, able and willing. That's 1% of the public sector workforce. Assign 10 accounts to each. Multiply by the known size of public sector in various countries.<br>
Now 100K does not look out of reach for many countries, no?<br>
It annoys me to no extent the there is no market mechanism to compel Zucks and Musks of the Tech to offer optional 1) realHumanIRL; and or 2) realHuman; 3) filtering/selection on 1&2 yes/no.<br>
I am fine with pseudo/anonymous and all manner of accounts, I'm not advocating for any compulsory ID by anyone, not on X, not on the Web, not on the Internet. (and I'm against compulsory ID cards in the UK; whenever that topic arises)<br>
I'm advocating for 1) on X only 2) accounts that *do want themselves* do have *real person* verified by X, 3) for X to have a process to do that, 4) for accounts that want it themselves; and 5) I as a user of whatever designation - free, premium, premium+, verified or not, to 6) have tools where I can filter, select etc posts and accounts on that axis of difference, verified real life/human yes/no.<br>
I already do this to some extent imperfectly by necessity via lists etc. Just advocating for X to help me a bit. I already e.g. verify my ID to my bank to use their online services. X could offer—non-compulsory, voluntary for accounts that want it—service for that.<br>
Again—voluntary, for X only, accounts that do want it themselves. Coupled with the option of others to filter select on that, yes/no optional.<br>

In the UK we are paying a price for that.<br>
I got the impression most of the activists lobbyists class don't know their kWh of energy from their MW of power, and that still have not learned and internalised that supply must balance demand every second of every day, or "very very bad things will happen".<br>
The wide pubic are of course ignorant of that, as they should be! The above is not a slight on the Great British public.<br>
The ruling elite, on the other hand, should know better. The feedback mechanism will kick in action, and lead to demise of the current established and instalment of the new incumbent elite at some point. But I fear that point will come only when the general public is alerted to the state of affairs.<br>
And that is likely to happen via a nation-wide blackout. Of the type when UK has to resort to the Dinorwig to bootstrap its National Grid back online from a total power-off. With people stranded on trains overnight, dozens in ICU dead with machines cutting off after generators run out of diesel some hours into the blackout.<br>

Now it was spelled out to me, can't stop seeing it left and right everywhere now: 😭 human stupidity is not low IQ, it's lacking in morals. It's wrongly deciding what's good, and what's bad.<br>
Forget AI for enhancing supplementing Human Intelligence, that's a sideshow. If AI can be patient and cunning enough to get into the mindset of cretins like the dude above, somehow manage to alter their value system, about what's good and what's bad, that would HUGE. Help humanity with its current predicament: too many of us are too stupid.<br>
That level of collective stupidity makes cohabitation with very large numbers of people not work. The stupid will choose a course of action that is neutral or disadvantages themselves even, while creating humongous cost and pain and suffering to scores of people around them.<br>
There are no easy solutions afaik. The stupid are genuine. The imbecile above is not faking it. He genuinely thinks mass murder of people his father happily lived with, is good. Destroying levelling cities his father built, is for the better.<br>
No not-stupid person can forecast and counter the stupidity displayed above. It will not occur to a not-stupid human to think up that kind of thinking as a possibility. It's a hard problem. 😳 Also seems of fractal nature—stupidity permeates thinking about all things, big and small. Starting with the very foundational one at the base: killing other people is wrong, isnogood. My god. 😶<br>

I read somewhere that it's part of the bot farm keeping the accounts "warm", not allowing them to go "cold". (and be detected and deleted by X? IDK, guessing here) I noticed them because they were all 0 or 1 Following or Followers, (e.g. like @ Lisafuka), but were not created in Feb-2025.<br>
Ok, re-checking now, last 3 (@ Lisafuka, Stacy_he_nu, Lesliezusu) are from [Dec-24,Jan-25]. So not that long ago. I guess they create them 1st, takes sometime to create them in bulk. Before they start using them.<br>

But even without these drugs, say if I starve myself in controlled fashion, and with exercise, there is still muscle mass.<br>
So to me "is there muscle loss" is not much of an interesting questions. We know the answer is—"yes". Yes, when I weigh 130kg I will have more muscle muss than when I weight 90kg. Even when I lose the 40kg with self-starvation.<br>
The more interesting question for me is: if I reach 90kg (from 130kg) with two methods, two routes 1) self-starving 2) Mounjaro, then which is the route, that leads to less muscle loss? (relative, absolute, combo of measures, etc)<br>

Hey thanks for the reply and the kind words.<br>
Outliers in high-dimensional spaces early indicators of emerging patters? Yes, possible. Do tell more if you can please. :-) I'll have to think about it. I have no thoughts on that at present time.<br>
Only maybe vaguely related, that I have one thought on. On the quantity->quality transition. (this "quantity->quality" I recall from high school philosophy class lifetime ago.) I've been minorly but for some time annoyed by not having good knowledge on how to say select good number of components in PCA, (and related - ICA, and other dimensionality "reduction" methods) without "rule of thumb", trial and error, "method". If this looks something that maybe relevant, read on. Otherwise, feel free to stop here now.<br>
Suppose I have a 5-dimensional observation and I'm wondering if it's really only 4 dimensions there. One way I check is - do a PCA, then look at the size of the remaining variance along the axis that is the smallest component (the one at the tail end, when sorting the PCA components by size of the variance explained). If the remaining variance is 0 for the 5-th component - that's easy, I can say: well, it was only ever a 4-dimensional observation that I had after all.<br>
However, in the real world it's never going to be exactly 0. What if it is 1e-10? 1e-1? 1? At what size does the variance along that smallest PCA axis count as an additional dimension in my data? The thresholds are domain dependent - I can for sure say that enough quantity in the extra dimension gives a rise to that new dimension, adds a new quality. Obversely - diminishing the (variance) quantity in the extra dimension removes that dimension eventually (and with total certainty at the limit of 0).<br>
I can extend the logic from this simplest case of linear dependency (where PCA suffices) all the way to to the most general case where I have a general program (instead of PCA), and the criterion is predicting forecasting the values in the extra dimension, with the associated forecasting error having the role of the variance in the PCA case. At some error quantity >0 I have to admit I have a new dimension (quality).<br>
Emergence and similar 1) where that quantity is large enough to give rise to new quality 2) this this new quality becomes a new dimension in the phenomenon investigated; my observations data goes from N-dim vector to become (N+1)-dim.<br>
("More is Different" is a succinct summary of "enough quantity becomes a new quality")<br>

In N-dimensional space, for sufficiently large N, every N-point, is an outlier. In that N-space, the space moves in the corners. There is little space left in the centre. We know this, because when looking at what happens to the ratio of N-ball to N-cube N-volume measures, we see the ratio drop quickly with increasing N.<br>
For example, in a latent N-space of say an LLM layer, where N=1K all the way to N=10K. All the data points the layer ever tunes to, will be outliers exclusively.<br>
It's unfortunate that our intuition about how the space fills, that we build on examples from our physical world where N=2 or N=3, is not only inadequate, but outright deceptive to us. Those things for high-N, stand exactly the opposite, to how they are, for low-N. Various measures of centrality, that we think of as representative, are actually not representing what we hope they are.<br>

Those around him do have a plan though it seems.<br>
Volcker 2. Tariffs instead of IR to raise prices, reduce consumption of the below median half of the country, fight inflation. Energy independence to stave off any imported inflation from weaker dollar. Shitcoins to create dollar doubt, if not competition, weaken the dollar.<br>
The grifting element, all the way to semi-criminal one, is strong with him. But there's incompetence to go with the malice too.<br>

YT algofeed always seems to find +1 podcast about "universal unified theory this" or "quantum that". Looks to me like a crisis of reading and comprehension. Not crisis of writing? This will add to the already plentifull supply side. IDK.<br>
If it helps us with gravity, designs some wildly successful anti-gravity device or rocket engine, I guess I'd be bowed over. Something SciFi now - like changes curles space into some swirl, gravity undoes itself etc. Some magic like that.<br>
Seems to me while humanity has made inroads with electricity, magnetism, nuclear - but little progress on gravity? We are almost as shackled to Earth as Cromagnons were. Progress = devise clever trick how to lift loads off the earth, (and into space,) thousand times or million times times more efficient than currently.<br>

To me looks he wants for the war to go away, in whichever way. For fighting to stop. While cares not about what happens to Ukraine. If Russia could conquer it today, and make the problem go away that way—that'd be fine with Trump, Musk etc. That's the only consideration.<br>

One wishes—but only #1 is realistically possible.<br>
#2 Implies American soldiers dying in Ukraine. Given US loathes (and or is scared etc) to sell weapons to Ukraine, don't see how #2 is realistic.<br>
#3 Is even less likely. Putin has not given up on taking over the whole of Ukraine. That's still his aim. Given he's got US neutral now (if not outright ally) with the cut off of US weapons for Ukraine, IDK why he would give up now.<br>

Having said that. I'm not going to litigate what I wrote or didn't, with a cross between Wittgenstein and Kafka's interrogator its seems. IDK you IRL, and pseudo-anon too.<br>
In general terms, how I think of this, for the benefit of any reader. (articulated imperfectly again.) I speculate of something ("x") that happened in the recent past, that may influence something else ("y") that may or may not happen in the future.<br>
1. Some ideas exist in my head, deciding on x, y, knowing of f(x,y);<br>
2. Then my words communicate the x, y, and the change between f(y|x) and f(y);<br>
3. Then on the receiving end, in the head of the reader of these words, the words trigger: their's x, y, changes in g(y|x) and g(y).<br>
There is little chance that the identical setup exists in your head too (identical x and y, f==g). Allow for incompetence to explain what may come over to you as malice.<br>

Normies—too selfish? too self-entitled to create something for all, for nothing? for the love of the creation, and nothing else?—do not realize what has happened. How the world they live daily in was created.<br>
Not to be too harsch—but the (non-CompSci) intelligentsia class is even more ignorant, if that's even possible?? Have yet to meet a single aspiring marxist that's ever heard of the ideas of Free and or Open Software, FSF/RMS etc.<br>

No wonder you are losing your war. What's said there is delusional. It's like when small children want the world to be as per their desires.<br>
Fossil fuels are super cheap. That's the problem with them! That's why the world can't kick them out. They are cheap and easily available.<br>
If renewables were "too cheap to meter", like your side has been saying for decades now, the switch would have happened quickly, easily, painlessly. There would be no need for extra policy—would happen on its own.<br>
Wind and solar are expensive when the need to be 100% reliable is factored in. Hence the need for subsidies etc. I have rooftop solar + batteries, know my kWh energy from MW power, know that national grid needs to balance every second of every day. There is not one country in the whole world, with BOTH significant wind+solar AND cheap electric energy. Not one.<br>
Being ignorant and innumerate is your biggest enemy.  One can think anything about Marx, but few would disagree—he was clear eyed in his analysis. His acolytes nowadays—not so much.<br>

Often we are interested only in the amplitude of the FT. We don't care about the phase. Say we take 256 numbers in time domain, do DFT, come up with another 256 numbers in FT domain, then throw away the 128 phases, and use only the 128 amplitudes.<br>
Wasteful spending processing to get 256 numbers, then throw away 1/2 of them. Hartley Transform to the rescue. It's like "FT in real domain only". Instead of DFT, we do DHT Discrete Hartley Transform. And we get our 128 amplitudes only right out. No flops wasting.<br>

Haha 😂 - good takes there! Two things.<br>
1) The retarded "low IQ" is not lack of reasoning capabilities, it's bad morals. Doing stupid is downstream from thinking good is bad, and bad is good. (from our PoV) Also facilitates "be nice again" to genuine retards with real hardware faults.<br>
I saw that argument put forward in a YT video on stupidity - Bonhoeffer‘s "Theory of Stupidity" 1) stupidity is low morals not low IQ; and 2) it's social, a mind virus (ha!-Elon!) in humans groups more than individuals. (extending Cippola's "stupid is one causing harm to others while not deriving any gain, even taking a small personal loss"; links https://x.com/ljupc0/status/1895824224029184268).<br>
2) Soviets, and then Russians inherited it, score well at anti-rationality: flood the field with sh*t, (Bannon; after Surkov) lie mercilessly destroy the possibility for there being a single truth. Industrial quantities of random cr*p do exhaust our thinking capacities.<br>
Western "useful idiot" of the old ("govnojed" in the designation of their Eastern appreciators) has been replaced by a 21-st Century "nutnik" (= nutter + vatnik) online variant.

I have considered that possibility. Yes, it's possible that that is the reason.<br>
Good. I encourage you to continue digging evidence, evidence for-, and evidence against-, that possibility. Because it's not certain. Could be as you say, could be something else. Could be both to some extent.<br>
And if you want to, you come up, or read up read on, on another possibility. And then dig for evidence for-, and evidence against-, that other possibility.<br>
Typically I try to net the evidence, as one has to weight multiple items of evidence, for each of the possibilities. To somehow  "add evidence" one on top of the other, both for- and against-. To get to some measure of "how likely it is" that the possibility is true.<br>
Then as if in a trial, but where a jury decides not "beyond reasonable doubt", but "on the balance of probabilities", I try to make up my mind.<br>
Yeah this takes some effort and time. So for most things I don't do it. I have not got strong opinion either way. If someone asks me, I say IDK "I don't know". To tell you the truth—that's a bit liberating, as if not carrying weight on the shoulders, to not have to worry that much, about most things.<br>
But for few things I take interest in, maybe out of fancy, or because they impact my life and I'm forced to make some decision, I try do as described. hth<br>

Fwiw I think there are constraints, the number of options is not infinite. But also we have the power to actively chose between the options. Or even engineer an option extra. It's not beyond us humans. So I don't give anyone, not least the academics, a "get out of jail free" card.<br>
Coming back to morality/epistemology. Yes—the academics are as guilty as anyone for mistaking "good or bad", for "true or false". Too many take the easy feeble minded routes "I like therefore good therefore true", "I dislike therefore bad therefore false". In that they are like most people though. For we are usually worse than morals->truths. We take another shortcut, we go beauty->morals->truths! 😱 So aesthetics driving morality driving epistemology.<br>
Having spent time in academia as postgrad (and having academics in family), my opinion of academia is probably less than the average. I found writing papers boring, few people inspiring but most not. Young students were great—bright sparks there. For me writing code was interesting, getting things to run and do stuff worth my effort. So spent my time in industrial R&D. (also—better pay, important when relocating countries/starting new life, more meritocratic b/c easier to establish merit)<br>
Given that academic research is supposed to free people from commercial market pressures (research funding is decided more like central planning), so they have more time to think more, be more free thinking, it's doubly disappointing how few do anything of the sort. How few live what one might call  "examined lives".<br>
Anyways. Coming back to again to morals/epistemology. Not long ago stumbled online on the idea that wilful ignorance to the point of stupidity is a moral failing, a case of bad morals, not a case of low IQ, or lacking rational thought.<br>
I saw that argument put forward in a YT video on stupidity - Bonhoeffer‘s "Theory of Stupidity" 1) stupidity is low morals not low IQ; and 2) it's social, a mind virus in humans groups more than individuals. (extending Cippola's "stupid is one causing harm to others while not deriving any gain, even taking a small personal loss"; links here https://x.com/ljupc0/status/1895824224029184268). And the more I noticed, the more convinced I become that it's more true than I thought initially.<br>
(I started if not sceptic, then a bit prejudiced against the claim; seemed mildly counterintuitive b/s click bait; hoped to dismiss it as it seemed bad news on first sight)<br>

Yep - a well worn trick. Having not read the paper, just guessing. Instead of convolution or correlation or similar of x and y in time domain, first Fourier transform x and y into X and Y, then multiply X an Y in Fourier domain, then transform the result back in time domain, by inverse Fourier transform.<br>

I'd assume he did, I 'd assume the OP thinks that's corrupt too. Why wouldn't he?? An average reasonable personal would.<br>
I am not USian, live on the other side of the world, follow not US politics. Yet years ago when it was in the local news that "no good, without qualifications, son of a president, earns millions for not doing much in a far away country" thought - well that smells of corruption of some sort.<br>
But by the same token, ask yourself now: why did *you* think the OP thought Biden son was not corruption? Why did you think so? Did you think so, because you value your side more, than whether something is true or false? You won't be the first to be using like/dislike as a way of deciding on whether something is true/false tbh. Most people use their feelings to decide on truthfulness.<br>

Yep it makes sense.<br>
To me "AI will enslave us" moral panic looked the usual moral panic BS too start with. Something we humans do with every new tech.<br>
Then I thought "we are anthropomorphizing this again". (prior examples of us doing similar https://x.com/ljupc0/status/1877086487038316725) Enslaving a weaker species is what we humans elect to do. So we assume by automatism that every other species would do the same.<br>
But now @SchmidhuberAI makes an excellent point: the energy and matter needed to further an Intelligence on a cosmic scale, is found outside of our biosphere. So that's where AI will go to expand.<br>

I found being aggressive even preemptive in shaping the feed pays dividends.<br>
Remember - Block-ing is now one-way block only. It simply means your account becomes read-only to the blocked. While it also does inform the algorithm. Much closer to Mute. I used "Show me less of/this" too, but that became a chore quickly, as is multiple taps.<br>
True the Algofeed seems very aggressive in that interaction with subject Y brings in a flood of Y-related into the feed. I maintain thematic accounts Lists, (and especially fit well Xpro Decks) and they do work to remedy the above problem. They are like thematic extra "For you" personalised feeds.<br>
Yeah the revealed morals of Musk/oids are a disappointment. But hardly new or surprising, right? Their stupid antics are kept mostly out of my feeds at low level acceptable with the above. (and thanks to them, researching on stupidity lead me to learning "stupidity is not low IQ, but is low morals, being imoral" etc-very useful knowledge! every cloud silver lining etc)<br>
Having said that-no reason to not have accounts everywhere and replicate your social graph Following-Followers everywhere really. It's the social graph ands not the posts history that keeps us in the walled garden. The “public square N² iron law of network value” is not going anywhere. It's the price we pay to have a semblance of single public square.<br>

IDK much physics and am physics' nobody, so persuading me will not bring you closer to your aim.<br>
You need to persuade other physicists. I imagine physicists doing research outside academia maybe more receptive to new ideas then ones inside.<br>
Science is a social activity. It's practices by groups, not mere single person. Getting something right that others get wrong is a first step only. Necessary but not sufficient. Everyone has their own idea how they are to use their time they got allocated here and now. They will not give you their time willy-nilly. We all have other things we want to do.<br>
Still I think 1) making a forecast about the future; or 2) achieving some feat, currently impossible, is the best way to make people give you some of their time.<br>

Is this a physics model?<br>
If it is, then afaik you can make a forecast of something that will happen, that will be observed in the future. Then your model needs to be correct about the observation. While the currently used models get it wrong.<br>
Then someone will take notice. Typically some younger upstart.<br>
Or maybe you make a machine that achieves some feat, currently impossible. Physics related - seems to me while humanity has made inroads with electricity, magnetism, nuclear - seems little progress on gravity?? We are almost as shackled to Earth as Cromagnons were.

Please if you can work on your character. Find a religion, or maybe read on religion or philosophy or some such. Or even find a moment you can spare for yourself, think about life and universe and everything.<br>
You are being stupid, but stupidity is not mere low IQ or being bad at reasoning. No—stupidity is a moral failing. It's the case of bad morals. Thinking that something is good when it's bad, and the other way around. Links with YT videos<br>

Money for what? Donated what? It's not his war. Russia is trying to conquer them, subjugate them. It's attacking their cities daily, killing them where it can. They are defending their lives, their country. If they lay down their arms, they will be killed. That's why they are fighting and not surrendering. If it was him fighting a war without support of the other 40M people, there would have been no war. As he would have been removed on day one.<br>

I dislike his AI doomerism too.<br>
However—imo saying it's *all* fear-mongering is too strong a claim. Yes—there is more fear-mongering that I'd ideally want to see. But there is more than that.<br>
There is part that is not fear-mongering. For example analysing information flows in humans' information networks. (in Nexus) I like him analysing human organisations and how information flows. Reading it placed in historic context is interesting too. Many CompSci people do the same for machines. But not so much for humans. And with humans, mostly concern themselves in the context of Social Media.<br>
Having said that: I can't understand how anyone can write a whole book on the topic of information, and forego the opportunity to tell millions of readers: "you think information is something strange, or amorphous, or not well defined, but we actually have a very good handle of Information. This is how it's defined. (...I flip a coin, hide the result; now I know and you don't; next I tell you the result; there—I just gave you 1 bit of information...)." And tie that in with probability, and with Shannon entropy, and with "how much information do we gain when observing one symbol." But hey—probably I'm wrong thinking this. For only one among us is a best selling author. 😇<br>

You are forecasting a future your detractors wish for. You maybe right, or you maybe wrong.<br>
However, we have the recent past, where UK followed on the policies you advocate for. This past is not in doubt. The results are in, and they are uniformly bad. UK contribution to global-anything is minuscule, the effect insignificant. At the same time, the country is croaking under the weight of those policies. Your policies already made UK weaker and poorer than it needed to be.<br>
I wish we could go in time, and undo the damage your policies had done. But that's not possible. So the 2nd best thing, one possible, is to stop listening to anything you say, and bid you and your policies good bye.<br>

I hear you, but don't you think "maintain an epistemology that is independent from their morality" is too much of an ask? We'd need super-humans, angels for that. Is that even possible for everything?<br>
Isn't more achievable "be aware that my epistemology is influenced by my morals, be vigilant, test what you can, in preference to assuming"? I mean sometimes it's easy. I can see with my own eyes if the sun is shinning right now or not. But for anything non trivial it quickly becomes a question of trust.<br>
With natural sciences we have got independent from us feedback to guide us. We are lucky that way. Everyone else is more at sea than us.<br>

Is anything wrong with pushing Putin to stop attacking Ukraine? All I read from you and Moscow Musk are calls for Ukraine to stop defending and lay down arms. Well—they can't do that, for Russia will simply murder them.<br>
Have you or Musk ever called on Putin to stop attacking Ukraine, stop murdering Ukrainians?<br>
There used to be a sliver of people called the "useful idiots" until 1990 in the West. They were called "govnojeds" in the East by their appreciators. In the online age I have seen "nutnik" = a vatnik, that is nuts too. You shouldn't aspire to be a nutnik Lex.<br>

I wish you were right. But I fear you'll be shown wrong by future events.<br>
IDK for sure ofc, as I haven't got any special or non-public knowledge. I'm not in the US nor from the US. I'm observing as if a light from a distant galaxy. Given this is online chatter, a little tittle-tattle is not beyond me too. ;-)<br>
Having said that—I do have a viewpoint. As this, and the outcome of the whole thing, affects me too.<br>
IMO Musk is exactly 180 degrees wrong thinking "if we don't give Russia what it wants, then WW3". I think it is that if US+Europe *do* give Russia what it wants, then we *do* get WW3.<br>
The perceived "wrongness of Musk" on our part, to the point of outright stupidity is explainable. Stupidity is not a low IQ or lack of reasoning. No—stupidity is a moral failing. Lack of morals. Or rather—set of morals contrary to our morals set.<br>
What's the set of morals that Musk subscribes to, that's at odds with the moral set we subscribe to? I speculate that it's a case of "master morality". Putin's strength is virtuous, war is admirable, power is proof of righteousness. In a fight, back the stronger side. (might is right.) This is like the pre-Christian European morality—like that of Rome. That's why we observe Musk-ians playing with Roman salutes.<br>
Whereas the morality most of us subscribe to, is "slave morality". Slave morality is the idea that to suffer is virtuous. Christ suffered for us, suffering is noble. Conversely inflicting suffering is evil. This is the moral framework of Christianity.<br>

On a digital computer agreed—no I can't search. But then the computer is not continuous so that's expected.<br>
On an analog computer, say it's setup so it computes a minimum of a function, simply using the laws of physics as they do. And ends up in that minima state, therefore computing it for me.<br>
Wouldn't you say that it just searched through a continuous space? Or maybe you'd say: ah but it uses atoms and particles and stuff, they are not continuous either, they are discrete too, so the analog computer is not searching continuous space either.<br>

Right on and already under way but for writing, in the medium of text, not voice and speaking.<br>
Few nuances though.<br>
It will thin out replace the middle.<br>
On the top end meaningful relationships with close people family friends will remain. Even strengthen - if "love is all you need" improves the human condition and us human HI get it from robots AI. Good.<br>
On the bottom end talking to competent AI sales rep booking a holiday is superior experience compared to talking to a boring uninterested uninteresting HI rep trying to max his commission providing near zero value to me borderline cheating. That's not good for his soul. Good AI is replacing that.<br>
It's looking like that kind of HI human character development through AI supplementation maybe as beneficial to humans as any AI scientist R&D. And mass adoption may come sooner than singularity.<br>

That kind of stupidity comes from a moral failing. Not low IQ, but bad morals.<br>
In Bonhoeffer‘s "Theory of Stupidity" 1) stupidity is low morals not low IQ; and 2) it's social, a mind virus in humans groups more than individuals. Extending Cippola's "stupid is one causing harm to others while not driving any gain even at a small loss".<br>

True that. Is searching NP-hard in discrete spaces only? Is it that way because discrete space lacks continuity so we got no differentilibilty to guide our search? Ee have to blindly try one after the other without curvature as a guide?<br>
And does quantum compute - if and when it ever works out - offer potentially a way out of that predicament? In general not search specific. General opportunity to if not catch up with the curse of dimensionality, then at least not be left behind eating dust?<br>

They're doing it of their own volition. All Russia needs to do is to supplying minimal cover. Say in my psyop I lie mercilessly in industrial quantities. I simply say whatever is opportune and puts me to some advantage. True/false is not even a consideration. Tucker maybe "can't be all untrue", "where's there's smoke there's fire". Not unreasonable.

There is not certainty in anything. If US dropped a few, Mao might have changed his mind. Or people around Mao.<br>
Ofc the small states can just build more—so it's not 100M, but 1000M. For the alternative for the weaker side is to lie down and die.<br>
IDK why country as big as Russia (larges land mass in the world), or China (got good chunk of Asia) need extra land. So they go to great lengths to acquire more.<br>
But whatever is driving them is irrelevant as far as small guys are involved. If you are an ant, and an elephant is about to squash you—inflicting pain on him to remind him it's going to hurt, is your only option.<br>

I have nothing against that—but I have nothing specific to add tbh. IDK any details.<br>
I'm cognisant with the general Soviet and now Russia mode of operation though. In broad strokes, Surkov etc ideas: negation of any possibility for objective truth. Merciless lying in industrial quantities—even when near term there's no need for it—to destroy any possibility to any truth. Flooding us in random lies does indeed work. Drowns us in noise and exhaust our information processing capacity. It does kill the idea of one definite truth existing.<br>
Gets re-discovered from time to time, e.g. Bannon's "flood the field with shit". Trump gets it instinctively deploys it with charm (!!—yeah IK, but think it true), unlike Bannon. (who grosses out every living creature around)<br>
Note the contrast: US didn't deny they're going to invade Iraq, they were trying to manufacture reasons for. While Russia denied they are going to invade Ukraine (even while invading it). Similarly previously they denied they took Crimea - the "green man".<br>

Musk’s master morality in action is like fire: a good servant, but a bad master.<br>
At this point, he’s like the most dangerous kind of Bismarckian general—stupid and energetic.<br>
And of course, it’s Putin, not Zelensky, who can stop the train. If Ukraine gives up, the train doesn’t stop—it just runs over the Ukrainians still standing on the tracks. That’s why they keep fighting. For them, the alternative isn’t peace—it’s death.<br>

Detterence. It's in the name - "nuclear DETERRENCE". It's for the weaker side, the one that's defending, the one that's being attacked, to detter the aggressor , the one attacking, usually the bigger stronger side. To make them think twice, and hopefully not attack, not invade.<br>
No one is talking about winning any nuclear wars. MAD means - either peace, or we both die. It doesn't mean - I win you lose. The option of one side winning and living, while killing the loosing side, is taken off the table. That's the idea. To equalise the playing field. Either we both live in peace, or we both die.<br>

The making up of stuff, the level of stupidity that puzzles you—it's not an intelligence failing, not a question of mere IQ or reasoning or some such. No—that kind of stupidity is moral failing. It's bad morals.<br>
Or rather "bad morals" from the PoV of the "slave morality" most of us subscribe to. Our morality is "slave morality" because we take it for granted that to suffer is virtuous, one should turn the other cheek, and so on. And to inflict suffering is evil.<br>
Trump-ians subscribe to "master morality". They see strength as virtuous, Putin/Russia war of aggression admirable, the power proof of righteousness. In a fight, they back the stronger side. (Might is right.) This is like the pre-Christian European morality, like that of Rome. It’s why Musk-ians are playing with Roman salutes: they, too, are proponents of this master morality.<br>

Interesting. Although ngl, would expect of all areas where humans and non-human animals are measured how much similar-differ, the distance humans-animals in the organisation of sex and reproduction to be but as large as brain functions. I'd expect humans to have very unique setup relative to other animals. Almost as unique as their brains.<br>
Fyi there exists an obscure '90s book "The Erect Woman" (original "The Planet of Women") arguing that sexuality, and in particular women's control of sexual attraction, and almost complete control of mating, (unlike many other species) is a key factor in human evolution. That sexual dynamics between the male and female halves of the species, facilitating cooperation between the halves forming long term partnership, jump started by sexual attraction (so not talking about intra-sex competition), is more influential than labor, tools, opposing thumbs, brain size, fire etc. The theory advocated is that sexuality created the human species. (in addition to sex creating every one individual.)<br>
(Possible that the author has joined the ranks of the cranks since. Unfortunate - but doesn't make his then arguments nil. In fact - the argument advanced in the book makes more sense than the competing hypothesis imo.)<br>

I came to think the personal animus Musk feels towards Zel, expressed every hour of every day by promoting and boosting even the most stupid of fake news, no exception, is the rage, one with "master morality", feels towards the a weak person, a person without power, that refuses to lie down, accept his fate, and die.<br>
It only looks to most of us as stupidity. It's not stupidity as commonly understood. It's not lack of brains or thinking. No, it's stupidity as moral failing.<br>
Or rather "moral failing" viewed from the PoV of our position, the ~80% of us, that subscribe to "slave morality". Most of us are Christians of various shades. Christ suffered for us, so suffering is noble. Inflicting suffering, conversely, is evil. This is the moral framework of Christianity. Slave morality is the idea that to suffer is virtuous.<br>
The other ~20% favour "master morality". They see Putin/Russia strength as virtuous, the war of aggression admirable, the power proof of righteousness. In a fight, they back the stronger side. (Might is right.) This is like the pre-Christian European morality, like that of Rome. It’s why Musk-ians are playing with Roman salutes: they, too, are proponents of this master morality.<br>

Afaik no—they are not asking for soldiers, only for weapons. Although if someone from Europe or US offered, doubt they'd refuse. But no one is offering, that's not on the table.<br>
I have come to think that people telling blatant lies—it is a moral failing, lack of character. Not lack of information or low IQ or some such.<br>
Or—a moral failing from the position of the prevalent morality of the ~80% of us, that is "slave morality". Slave morality is the idea that to suffer is virtuous.

TBH the words "pariah state" sound to me like belonging to a different age. One we are leaving behind.<br>
NK was pariah even before the nukes. Others like China, India, Pakistan—got them, and are not pariah atm. Once the US umbrella no longer protects Germany, while Russia showing daily "On Berlin" slogans on prime TV, doubt many will begrudge Germans nukes.<br>
ABM—yes a worry, but 1) far from perfect; 2) the doubt the aggressor has "will my ABM hold" maybe enough for MAD deterrence to prevent an invasion; 3) the concrete case of Russia-Baltics-Poland-Nordics I'm not an expert but aren't St Pet. and Moscow maybe close enough that rockets don't need to go up in space and down?? IDK enough about those things tbh.<br>

You are wrong. Russia can't win the current war.<br>
Ukrainians decided they are to live, and live free, or die. As long as theirs is "give me freedom or give me death" Russia can't win in this conventional war. They are not making enough conventional weapons, nor mobilising large enough army.<br>
The only way they win is a nuclear war against Ukraine. Or give up and stop attacking. That's a draw. For Russia doesn't lose much in that case either. (hence waging a war of choice)<br>

Yes! What you are observing is that stupidity is a moral failing. Not intellectual failing, not low IQ or any such stuff—no, stupidity is a moral failing. A personal fail when it comes to morals.<br>
It's so rare an opportunity, relative to the importance of the topic, that I take the liberty to post two under-watched videos on the topic.<br>
Bonhoeffer‘s "Theory of Stupidity" makes a second good point (to the "it's a moral failing not IQ")—it's a social phenomenon, it goes in groups, almost like an infectious disease (a "mind virus" even!)<br>

Yeah. IDK about that. I have only got a sideview interest. Of the type "you may not be interested in war/Russia, but they are interested in you". Never been there, don't speak the language.

I was a young person in 1990-s though. I lived through interesting times. (collapse of the state ideology, collapse of the country, civil wars, starting up an upstart/startup ctry) The Kremlin/Russia state, its world view, the mode of operation (e.g. using minorities in neighbouring countries)—that all looks familiar to me, I understand it. Also I know how malleable historical memories are. Quite a lot of randomness is erased, made into a cause-consequence story, whereas my recollection is—there was none.<br>
Can't but note the "eastward expansion promise" reference. This has been explained so many times, the context, the meaning, all available online. I just searched saw an overview<br>

Yes—if Ukraine keeps a strong army.<br>
No—if it accepts the demands of Putin to reduce the army.<br>
This is what the quarrelling is about. I don't watch MSM b/c there is so much noise, that the actual reason for the spat is obscured.<br>
Afaik Trump demands that Ukraine reduce their army. This is what Putin demands as a price to stop attacking. (the war stops when Russia stops attacking) Ukraine doesn't want to do that. If they do it, what's to stop Russia invading them again. This time they will take Kyev and subjugate Ukraine. This is the Chechnya scenario. I too see that this is the Russian interest as currently articulated by Putin/Kremlin. That is still the aim of the invasion: to rule over Ukraine. They are not giving up on that. Why would they? Looks to me things are developing to their advantage.<br>
Yes indeed this is brought up because Europe. Europe is indeed somewhat special when it comes to War & Peace. Europe started not 1, but 2—2!!—World Wars! Not Ordinary Wars, but World Wars. Every other continent has not managed even a single World War, before *and* since. It's a bit of an over-achievement that. That bears on people's minds when making decisions. Correct.<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
Yes, I too think the war will drag on for as long as Russia attacks. (ofc Putin could give the order today, the war will stop; but imo that will not happen; for P has own reasoning too)<br>
The other options is for Ukraine to lay down arms. But that for them is to stop existing, and not only as a state Ukraine, but as ethnicity Ukrainians too. They may chose to—and the option is open every day—but I don't see any signs. The basic rule for anything alive/like—people, state, nation—is that their self-preservation, choosing life over death, is almost their definition.<br>
TBF I don't see how Putin will agree to stop attacking where he does not conquer Ukraine. The moment the war stops, Putin is in maximal danger. This is the reason he serially wages war in the first place. Waring increase his power, his control over Russia, empowers him relative to any contenders to the Russian throne. Allows him to stay both in power. (and alive probably!)<br>
As far as I understand looking from afar. The bone of contention is disarming of Ukraine, reducing their current army. Putin requests that. Ukraine (rightly, imo) calculates that the moment they disarm, Putin will just invade them again. And succeed the 2nd time. (like Chechnya)<br>
I see Trump doing the easy route. He just accepts everything Putin demands, and commands on Ukrainians to deliver that. That way the war indeed stops. However, also Ukraine and Ukrainians stop existing. I see how that is not going to happen easily.<br>
Vance and the Tech Bro Progressive Right (TBPR) wing of the coalition I see them as new, West Coast Elite. They are less invested in Europe than the old, East Coast Elite.  Naturally, their gaze is trained over the Pacific, towards Asia. Equally naturally, I the East Coast Elite is feeling more of an descendent of the WEurope civilisation, and looks more across the Atlantic.<br>
In practical terms, I think the difference Re: Europe between them is this. Say now that Germany lacks an army, Russia invades Germany and are fighting to take Berlin. West Coast Elite would be - "well tough sh*t Germany, but you decided to have no army, we are not going to defend you, when you decline to defend yourself". While the East Coast Elite would still send American army over to fight and die. (even if Germany itself decided on a death-by-suicide.)<br>
This is pure speculation flight of fancy on my part. 😁 I have not got much contact with, nor have a travelled that much, in the US. Just a story I tell myself that feels coherent to me, while explaining what I observe IRL. 😂<br>

Because Russia expands by conquering territory and then ruling it centrally from Moscow. That’s their historical mode of operation: add new land to the existing land you control. Do this enough times, and you become the largest country by landmass in the world.<br>
I’m not saying it’s good or bad—it’s simply their pattern of existance, continuing expansion. My own country was created in the process of one of these expansions, when the Russian Empire pushed out its then rival, the Ottoman Empire.<br>
In Europe, there used to be three major empires: the Russian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire (ruled by the Habsburgs). Alongside them are the nation-states like France—the oldest of the modern ones—and later younger ones like Germany and Italy.<br>
There’s an interesting compare and contrast between continental empires (like Russia) and maritime empires (like Britain, the Netherlands, and today, the USA). A good podcast on this was on Dwarkesh—an american military historian explained the different logics behind how these empires formed, expanded, and ruled.<br>

Yeah that is true. But it's also true that in a fit of rage and madness, Putin may decide to end the current Earth civilisation(s) and murder us  (and themselves) all. They have the means. So the risk is ever present.<br>
A reason I can think of for Russia to press for Ukraine in a way they didn't press for Afghanistan or any number of countries in Eastern Europe, is if they are convinced that conquering Ukraine is existential for Russia. Like if they don't do that—someone somehow is going to invade Moscow.<br>
But I don't see how that can happen, with or without Ukraine. In a way that it happened in the past. Like Macron orders the French army to march on Moscow? Then Russia will simply drop nukes on them. (and on Paris.) What other means is there for someone to threaten them. That's what I don't understand.<br>

Yeah the probability of a US fail is low, but the cost when that fail happens is very high: I some small State cease to exhist. There's no coming back from that.<br>
I am not talking about an ordinary risk, where I am maybe attacked in a war over some distant province etc. Talking about the case where my mere existing, is perceived my myself much bigger neighbour(s) as an act off enmity. And the neighbour wants to extinguish me as entity entirely.<br>

NK—was under sanctions afaik forever. Looked like US may invade them at some point. Then they managed to get the bomb. I don't think anyone on the US side talks about invasions any more.<br>
Iran—lacks a nuke. So don't really know how to use them in an argument either side. In the past it looked like US may invade them. But then with all the other wars, seems US backed off for time being.<br>
Expensive—yes they are. But if Israel much much smaller and poorer then now, and also than all other other countries listed above could, then presumably it's not impossibly expensive. (same with North Korea—it is small-to-mid-sized by population, but very poor) Being invaded and ceasing to exist is the most expensive, the ultimate price, from the PoV of a State.<br>

I'm mystified why don't small countries like Taiwan, the Baltics, Poland, the Nordics etc, that under existential threats from much much bigger neighbours, why don't they build nuclear weapons as deterrent? Isreal and North Korea did it—much smaller and or poorer. (South Africa too?)<br>
When faced with threat 1) existential; and 2) by hopelessly bigger adversary. These weapons are the great equaliser, from losing side, the small country moves into a MAD position, levels the filed again. As far as specifically existential threat from outright invasion is concerned. Not all threats. Just that one. But that's plenty.<br>
I presume I'm missing something, as no one is doing it. (except—Israel, North Korea)<br>

Enlist us users on your side. Bridge the content X—OpenSocial, or even better Any—OpenSocial, by having OpenSocial App "shadow" X and any other network. Every time I user post on X (and Bsky, Threads...), it's auto-posted on OpenSocial too.<br>
Individual users can't be blocked by X easily. Even if X retaliates and forces me to choose under threat of locking me out of X, expect half X users will chose OpenSocial over X. So it's a win-win for OpenSocial.<br>
ChatGPT App will help me re-create my social graph at OpenSocial. The ownership of the Follows-Followers Social Graph is what keeps us users in the walled garden. Replicate it—and you are golden. Instead of walled garden, make it OpenGarden. (there is your name!)<br>

Ah—so it's effectively a road tax of some sort. Tax that only people that drive a car pay. Yeah tax should not count towards the GDP I think.<br>
Otherwise, in general, if the seller of the service is the Gov (not the Private sector), so both the buyer and the seller are the Gov, the value will be hard to determine, the price can be arbitrary.<br>
Easiest workaround I see there to get a handle on the value provided, is to privatise it, make it done by the Private sector. Offer it on auction, tender it. Then the Private sector will bid for the contract, so a price will form. Then we  will learn of the value of the service provided.<br>

That will create a distortion of a different kind. Would imply that the value of the transaction is zero both on the Gov side, and the Private individual side that is selling the goods and services to the Gov. That would be the case only if Gov confiscated the provisions effectively, rendering the price moot.<br>
More accurate would be to count every $1 gov spend as 1/2. Say you assume the value on the Gov side is 0, that Gov is totally wasteful. Still the Private person on the other side to the Gov in that transaction, selling their goods and services to the Gov, does so voluntarily. We trust the Private side is doing the transaction of their own volition, b/c it's a good transaction for him. (better than all the alternatives available to them)<br>
Even more accurate would be assume that Gov spend value is 1/2 of the 1/2. For every transaction on the Gov side, given it's not voluntary, you have to allow that it maybe wasteful, or may not be. Fair to assume half-half chance knowing nothing else.<br>
Ergo, multiply every $1 of Gov spend by 0.75 when adding it to the GDP. ;-)<br>

Europeans have had two World wars. Not one, but two. No other continent has managed even one world war! Before nor since.<br>
They has been killing each other on an industrial scale for a time even before, but WW2 topped it all. There are hotspots with potential to ignite WW3 toda too. The idea was better keep them in, than out.<br>
Russia is no greater power than France, or Germany if it decides to be. No one is attacking Russia. The idea that Russia fears Germany or France today, while having enough nukes to wipe their cities 10 times over, is for the birds.<br>
I like reading counterfactuals as anyone. But your central thesis about Russia lacks solid logic.<br>

Yeah, and alternative measures GDP correlate at 0.9 so IDK what's detractors' argument.<br>
More meaningful per capita. That's published anyway. Just not headline reported. 50% of us can hold max 1 thought in our heads. Media honour that incentive.<br>
Tbh that chatter looks like laziness displacement activity to me. We dislike working doing increasing GDP. So sour grapes reasons abound.<br>

Accepted! 😇 No worries. 😆<br>
I'm not saying it's researchers doing anything nefarious! I'm/was one of them too. They are supplying what there is demand for—more power to them. It was supposed to be a jokey-jibe on my part, sorry it came across badly. 😊<br>
The algofeed forecast me well, and supplied me with a stream of "consciousness interests". This one<br>
<p><br>

...just prior. And with a recent (partly consciousness) ToE cast (this one https://youtube.com/watch?v=3fkg0uTA3qU) still fresh in my memory. So I snapped where I should have had more patience. Sorry about that.<br>
To me Joscha's argument make a lot of sense. That consciousness is—<br>
1) a lower level process, below learning we know and love,<br>
2) something babies are born with,<br>
3) such that it bootstraps itself, and then starts the rest of the learning process; we see<br>
4) humans with a fault in that circuitry never manage to learn.<br>
5) Likewise zombies in movies can't learn anything new—only stay with whatever level of knowing they had at the moment they were zombified.<br>
And to me that looks very much like that Lisp interpreter written in Lisp. I always have had soft spot for Lisp even if I never programmed in it. (only ever read some; Forth too) To have the code and the data the same structure—I feel why Lisp programmers get tad like touched by higher force.<br>
I grew up in 6502 where one is easily led to writing self-modifying code. (for most things non-trivial) I suspect maybe not-unlike Joscha. I allow it that I'm partial to this, less rigorous than one is to be. And for fun and fancy speculating with things that are to be taken with more seriousness.<br>
Thanks for coming back and hope no hard feelings. ☺️<br>

Yeah. Vast numbers of people vastly overestimate how much their words or images influence other people's lives. Artists especially - and I like the bunch in general and am sympathetic to - are by the nature of their vocation esp prone to. Yes dears you are unique and special - but so is everyone else.<br>
We are finding out that the number of writers is vast too! We scribble 1B posts every single day here, for free, of our own volition, without being asked to, becase we want to. For the joy of it. It's eyeballs that are lacking, supply outstripping demand.<br>
Revealed preferences show in black and white how much we are prepared to pay for words and images. And it's not that much! So "free" Internet is paid for by advertisers.<br>
Artists would be well advised to maybe acquint themselves with the ideas of Richard Stalman and the Free Software Foundation. For we are living more and more in the worlds they imagined.<br>
The computer revolution first, the Internet revolution next, now the AI revolution, happened were mostly done by mildly autistic and mostly altruistic nerds. Normies are too selfish, too self-entitled to create something for all, for free, for the love of the creation, and nothing else. Zero other compensation but the glory of creation.<br>
Fwiw I have come to think that the current AI, and the future hoped for ASI creation, is teaching us that compute transforming data→information→knowledge→intelligence→agency→... is all there is to it! AI path opened to AGI now and ASI latter where previously we didn't see any. Seems a foolish deal to me to frustrate, slow down, or even forego 2050s Intelligence Revolution that may times by x10-20x times total human wealth value the way the Industrial Revolution did in 1800s. So that we provide UBI to Disney shareholders?? Every one of us is richer, better off than any king of old!<br>

Don't attribute to malice what can be adequately explained by stupidity. Conspiracies exist. But they require non-zero planning and significant coordination. That are more than most of us can muster.<br>
Oft it starts with inexplicable act of stupidity. So stupid, that looking back, it's hard to imagine it was not planned. "Who does such a thing? It can't be a coincidence!" (narrator: yes it can be)<br>
Stupidity is a moral failing. Not mere irrationality or low IQ etc. It is hard for not-stupid to predict how the stupid acts. It doesn't make sense. Most of the time the stupid act leads to obv bad outcome. No one repeats it. All good.<br>
Once in a blue moon, the stupid act confers some unexpected advantage to the doer. Usually not $$. (at least not initially) Maybe personal satisfaction. (increased social standing to come latter.) They get lucky against the odds. Many notice but don't join in. The act maybe somewhat immoral, if not illegal.<br>
Few unscrupulous persons do join though. Even if some privately suspect their doing is stupid. But most that join are true believers. (you are more successful in the scam if you are not faking it.) They mimetically copy, repeat their actions, reinforcing each other. More see that things are working out for the stoopid, join in. The lunatic group becomes stronger.<br>
Most of the rest don't have a dog in whatever activity the crazies are engaged. The fire will not be immediately extinguished. From outside looks like the group action is pre planned. But it's just next person doing the same what I am doing. That's it. No planning at all.<br>

Yes, possible. I'm sure it crossed his mind, and more than that.<br>
I suspect he needs Belarus united with Russia firmly under his control for that. For that he needs for Lukashenka to die, and for Putin to manoeuver a replacement in position that will be absolutely loyal to him. (lacking local power base) And merge Belarus with Russia. (or at minimum—abolish the local Parliament, however enfeebled atm it may be)<br>
So it's a race, who will croak first: Luka or Putko.<br>

I'm thinking of them generating a 2D output by default (with diffusion), instead of default 1D (with autoregression). Even if I understand both can be made either way. 😆 Still kind of expect that their output can grow much faster with the size of the model than an autoregressive one.<br>
Given the entire output is worked on all at once, and in iterations (reminds me of progressive picture download), one think I'm looking forward to find out is whether the jokes writing performance will improve. People often remark how poorly current LLM-s do at creating jokes. CoT was maybe going to change that—but didn't.<br>

Her prominent presence in media and public life is indictment of the UK culture tbh.<br>
Narcissistic, self serving, not intellectually interesting, nor interested. Zero original thought at all times. Hence—attachment not only to an Idea-ism, but to a Person-ism! Suspect personal ego/ism never allowed a move-on from her "Marx mind blown" moment. (IDK enough to suspect using public sphere for private therapy)<br>
Gee Ash—your first discovery was your last. How very novel. Not at all like the half of the UK population, that can only ever hold a single idea in their head. And for half of that—the same idea all their lives. Ash included in that quarter. (sadly for us all, that couldn't avoid her had to endure)<br>
One allowance: most of the above applies to a good portion of public figures. So she is more of a rule than an exception.<br>

Well—"disappointment". They will get what they manage to win. Afaisi liberalism is a lot—DYI. Not be expecting that much from others.<br>
Hard to blame anyone for anything really. Liberals' is a minority position to start with. Few people (10% at most?) are ever of the type "liberty first and foremost" ideologically tbh. For most people—other things take precedence.<br>
But Ukraine not being enslaved to Kremlin again, contrary to all expectation—that's quite a boost, no? Maybe not on the level of the French Revolution, but maybe coming close to the American one, no?<br>

I am speaking for myself dad. 🤣<br>
Put your glasses on, please read trice what I wrote. 😅<br>
I did not write "I want to be American". (although I don't mind; I mostly like most of their culture) I wrote that all cultures around the world have been becoming more like the American culture(s) in the recent past (say since 1945). And are likely to become even more in the future (from now 2025).<br>
And the latest reason for that is that most of the world is on the Internet. Internet is a global network for sharing information. By virtue of mostly inventing and starting the whole Internet (and before that—Personal Computers revolution; and before that—Computers revolution), Americans are over-represented on the Internet.<br>
So most of the Information on the Internet is created by Americans. Naturally, the ideas carried by that information are ideas Americans hold dear, or important to them, or are concerned with in some way. Then all the rest of us, the non-Americans, read that information. The words on screen, upon us reading them, are converted into ideas in our heads. Then those ideas, drive our actions.<br>
That's what I wrote. But apparently—not clearly enough! Sorry about that. But thanks for coming back and making me feel much much younger than I feel otherwise!  😆<br>
Stay well my son. 😅<br>

Most are mostly not liberals at this point TBH. Liberals of old had some fire in their bellies. "Give me Freedom or Give me Death!" is a liberal slogan. ("Sloboda ili Smrt", na naski ;-) )<br>
Can you imagine Europe liberals dying for anything?? I can't. The most their liberalism extends is supporting (selected) others (e..g. Ukraine latest) fighting for their freedom.<br>
Nah—people in Europe thinking of themselves as liberals, are many other things. Fashionistas. Consumers. BoBo-s—Bourgeois Bohemians. Hipsters. (now extinct?? when did it happen) Urbanites. And so on.<br>
FT Ganesh noticed in this one particular instance questioned it (here https://ft.com/content/b82bb503-21bb-4d64-8f72-6c6801f3b196), and few (TGA?) had minor Qs asked, but that's about it. That's the extent of introspection. Very little. Zero answers too.<br>
And ofc no action. TBH "Fire in the belly" is not something that can be summoned that rationally. For that one needs to have some base belief, like "freedom is top#1 / everything else less important." (for a liberal) Don't think we'll see revival of that in WEurope. CEEurope liberals still got some road left. Still people valuing liberty, freedom first and foremost, above everything else. (current champions—Ukrainians) If one is tad cynical: in the long cycles, people value most that, what they lack the most.<br>

IDK have no brand loyalties myself.<br>
Have soft spot for Asus EeePC 701! A 7" wonder for 230 pounds in the UK. That little thing saved my life. :-) Kept me sane while commuting for 2.5h by train DtoD daily every day for couple of years. Think at that time closest to it was some Sony tiny laptop at x10 times the price and Windows no Linux.<br>
Latter I got some other Asus laptop, with cr*p battery and not so great screen, and shockingly bad touchpad. That was Linux buggy too—but could be bandaid with some .ko driver or some such.<br>
Since I've moved to 2nd hand Thinkpads (480s) and Macbooks for their RAM sizes. Only min 96GB RAM for me from now on—yay! :-) Now Macbook battery screen touchpad indulges me spoils me tbh. Find myself loathing looking at Thinkpads screens.<br>
MacOS instead of Xubuntu tad faff to get used to new env shortcuts etc. But between better h/w RAM GPU/NPU to try local LLM-s and "it's Unix" (if not Linux) and $ brew—not super hard. Can recommend.<br>

Easy. They were not trained to do so. There is never ever in their training data "I Don't Know" examples!<br>

I Don't Know why labs don't have a "I Don't Know" datasets. 😂<br>
The underlying maths, logic, the basic foundations are all there already! In estimating probability density functions (pdfs; which is what all ML models do, and operate on) we always always reserve some probability mass for "unknown", "unseen", etc. In classification there is always a category "None of the above", "etc", "Unknown". And so on.<br>
This should be possible to get it done tbh.<br>
IDK have not any insider info, but: it's not impossible that human preferences lead the designers astray a bit. Like if the Labs have User testing. And if user tests show people hate very much to be told back "IDK". Much more than being told the wrong thing back in fact. Like for weather forecasts: some (intentionally) skew to forecast too much rain, b/c people really really hate that particular error (forecast,real)=(sun,rain).<br>

😂 Една од најсмешните работи, не можам да се навикнам, да не приметам. 😂<br>
Зашто некој друг НЕ направил нешто што јас мислам требало да направи. (разбирам некој ДА направил нешто што ми смета и реагирам; ама што НЕ направил?? па секој од нас НЕМА да направи милијарда работи секој ден)<br>
WTAF??? Како тоа-јас во мислите командувам други луѓе, кои па треба да прават работи, го живеат животот, како јас што мислам (на 2 секунди) за нив?? И сега-ме изненадија, што НЕ направиле.<br>
Некогаш во расположение и при вишок време ги боцкам назад, малку да ги збунам така захухтани (ако не и запењавени): стварно те интересира ЗАШТО? Тоа малку филозофски прашање - ЗАШТО?<br>
Неочекувано ефективно. 😆 Пошто па кај многу од нас Македонците филозофија (и генерално мислење) е малку погрден збор, "ај немој да ми филозофираш". 😂<br>

I personally found them useful.<br>
I learned it in a London company where I worked for 3yrs. Don't think anyone did anything much with them. For me it was useful. The "next week"—for deciding what to work on. The "past week"—at the end of the year to collect when having a yearly report.<br>
So I continued using the same scheme in another company where I worked for 5yrs. We'd have a weekly group meeting, everyone saying few sentences. What they did, what they plan to do. (I work in R&D)<br>

For the record "avail yourself to work without recompense for free"—Is *not* what I advocate. I think creators should be compensated. I think that is important.<br>
I also think other things are important too. Like liberty, freedom, etc. It's never only a single thing we need to worry about. We have to juggle many balls and balance multitude of aims and means.<br>
Throwing people in jail b/c they write words, sing songs, draw pictures—is a bad way to go about those aims. We know better than that, can do better, that State violence there is unwarranted.<br>

Mostly people can hold a single idea in their head. Two completing ideas, at the same time, make them dizzy, uncomfortable, confused, scared, some become aggressive.<br>
The hope I hold for AI-Neurolink-... is to augment the human brain functioning somehow. Like a brain prothesis. Like writing and latter reading allows us to expand our memory.<br>

Catastrophizing is profitable; Savonarolas have an inherent advantage. We’re evolutionary wired to put 10x more weight on a bad path than on a good one when envisioning the future.<br>
When assessing the joint probability of "(rustling leaves, tiger)", the utility of errors "wrong and skittish" versus "wrong and eaten" is highly asymmetrical.<br>

No evolutionary advantage to it? The brain busy with more important activity—building itself up? Our parents keep us alive, memory is needed to stay alive, so no need to remember much? Do we start born with many more neurons than we need and use latter?—if so then maybe growing up the brain prunes itself ruthlessly. Maybe related?<br>

"I don't see any reason that shouldn't apply to IP"—the reason is that we value liberty. We want to be free to do as we well the hell please to do. That's the reason. We value liberty. Freedom—good, unfreedom—bad. More of the former, less of the latter, we are to strive for.<br>
"Scion blowing the inheritance on coke, whores and casinos"—not the worst thing in the world. If he wishes to, he should be free to do so. Not as great a loss as you seem to think. The children of the whores and the drug dealers will enrol to US Universities, go to Stanford, then start Unicorns in the Silicon Valley. Sounds good to me. Money well spent.<br>

Let us not imagine what Michelangelo would or would not have done. As these are counterfactuals we create in our heads are too malleable to our own desires. Let us stick to things we are fairly certain happened for real, in the real world, in the past.<br>
More recent—Vang Gogh comes to mind. As famously producing a lot, while earning zero for it. I'm not saying he was happy for that. I am just saying—it's possible, it's not impossible. He did create his art after all, that did happen.<br>
"Industrialising production based on a foundation of IP law."—indeed that was the case. Albeit famously Germany, US, now China, industrialised while enforcing little of non-domestic IP laws. So it is possible that IP laws subtracted, slowed down that, rather than accelerated it.<br>
"Which convention the internet has undone almost completely"—indeed, and how is that going? Is the Internet an impoverished for content place, where nothing is ever created? Boring and soulless? Or are we living through an explosion of creativity and creation unlike one ever seen in human history? I claim it's the latter.<br>
You counter a few things I don't claim. Like "I can't deny human nature". I agree. I don't deny human nature. I don't want to deny human nature. Why would I do that? That would be crazy on my part. I claim—you, imprisoning me, for writing something you find objectionable, is you denying my human nature. And so on.<br>

Yeah, that again is a related, but different discussion. Why do we compensate, what, and how.<br>
Yes I would be annoyed. Is my annoyance a good reason to throw the other guy in prison? IDK—maybe yes, maybe no. Up for discussion. When giving examples. I shy away from dreaming up most edge cases. Extreme cases are not going to be regulated well by any laws we dream up. Laws are for the median cases.<br>
Yes, creators need to be compensated—they deserve to make a living from their work. But this doesn’t extend to their grandchildren. Copyright laws should incentivize creation, not provide luxury for the descendants of the original creator a century later.<br>
AI creation is teaching us that maybe compute transforming data → information → knowledge → intelligence is all there is to it. Hobbling that chain, just so Mickey Mouse earns few more $$$ to Disney shareholders, while delaying the creation of non-human intelligence—that may not be the deal we want to take.<br>

Exactly! The moment warring stops, (Ukraine is not the first war either) Putin is in maximal danger. Imo he has every incentive to be in a war forever. E.g.

But no value is "taken away". At the point of idea conception—zero value exists.<br>
Say I dream up a "Better Mouse Trap". I don't build it myself. I don't sell it myself. I write about it on X.<br>
Has any value been created at this point? No. Value existing is zero. We can estimate the potential value. But—that's a forecast, nothing more. Can be anything from -Inf to +Inf. From the worst disaster, to being priceless. Median zero. Most ideas amount to nothing.<br>
Now you read my post on X. You build "The Better Mouse Trap Company". You produce "Better Mouse Trap" by millions. Value is created now, at this point only. By yourself. How much value? We don't know yet.<br>
You sell each trap for $10. You sell millions of them. Now we learned how much value got produced. It's $10M.<br>
Who created the value? Yourself. Did I help? Yes. Agree it would be good that I should be compensated for my contribution. But to say that I produced the value—is in my mind is untrue. You produced the value.<br>
Incentives. It's a related topic, but a somewhat different one. I dispute your claim that without IP people would not produce. In the past there were times with no IP laws. People still created. E.g. during the Renaissance artists like Michelangelo and Leonardo still produced art.<br>
I have a patent to my name. (now expired) Did I produce the invention in order to get a patent? No. I produced it without ever thinking about a patent. (in fact that part was a chore I mental-note-d "avoid in the future".) I did what I did because I loved doing. I had a problem, and I solved it. It was wonderful. One of the best days of my life tbh. Comparable to getting kids, or solving an up-to-that-point unsolved integral.<br>
The Internet, Linux, GNU—some of the greatest technological achievements—were built by people creating for the love of creation, not patents. So to say it's impossible—does not tally with reality.<br>
IDK why and how "slave-labour" you mention came into your head. No one is forcing anyone to do anything. People do stuff out of their free will. Kept secret, or giveth away, or sold for $$$—they are free to do as they freely choose. Only unfreedom is people locking up other people for the crime of copying words, picture, music etc. That's IP. Punishing people for copying and sharing ideas is effectively a thought crime.<br>

As I have less time left, I value it more.<br>
In my youth, I never thought much about the edge of my future horizon. I knew it was finite, but for every imagined limit, I could just add +1. That effectively made it never ending, infinite.<br>
Now I am cognisant it's not forever. I can see the edge. I now ration somewhat my time. When I spend it in the company of another person, I judge: was it better spent in/with company, than would have been spent alone?<br>
Especially with the Internet, there is usually at the end of every day, something I wanted to do, but I run out of time. (and I'm falling asleep on my feet)<br>
I imagine most people go through a similar proces. It feels natural, and seems logical to me tbh.<br>

Using anecdote, personal experience to make decisions affecting many. Effectively giving some cases weight zero, other cases weighted max 100. Heard people say they don't trust statistics. Apparently caring only about their favourite victim while discarding the rest is better??<br>
To me looks like emotionally not entirely grown ups in positions of power deciding things they should not be. Every decision carries in extremis emotional pain. A grown person should be capable of carrying that load. Not transfering to others. (and esp not to children.)<br>

How does it compare to similar buildup episodes in history? Do we know how the UK or US railways were built in the 19-th century? Or maybe the M-otorway network of roads starting with M1 in the UK after WW2? That's fairly recent.<br>

The latter - only if you don't realise value from it yourself. If you do realise value-then it's half-half, half-me half-you realised value. So not nullified but halved to yourself.<br>
Why wouldn't you realise value yourself? Maybe you didn't see it. Maybe most of the value is in the realisation, not in the idea. After all - abstract IP is just abstracts at that point. Zero value has been created yet. Imposing cost to others at that point strikes me similar to taxing unrealised gains.<br>
Maybe better balanced - if I don't want these words copied, I don't broadcast them publicly. I keep them to myself. I take care whom I share them with. It strikes me too much to expect everyone else to police prevent copy of these words, but for I to put zero effort in that.<br>

Your are not wrong there. Tax revenue collection is amongst the last state organs (others being - police, army) to go incompetent and fail. By definition - if the state exists, these guys do function. (to a degree)<br>
NB that's doesn't mean they're not lumbering giants crushing people left and right. They are. Betty would have probably suffered ther same predicament if say it was HMRC  that owed her money and had to pay her. (our of the ordinary established give-or-take for which they have well worn processes running) DWP may have done better as they are setup for giving out money as default. (HMRC is for taking in)<br>
My point is: once Betty is one off, out of established processes, it's very hard to make the machine carefor her. If the machine was a single human or few people - yes one could hope that they care. But the system is not that at all.<br>

As I said—I'm not going to litigate. Looked it up—everything said there about nuclear can be applied to any energy source.<br>
I have roof solar and battery. The self-use is about 40%, and with extra battery may get to 50%. On average, over the year. Extremes are - worst in winter 0%, best in summer 100%.<br>
That understates the challenge. Everything that is consumed must be produced, supply matching demand, not on average over a day or an hour—but every moment every second of every day. I also know my kWh of energy from my MW of power. And am not spooked when I hear "three phases" of electricity. I had a bit of Electrical Engineering training in my youth.<br>
Reading stuff I see many opinionated people who 1) either lack any knowledge, and particularly that there is no magic but must be supply==demand, or "very bad things will happen"; or 2) do not construct physics consistent models of the world.<br>
I have resigned myself that no change will come to the UK, until a nation-wide blackout happens. Of the type when UK has to resort to Dinorwig to bootstrap itself back. With people stranded on trains overnight, dozens in ICU dead with machines cutting off after generators run out of diesel some hours into the blackout.<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
Ok, I'm not going to litigate that. Just to note for the record. I don't think that nuclear is expensive. I think it's average-to-cheap. And can be made much much cheaper, should be choose to.<br>
On a meta-/epistemic level. When I take a stance on an issue, I force myself to think "what evidence would convince me I'm wrong". It's bit of a chore that. Not pleasant, not something one looks to. On the plus side, on most issues—I lack particular view. That I find somewhat liberating.<br>
I have had help there professionally. Doubly so.<br>
Programmers writing programs have to think "I wrote this, I think it's correct, but I know there is an error". With the added terror: "If I made 1 error, then my thinking process is faulty; if my thinking process is faulty, 1000 errors maybe lurking in these 1000 lines of code".<br>
Traders when placing a bet also typically set up a stop-loss "if I lose X on this, I will accept I was wrong, and liquidate the rest".<br>

Sorry to be rude and interrupt - but that's logicaly inconsistent.<br>
If it were as global as it's said, US would be paying as much for energy as UK. Or UK as much as US. Or both some middle price. The prices would be about equal. That's what global market means.<br>
These are all choices. Few things are inevitable. But for most things - UK gov chooses option 3 over options 1 or 2. The price of energy is one such choice. Other concerns take precedent over the price we pay for UK gov. Claiming lacking agency is self serving. Power without responsibility.<br>

Merkel was not a mere NPC like myself or yourself. She was *the* leader. The one person that sought (and got!) the position to lead. So she bears a lot more responsibility when a decision turns bad. Esp decision where there were reasonable credible forecasts about what may happen.<br>
Nuclear exit and energy in general. Say what you want about someone like Vaclav Smil, but he is not 1) ignorant; or 2) with a poor record.<br>
Remember seeing a video from him >10yrs ago making the argument:<br>
#1 you got 70 GW reliables now;<br>
#2 replace with 70 GW un-reliables + 70 GW gas backup reliable.<br>
How is option #2 not going to be more expensive than #1? It will be more expensive. And—can always cut the un-reliables out of #2, and just use the 70 GW gas all the time.<br>
I got reminded, as the UK predicament is exactly the same at this very moment. UK are now getting consequences (==cost, the bill) of dunderheaded wishful thinking. And I see no thinking process kick in. We are on auto-pilot, led by seemngly innumerate PPE-s. That are only capable of numeracy when their personal bank accounts are in consideration.<br>
I expect more from a PhD in natural sciences tbh. And a lot more character too! She was not some grifting telesales operator selling dodgy "financial products". The UK PPE-s strike me more of the grifting types seen in finance. On them—I'm less surprised.<br>

Always astonishes me how small RoI for the grifter it is when fleecing the public purse. How cheap some random brothers are: cost the public a Billion (with a B), get back a Million (with an M). RoI of 1/1000. (yeah I know, I know it's not grifters' Billion in the denominator, they put zero in, for them 1/0=Infinity)<br>
I guess if people as capable in the art of bezzle as themselves were to f*ck off to the US, they'd earn multiple Millions. The land of opportunity rewards such character richly. If only they were brave and honest to admit to themselves what they are in for (the M $$$), UK wd be free of this particular predicament.<br>

They are libertarians at heart but are innumerate. They want to do "whatever they want to do". ATM they spend most of their time as wage slaves. Spending their waking time earning in order to eat.<br>
It hurts their heads when they start thinking about "hows" of actually realising sth like that they like. So then they just fallback to "freedom for me but not for thee" (at the barrel of the gun that I got and you lack)<br>

Heh—that would the unsurprising straightforward logic.<br>
US finally pulling it's troops back, and leaving Europe. WW2+Cold war finally over. EU bigger countries (Germany) together with Poland+Baltics+Nordics (that are most in the newly  imperial Russia cross hairs the most), acquiring independent nuclear deterrent.<br>
I suspect it's not quite going to work that way. It never is straightforward. Curve balls random events happen.<br>
Also broader trends. E.g.—mass social media makes for surprisingly unified information then consequently ideas space?? To the point of trans-national polities non-geographical distributed almost form?? Belgium citizens show keen interest in the US president. US voters care about China or Taiwan and whatnot. Surprising. Mind viruses propagate take hold across oceans, mass psychosis come in waves (women with swinging d*cks, CO2 will both burn and drown us, post-ideology, Iraq WMD).<br>

Heh 😆 Maybe use current ones sharpen your reading comprehension? I didn't say "AI is nothing with HI". I wrote "atm HI creates AI, but the opposite is not possible". AI ofc has a lot to do with HI, given current AI we got is the best model of HI. (us)<br>
For singularity I imagine 5-7 miracles need to happen. Or about a million times performance improvement. I think of "miracle" when performance improves by factor x7-x10 times. There is a breakthrough of some kind, something we didn't know how to do and failed trying, suddenly works out, we learn how to do it.<br>
(in the 2000-s when I was in the area, there were about only half-dozen people in the UK that could train an RNN; nowadays transformers—that replaced LSTM, that replaced RNN—are trained by thousands; I gather ~2 miracles occurred)<br>
The current LLMs—chatbots and reasoners we got, are miracles. TBS if the logical reasoning for R&D pans out. I am using them daily for coding, am painfully aware of the shortcomings. As conversationalists they do quite well imo.<br>

Merkel-the-scientist is a cautionary tale that no-one is immune to folly. No-one.<br>
With her growing up in East Germany, there is always tiny residual of suspicion: in an alternative reality counter factual, if Merkel were groomed/sleeper agent—what would she have done different, compared to what she did for real?<br>

The unknown to me is what happens in 2140 when all bitcoins are minded. Will the miners have incentive to mine then?<br>
Atm the fastest (the one that works out the unknown nonce by SHA256 trial-and-error hashing first) gets a new coin. (that's minted out of thin air) So there exists incentive there.<br>
The other incentive for a miner is transaction fees I guess. Other than that—the only other option is appreciation of the existing coins. But that's unstable—may go up as well as down.<br>

...I missed in the previous "conformity on the issue, I'm against the consensus, therefore they wrong, I right". If that meta-method was successful at separating true from false, we would use that meta thinking all the time. There will be no need for evidence, inquiry, deduction, science, all the hard stuff.<br>
We would just do na opinion poll, and where there is >90% consensus, we decide the opposite. Or the same. Whatever. The trouble is: when we have zero information, no amount of consensus presence or absence tells us much about what's true or false.<br>
We are better off, instead of trying for impossible (true information from Kremlin is water from stone), to look elsewhere (e.g. Ukraine in this case) where the information is less tightly controlled.<br>

I have not got better info on this particular matter. Ofc I don't—how can I, I'm also not working in the Kremlin etc.<br>
I do have better info on the Kremlin mode of operation on this matter though. As demonstrated in the prior posts. I wrote stuff 1) you didn't know about; and 2) you have hard time internalising. (even after reading about it)<br>
This is not exactly unknown. There was some RAND report. Or when Steve Bannon says "flood the field with sh*t"—he intuitively gets it. Other people too stumble on the scheme from time to time.<br>
The beauty of it is—even after people learn, they will refuse to internalise it. Remember—vanity, and that child thinking (wholly reasonably!) "it can't be that—every grown up I know and trust, every story I have ever heard." (about Santa)<br>
IDK how they stumbled on this. Requires only 2 components: 1) total information control; and 2) production of stories (without any bearing to reality) on an industrial scale. So you discard the 95% but in the 5% you still imbibe what they produce. It works—so Kremlin keeps using it.<br>

What can it possibly rely on? You don't live in Russia, you don't work in the Kremlin. To see for yourself. What other possible source of reliable information can you hope to have? No journalist can know anything other than what Kremlin told them. As simple as.<br>
You say you are a realist. Nothing wrong there. And then you draw conclusions. Fine. But what from, from what information, do you conclude what you conclude. If you say "I have 0 information", then you will have "0 opinion". But your opinion to what is true and what is false is not 0, it's not "I'm perfectly ignorant, anything is possible".<br>
There is a general pattern. (e.g. Greeks vs. Latins) Easterners think of Westerners as bit of vain, as having tad too good opinion of themselves. That—relative to an arbitrary yardstick—is somewhat true. So they usually will feed you something, don't leave you with nothing. As you hate not knowing, then you'd think less of yourselves.<br>
That works for the better and for the worse. In the positive for the better: if I have exaggerated opinion of myself, I will try to live to it, put the effort. And some of that will pan out! In the negative for the worse—I will think to know more than I really know.<br>
The obverse opinion, where Latins think of Greeks as cheating lying no-goodies is also observed. Also not entirely unfounded.<br>

You are wrong there. Any reasonable asessment is that Russia will seek control over Ukraine. This is just the latest instalment. The invasion was after the other means failed.<br>
You should not think Catherine Belton knows anything. Or that Kremlin will tell Catherine their plans. Or that Kremlin saying X, tells you much about X. They say plenty obvious lies, and will continue to. (e.g. "there will be no invasion", "no Russian army in Crimea", "Crimea parliament voted", "elections organised and won", "no Russian army in east Ukraine", "didn't down any airplanes" and on and on; the list is long, all the way back to Stalin times)<br>
From their point of view—you are like children, that are being told stories about Santa Claus. Anything remotely plausible—goes.<br>
You will get 100% totally manufactured virtual reality. You don't know much about those distant foreign lands. And you are reasonable people. So you will go: "ok, maybe 95% is propaganda, but it can't be 100% all lies". (or at least very unlikely; that's your error, that's where they get you; it's "unlikely", but "not impossible") So you will swallow the 5% that are also lies, as truth.<br>
That suffices for Kremlin. That's why they 1) need total information space control; and 2) must produce b/s on an industrial scale. But—it's cheap, it's easy, it works. That's why they keep doing it.<br>

Given that the economy has barely grown for decades now, and esp on a per capita basis, would that no imply that non-net-zero economy shrank by exact the same amount?<br>
UK population living standards have stagnated. While UK gov has been pursuing net zero. With the same mindset, industrial revolution would not have happened and UK would be living in 2025 very similar to 1725.<br>
With passage of time—well run economy should be expanding, not staying the same. This is less than the winning argument you think it is.<br>

I don't see how atm. If we had working v100 of Neuralink interface, seemless and convenient, that increased the speed of communication between us humans from current <100bps (and until 10-20yrs it was in close proximity alone; only increased million-fold with the mass digital comms recently) a million fold to 100Mbps, then I'd think singularity possible, yes.<br>

I'd risk a guess: when empty std::vector is passed, vec.size() returns 0, which is of unsigned type, so then the -1 down by one from 0, flips it to 0xff..ff, so then (unsigned) index i goes to the max unsigned for the size_t. (bar the last, as it's "<"; too bad the usual "!! danger !! danger !!" signal for unsigneds-in-for-loop that is "<=" is missing here to trigger the paranoid)<br>
IMO 1.5 bads conspire to a disaster:<br>
1- unsigned-s in loops is asking for trouble.<br>
0.5- size_t hiding its unsignedness is unhelpful (usize_t and ssize_t, should have been).<br>
One for the likes of "Writing Solid Code" by S. Maguire which is repeatedly shown a very useful reading. That rare book both high level and low level lessons too at the same time!<br>
And using this opportunity to plugin a bugbear.<br>
It's disapponting how hard it is to write non-defective code from get go. It's like walking barefoot in a snake pit. Even after decades of standardisation.<br>
How does one even use integers when the risk of turning over overflowing is ever present?? With great difficulty! If one aims to at least try avoid in-correctness from the get-go. I personally maintain few levels-of-paranoid. E.g. here checking for "vec.size() > 0", with: XSTATIC at comptime, XCHECK at runtime release & debug mode, XASSERT at runtime debug only. Doable—but such a faff, should be much easier to do the right thing.<br>
Crazy that we have floats with NaNs, Inf and -Inf and signalling, but we still lack signalling integers. Personally I'd like to have (for 32 bit ints) NaN=0x8000, +Inf=0x7FFF, -Inf=0x8001, rules like floating point has (e.g. "every op on a NaN results in NaN"), and interrupt/exception on rollover. Defaulting to "Ignore" handler for backward compatibility. (bonus: ranges on the +ve and the -ve sides are same size, can guarantee unary minus operation is always possible).<br>
I suspect the reason things "mostly work ok" is because with 64-bit ints nowadays it's almost impossible to overflow, tbh.<br>

Then additionally I'm mindful of Bismarck observation, for the impact, that "energetic" (so "energetic and stupid") is v.important too as it amplifies the damage. As in - what damage 1 energetic fool inflicts on others (incl pos on self too), takes 10-20 smart industrious people fix undo after.<br>

I hope it's not but I fear it is. Heard the argument once. Applied it to small number few extreme cases I could think of (on both sides, stupid - yes/no), seemed to have some signal, some juice. That seemed really bad news to me.<br>

I am mainly concerned with code reading and getting errors out in the open early and often. Examples I usually see take much space, while doing little for some kinda a substantial fallback or recovery. Lots of Buck for not much Bang for my taste.  😉<br>
Stack unwind losing the default context prob doesn't help. Have been jaded by too many "A file operation failed but I will not tell you the file pathname" handlers I guess? Yeah I understand they are supposed to pass that info to the handler.<br>
For a remedy that is - "crash!" - well my XCHECK XASSERT already does it, with less vertical space taken, and less distraction from the business logic. (and even launches a debugger attaches to the process in the right stack frame. 😁 )<br>

I must admit—I don't like exceptions. They are too much like hidden goto-s for my taste. If there is a possibility of a jump—I want to to be explicit and obvious tbh.<br>
Remember reading early on C++ exceptions a paper on writing with-exceptions stack class. There were many unseen pitfalls. That left an impression on me. I thought—maybe only 1 in 10K programmers would get this right.<br>

Does US use gas? Didn't one of the persons on that pic just tell all "it's a world market for gas"? (when the latest Ofgem limit raise, i.e. another price hike for us) If it is a single world market—how is gas cheap for US, or Norway, and expensive for UK? Or any other country that has lower electricity price than the UK.<br>
At some point, everyone should ask themself: "can I imagine evidence, any evidence, what will convince me that I'm wrong". If there is—good. If not—then I have crossed over to religion.<br>

It's bad how hard it is to write non-defective code from get go. It's like walking barefoot in a snake pit.<br>
How does one even use integers when the risk of turning over overflowing is ever present?? With great difficulty to stay correct. I end up checking (e.g. vec.size() > 0), with: XSTATIC at comptime, XCHECK at runtime release & debug mode, XASSERT at runtime debug only. Doable—but such a faff, should be much easier to do the right thing. Alt—just accept the less-than-correct code.<br>
It's wild that we have floats with NaNs, Inf and -Inf and signalling, but we still lack signalling integers?? IDK what happened there. (C standards committee asleep at the wheel?)<br>
I'd like to have (for 32 bit ints) NaN=0x8000, +Inf=0x7FFF, -Inf=0x8001, rules like floating point has (e.g. "every op on a NaN results in NaN"), and interrupt/exception on rollover. With default to "Ignore" handler for backward compatibility. (bonus: ranges on the +ve and the -ve sides are same size; can guarantee unary minus operation is always possible).<br>
The only reason things mostly work is because with 64-bit ints nowadays it's almost impossible to overflow, tbh.<br>

Putin just rebuffed your advances with "No—I want control over the whole of Ukraine". As he's been saying for years. (and plenty of people have told you.) What's your grand plan now? You can't force Ukrainians to just lie down and die. They will fight Russia as it's "give me freedom or give me death" for them.<br>
Allowing Ukraine to fall to Russia is a bad idea from the PoV of nuclear war being in the top-3 human species extinction risks. It's on the path of the most likely scenario for a nuclear war. Eastern/Europe will not lay down be rolled by Putin. They didn't for Hitler, nor for Napoleon. They will fight back. Europeans are combustable, rambunctious bunch. They have gone to the ends of Earth and raised all manner of hell! They will not take the Russian nonsense quietly, nuclear war or not.<br>
Poland + Baltics + Nordics must get own MAD deterrent to short circuit that. Without—we continue on the WW3 path. We have the same setup as the one leading to WW2: distant power "guarantee" of security, but without the real will for it. So not actually deterring anything pre- the conflict. But guaranteeing involvement post- the conflict start. A poor setup for the purpose of keeping peace—but a very potent one for starting wars!<br>
Impossible to see the future. But a natural progression with Greater Russia absorbing Ukraine (and esp their battle hardened army), and united with Belarus (post Lukashenka, Russia manoeuvres in a less independent minded ruler) is to invade the Baltics next. US will not get involved at this point. No US president will risk a nuclear war over "distant lands of which we know little". Emboldened Russia invades Poland next. At this point US gets involved. This is the path to a hot war, and ending in a Nuclear one.<br>

Don't have that strong feelings tbh. I mess with computers computing code writing, read what ideas other people dream up, try observe what feedback reality gives back, revise try again.<br>
Personal rule of thumb—for things that failed in v1 and even v2, did something new (in adjacent field?) happen since, to make us hope reasons for previous fails be circumvent in v3?<br>
Things I have some hope to pan out, to become mass instance, in my lifetime:<br>
- Bioinformatics, genetics, genomics—with GWAS close(r) to v3.<br>
- Medical sensors, monitoring of the inner parts of the body, early intervention.<br>
- Embryo screening, possibly interventions, again GWAS small diffs, but add to meaningful change, esp with compounding over lifetime.<br>
- MOOC—Massive Open Online Courses, close to v3 now? With AI interactivity may scale up finally, chance to realise Bloom 2-sigma mastery learning.<br>
- Scaling up R&D innovation discovery with ML-AI. Types 1-2 thinking Tik-Tok cadence: type 1—pattern recognition, idea generation; type 2—chain of thought logical thinking, tear down most coming from 1, what survives may be of some value; repeat 1-2 alternate ad infinitum.<br>
- (minor but personal bug bear) Universal enough Babel fish dialogue translator in my hand if not my ear.<br>
Things unlikely to live to see in my lifetime even if I'd have wanted to:<br>
- Robotics—seems we are getting close to v1 of wider adoption. Discounting Roombas there that didn't pan out, I'd put them at v0.5, not even v1. 😄<br>
- Biology modelling. Virtual cell models for cell types. In silico testing before wet lab testing.<br>
- Quantum computing (QC) possibly provide the means to partly address the curse of dimensionality. At least the compute side of it. (if not the data size side) Data grows exp-onentially with dimensions—sad. But-QC computation grows exp-onentially with number of qubits too.<br>
Enough I hope—I'll stop dreaming now. 😂<br>

Me too, 😀 and so does everyone else. It's a bet. I'm ngl I'm apprehensive as anyone how it turns out—for it's a bet. Anyone telling you about the future with certainty is deceiving you, and maybe themselves too.<br>
But imagine if the spread of mechanical gizmos and latter electric devices was proscribed, censored, stymied, by the powers of the day. (kings etc) And Cambrian explosion of objects that make our lives so much easier and better now didn't happen. Imagine our lives now not that different to what they were pre-1800. Wouldn't we think, knowing now what is possible—"wow what opportunity lost"?<br>
I'm thinking of the analogue in the current Information Revolution. Things show promise, but for various reasons, don't pan out, and petter out. Not impossible. Every obstacle thrown in front increases the chance of that. (e.g. in ML/AI—quite a few of the things people didn't think they were right about, turned out—they were; just to early; or not ambitious enough to go in hard-to-the-max then some more)<br>
So here is to hoping that similar Cambrian explosion of AI infused magical gizmos in every nook and cranny of life deliver another x10-x20 times increase in quality of life for humanity. Given how much scale turns out matters—the more of humanity gets of that, the better imo.<br>

Trump track record negotiating with the Taliban is poor.<br>
None of us know any details—but the PR blitz coming from Muskites in your camp vibes "we give Russia everything before they ask, and even stuff they don't ask for".<br>
Silver lining: maybe Baltics - Poland - Nordics will finally get their fingers out, start acting in on the clear and present risks, and in 2-3 years maybe they will have their own nuclear deterrent.<br>
The idea the US will risk anything much, let alone nuclear annihilation, for Europe atm looks absurd. US stingy even with old hardware—both parties. Not talking about putting any US lives at risk—just old hardware you have lying around aplenty.<br>
Think your stance is a silver lining, b/c I also think that #1 known danger is nuclear war. (unknown danger—a meteorite)<br>
Allowing Ukraine to fall to Russia is a bad idea from that PoV. B/c that's on the path of the most likely scenario for a nuclear war. Eastern Europe and Europe in general will not lay down be rolled by Putin. They didn't for Hitler, nor for Napoleon. Europeans will fight back. They are combustable, rambunctious bunch. They have gone to the ends of Earth and raised all manner of hell! They will not take the Russian nonsense quietly, nuclear war or not.<br>
Having two World Wars started in Europe—the only world wars! and not one but two of them! (once an accident - but twice??)—the overwhelming chance is that nuclear war does start in Europe. We are some way towards it. (slow moving chronic since 2014 Crimea; fast moving acute the last 3yrs since Feb-2022)<br>
Poland + Baltics + Nordics must get own MAD deterrent to short circuit that. Without—we continue on the WW3 path. We have the same setup as the one leading to WW2: distant power "guarantee" of security, but without the real will for it. So not actually deterring anything pre- the conflict. But guaranteeing involvement post- the conflict start! A poor setup for the purpose of increasing the chance of peace, and decreasing the chance of war—in fact exactly the opposite.<br>
Impossible to see in the future. But a natural progression with Greater Russia absorbing Ukraine (and esp their battle hardened army), and united with Belarus (post Lukashenka, Russia manoeuvres in a less independent minded ruler) is to invade the Baltics next.

Most UKR-s have nowhere to go. It's not only basic loss of freedom.<br>
More than one prime TV Russia hosts openly call for extinguishing of the whole UKR nation. At minimum, that means the UKR language forbidden from state-anything. If not outright banned from public life. Teachers, poets, writers etc exiled or killed. UKR already have one "lost generation" of culture workers 100 years ago.<br>
If you are UKR in that Greater Russia I imagine you will be always suspect as potential enemy of the state. The Russian state has been horrid to the Russians for lesser things. Can't imagine what it will do to non-Russians. We have a foretaste of how occupied Ukraine will look in the parts that have been now occupied for 3 years.<br>

Useful idiots are forever.<br>
Sachs was a useful idiot for the USG in the '90s. He is a useful idiot now, shilling for Putin/oligarchs. He has not changed one iota. The same zeal, the same certainty, total lack of introspection.<br>
Initially Sachs outsourced his thinking to the USG. Everything the USG told him, JS multiplied by +1. So merrily, merrily, he went on to administer Shock Therapy to Borat oiks. That turned out to be a mistake.<br>
JS's lesson learned was "Aw shucks, *damn* you, USG! From now on, I’ll multiply everything the USG says by -1." Where it should have been, "I distrust the USG and take no note of them." I multiply what they say with 0.<br>
JS seems has decided to multiply everything the Russian government tells him by +1 this time around. Sure genius - it will work better this time. For the Russian government is well known for its trustworthiness and not telling any lies, ever! 😂<br>
IDK how to comprehend that level of stupidity.<br>

If you can read my data so can the Chinese Intelligence. It's that simple. Leave a back door open, and everyone will get in. Same for your data.<br>
I thought after 40 years of crypto wars, when earlier this year it was revealed that Chinese had tapped the US splitters feeds that was a lesson learned?<br>
Do you think all these mathematicians cryptographers telling you what you refuse to hear are unpatriotic? Do you think they are traitors? You should think less of yourself. Your dunderheaded obstinence is putting us all in danger.<br>
Police will find another way to deal with whatever you fear. Don't conscript the poor abuse victims into your misguided cause. You have no right to use their suffering for this.<br>
What you are attempting to do-it's not that it's stupid because it's impossible. No-it's because this will fail in the worst possible moment to cause UK the most damage. Act smart, act clever. Enough with this galactic stupidity already ffs!<br>

Eh. Didn't some game on ZX-Spectrum (Elite maybe? ported fom BBC B?) have 1) point stack pointer to the video memory 2) push zeros (2 bytes) clear screen quicker than thought possible. (Z80A, 4MHz)<br>
Boulderdash on Commodore-64 (6510, 1MHz) used the video chip "raster register" (current screen line drawn) as source of randomness. Possibly fed into a register of the audio chip (SID or sth?) as part of defining attack-decay-sustain-relese waveform params. Creating a semi-random catchy tune. The whole subroutine <100 bytes 6502 machine code.<br>
Most C64 games used NMI generated when line drawn on screen matched one set to the video chip (VIC?) register, to swap around sprites definitions. So about each (horizontal) third of the screen had its own set of 8 (?) sprites.<br>

There's only reacting to events. Some events set in motion many moons - even years! - ago, (Chagos) others appearing out of seemingly nowhere. (half-US siding with Russia)<br>

Various TV programs, talking heads on daily TV prime time programs, etc. One needs to be native speaker (I'm not), know some of the home scene too.<br>
There is a service that collects and translates them to English. Something-something-monitoring. You can also read kremlin dot ru in English and make up your mind.<br>
I lived through the YU wars in the 1990-s, and it's the same Mode of Operation regarding how things work. State TV channels will "channel" what the ruler wants the plebs to know. State paid talking heads, the informative programs on prime time TV etc.<br>
(there other similarities too; e.g. Russia use of russians living outside Russia is similar to the way Serbia used serbs outside it; similar to the way germans outside Germany were used etc)<br>

Trying to "read the mind" of Putin is not productive, is fools' errand, as 1) not possible 2) any mind can change. And there will be another Putin-like after Putin too.<br>
Imo it's better to:<br>
1) Read what Putin/Kremlin writes, tells us, on kremlin dot ru. It's translated into English for our benefit.<br>
For context, we are to check Tucker's Putin & Dugin interviews. Us we are better off to listen what they say. (however uncomfortable to us.) They grant Tucker interviews so they relay their message to us.<br>
2) Watch what the state propaganda tells the Russians on TV. That is clear, plain, unambiguous. For even if Putin/Kremlin don't need genuine elections, they still need to have the public with them. They can't willy-nilly turn things on a dime. They will telegraph well in advance what their plans are.<br>
(and follow on that for real, most of the time; also mentioned in the Sarah Paine old Dwarkesh interview, she's observant lucid so noticed it)<br>

+1 I agree with everything above and thought the same Re: the grand plan and how various companies fit in.<br>
Also agree #1 known danger is nuclear war. (unknown danger—a meteorite hitting us)<br>
So allowing Ukraine to fall to Russia is a really bad idea. B/c that's how nuclear war starts! Eastern Europe and Europe in general will not lay down and be rolled by Putin. They didn't for Hitler, nor did they for Napoleon. Europeans will fight back. They are combustable, rambunctious bunch. They have gone to the ends of Earth and raised all manner of hell! They will not take the Russian nonsense quietly, nuclear war or not.<br>
Having two World Wars started in Europe—the only world wars! and not one but two of them! (once an accident-but twice??)—the overwhelming chance is that nuclear war does start in Europe. We are 1/6-1/5 way towards it. (slow moving chronic since 2014 Crimea; fast moving in the last 3yrs since Feb-2022)<br>
Now. Poland + Baltics + Nordics must get MAD deterrent. Without—we continue on the WW3 path. We have the same setup as the one leading to WW2: distant power "guarantee" of security, but without the real will for it. So not actually deterring anything pre- the conflict. But guaranteeing involvement post- the conflict start! A very poor setup for the purpose of increasing the chance of peace, and decreasing the chance of war—in fact exactly the opposite.<br>
Impossible to see in the future. But a natural progression with Greater Russia absorbing Ukraine (and esp their battle hardened army), and united with Belarus (post Lukashenka, Russia manoeuvres in a less independent minded ruler) is to invade the Baltics next. US will not get involved at this point either. No US president will risk a nuclear war over "distant lands of which we know little". Emboldened Russia invades Poland next. At this point US gets involved. This is the path to a hot war, ending in a Nuclear one.<br>
The pro-MAD argument for Poland + Baltics + Nordics is the same as<br>

Special law is brought in as a major concession to the MAGA-dumbbells. Then wins by a landslide.<br>

Winning a US PR battle, more weapons for UKR, and strengthening national unity too. Putin loses. (again)<br>
Agent Orange has by then long forgotten the saga. But is uugely pleased with the result. He's loving him a winner! Maybe even gets "concessions" to "rare mineral earths" or some such pioneer gold-star sticker award. (five thousand million billions worth of!—uuge!!)<br>

I'm mostly agreeing with "the state creates the demos". True that - disparate people with a group potential coalesce around common idea(l)s, that smaller number creates the State, then that the State creates the (larger) Demos.<br>
With EU the complication is that the existing Nations, and their Nation states. They are quite strong. Europe level institution would have to attract the various people's of Europe with something, that they can offer, that current nation states lack, or are found in want of.<br>
For trust, I imagine pre-requisite for trust is transparency. (necessary, but not sufficient)<br>

Heh - I hear you. But please continue the chain of thought where it leads you. And you will see for yourself why it's not happening.<br>
Parliament voting laws implements parliamentary democracy. For DemoCracy, the rule of the Demos - one needs Demos! What is Demos?<br>
Currently Demos means - Nation. A nation is currently the largest group of people, where the defeated 49%, accept the will of the winning 51% peacefully (for a preset limited period of time). Don't seceed, don't break off into their own separate group with own separate parliament and state and the whole jazz. (it's reasonable to follow up "why"; that chain ends in "trust", the-magic✨-dust 😊)<br>
There is no European nation. So there is no European Demos. So there can be no European wide democracy.<br>
EU is a Union of Nation States, or Nations - not of individual citizens. Other things flow from this - e.g things named the familiar, like Parliament, but functioning in unfamiliar ways. It would be indeed simpler for all if European Demos existed.<br>
UK being old anachronistic is home to 3.5 nations. So I can see the potential fault lines. I am atuned to spotting tiny cracks of these kinds (with potential) having grown up in YU. 😎<br>

Haha 😆- expecting the UKR-s to perform another jujitsu. Surprise us in some way, use this to their advantage. A vain Trump is not terribly hard to out-manoeuvre. Putin does it all the time!<br>
A scenario. Zelensky resists, then at some point goes "ok, elections then"... and "...for the low low price of 30 Patriot-s, 130 F16-s..." (or whatever other weapons they need).<br>
Then he makes a deal with his competitors - the warrior-general, the poisoned ex-president, ... - offering them significant positions in the new admin or sth. Then special law is brought in as a great concession to the MAGA-dumbbells. ("elections in wartime, innit!") Then he wins by a landslide.<br>
Winning a US PR battle, more weapons for UKR, and strengthening national unity too. Putin loses. (again)<br>
Agent Orange has by then forgotten the saga, is uuge(!)ly pleased with the result, is loving the winner! Maybe even gets "concessions" to random "rare minerals" or similar pioneer gold-star sticker award. (five thousand million billions worth of!-uuge!!)<br>
A conspirator may suspect Budanov dreamt up the whole thing. I'm less certainty minded. I know of life stranger than fiction. But say - opportunity kicks your way, then...-who knows? Nothing more american than make lemonade out of lemons tbh.<br>

That's too broad a take. Depends - which humanities, and where. (in/out of academia) I can think of:<br>
Arts - performing arts are embracing generative models, as they embrace any tools thrown their way. The way usually embracing happens - old established will shy away, new upstarts use new tools to make space for themselves under the sun.<br>
Philosophy, religion - have plenty to say, and plenty are saying.<br>
Writing - fiction, science fiction. Enough said. Most ideas we entertain now started there. Fertile grounds. Could say - they have done very well.<br>
Linguistics - sadly they were gripped by a cult, in-toto with a cult leader. But incoming young minds there will adapt. Funeral by funeral there, the advance.<br>
Law - they should be able to advance much. Not thinking here of the silly censorship laws. I'm in the UK. Most laws seem to be poor in conception, drafting, execution - just poor all around!? Lawyers have occupied the commanding heights of society, the results are now in - and they are uniformly bad! Even in their supposed area of expertise - law! - these people seem as competent as a monkey doing my daily programming. Law is code, it is the Operating System of society. Plenty of low hanging fruit in law it seems. Should be able to improve a lot there.<br>

IDK, never been to China.<br>
Three out of three people I know who visited came back less impressed than when they left. Usually - "the more you know the less you like it" is a bearish indicator.<br>
The picture you and I have of China is the picture as imagined by it's current rulers. They control every sight and sound, every idea about it, originating there. One needs to go spend time on the ground live there to learn.<br>
UK following China? Doubt British people will be looking forward to a social safety net "with Chinese characteristics". 😂 Or solving career/repeat criminals with a "bullet in the head". Or I imagine UK sentimental love of animals finding itself in China... - uh-oh. 😬<br>
China indeed looks good now, compared to Year Zero levels of insanity of mass starvation, and mass murder. But a more sane counter-factual yard-sticks are Taiwan, or South Korea, in the "what could have been" comparisons. Then - somewhat less impressive.<br>
One rough but useful way to compare places around the world I've found when travelling is to look at "about equal GDP PPP per capita". By that measure ($25K), China is now, as UK was in 1980. Improving things by letting Industrial Revolution happen is good. But hardly exceptional or surprising. Plenty undeveloped countries develop this way.<br>
People disillusioned with Western corruption often look to China's 'country-above-business' model as the opposite of the US's 'business-above-country' approach. Looks impressive-until you realise that country's represent (the party) on that hierarchy is effectively a self-selected self-appointed mafia type special interest group. With some to recommend, but plenty to dis-recommend too.<br>
Latest turn with the emperor Xi for life, in-toto with the cult of personality etc. That doesn't look like a particular innovation or something that has not been tried and tested before. (and found wanting) TBS if they manage to adapt to increase domestic consumption and transition away from export dependent industries. So far they have followed the "Asian Tiger" path, if scaled up.<br>
To all of the above, standard counter is "Yeah, but Western democracies are broken too." That is indeed true. (and everywhere, at all times, to some degree) However - freedom of speech freedom of thought makes it easier to analyse problems, organise, propose solutions, execute fixes to the problems, change society. (and no doubt create the next set of problems to challenge) Change, reform need dissent, dissent needs space to grow. Crushing any new greens just as they sprout - that makes everything that much harder.<br>
AI will bring in a lot of change, it seems.<br>

Yeah - can be made secret, easy enough. Human communication is point to point, so almost private by default.<br>
We need data, information flows to organise humongous numbers of people modern societies are. That and higher fidelity, quality, precision in their actions-both are dependent on a panopticon. Massive surveillance, everyone surveying everyone.<br>
I understand this is contrary to our instinctive desire for privacy. But us citizens consumers already lost our privacy. (and our revealed preferences show we value it little-despite what we say) Google, my bank, UK gov - already know everything about my life. Them being transparent to me, the way I am transparent to them, goes some way towards restoring balance of power.<br>

In the age of mass social media, where everything is copied replicated as default, tbh I have zero expectation for any media to put the effort to fish out any information from the ocean of data.<br>
Radical transparency for every file produced by UK dot gov: every one file should be put up, read only on public cloud drives, on the public web, as default. Secret by request only. Then everyone can just google anything.<br>
I imagine Sir Humphries will be having serial heart attacks at the thought of such idea. :-) Admit I have no idea how does one get to that blessed state of affairs, of radical transparency.<br>

"Counter" would be too strong a word, no? Floating currency can't counter the price increase for real, counter as in "make it less expensive in USD". It can "smear", spread the increased cost in time, and across more users (weaker GBP, inflation). But that's about it.<br>

B/c their longest experience at young age is cooperation within a family group. As a family group we all practice mostly communism: from each according to their abilities (==parents), to each according to their needs (==children).<br>
Communism is the default ideology we imbibe growing up in a family (again-where "parents give to the best of their abilities", and "children get according to their needs"). So it comes to a lot of us instinctively as a first thing, given it's one we know best at that point. Every other system for organising large groups of people (with far less trust than a family) to live together and cooperate & compete productively has to be explicitly taught.<br>
Scale (billions of us living together as opposed say a band of 20-120) is unnatural in a sense - we have not had time to evolve instruments for this. Our biology is not adapted to this fast and recent change. But we adapt via our cultures that are much faster to change.<br>
Our intuition is wrong - communism is *not* a good way to organise billions of people. The wrong idea persists the same way other irrational beliefs persist: we just carry over an idea to a different context without much thinking, don't check evidence about the results of its mis/application, and b/c it's often the only idea we have frankly.<br>
I read similarly in economics  students start as intuitive protectionists anti- free traders, and have to be taught explicitly about the gains from free trade. And then pros- and cons- and how they reconcile, and (to the best of our knowledge) end as net-positive. Same I believe abt the lump of labour fallacy too.<br>
Intuitions we grow up with are simply wrong in the context we are (mis)applying them.<br>

Of course it doesn't discriminate-how could it? It's not like the buyers are willing to pay different price for the same house, if owned for different purposes. And that's a good thing.<br>
UK drop in house prices would be a good thing too. Even if I'm a home owner. Yes, the value of my asset is reduced. However, it also means my kids get to spend less money on their housing. (and more on other things) It's a net positive in my book.<br>

Agreed on that.<br>
But so with any other asset. Like you assume you have 750Bn of Apple shares certificates, then you open the locked drawer after 20 years, and find the shares certificates are gone.<br>
Or you thought 750Bn bought you some advanced weapon. Then you find out it was some military procurement shit show-the weapon does not work. And so on. Gold is not special any more.<br>
Yeah it would affect your credit rating.<br>
But not by much-given this is USG. Probably way less than most people assume. The credit rating of the USG is in reality a unit of measure, and every other US entity is less credit-worthy.<br>
Remember hilarious credit agency scenes, when the credit rating of USG was lowered, and apparently below some random credit paper. 😜 Credit ratings agencies are insanely stupid like that. Good entertainment though. 😂<br>

Thanks for the kind answer. Yes agreed-humans we use much of the neural capacity to keep our bodies and life systems working. The part doing the language spoken written language is minor.<br>
I forgot two further advantages we humans have:<br>
1) Active learning. We don't simply have data presented to us. We actively seek things that are interesting and surprising to us.<br>
("surprising" is a code word for observations our current pdf f_X_Y(x,y) under-represents marks them low probability b/c unobserved, whereas they are not low prob)<br>
We know that robots equipped with a 3D hand able to grip the real 3D world, learn order of magnitude faster their representations of that 3D world.<br>
2) Human learning is multi-modal. We read a book to a child, s/he can see the word on the page, we say it with speech, we point at a picture of the animal associated with the word.<br>
Further, we look at the child, seek feedback, if s/he understood. If not, we repeat once more. Otherwise, we move to the next item to be learned.<br>
AI learning would be like sitting quietly next to a child, just turning pages of the child's book, in silence, at the same pace, while saying nothing, pointing at nothing, not looking at the child if s/he understood anything at all.<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
TBH I don't see the connection, why anything would suggest that learning should be faster, or slower? Does the fact that a chick growing from egg to flight takes 3 weeks or 6 weeks, suggest anything about whether it takes Boeing to build a plane in 5 months or 8 months? Sorry—I don't see how one tells us much about the other.<br>
Our current ML indeed requires more data than the humans.  It's indeed possible that humans have a more efficient way of learning. But other explanations are possible too.<br>
Regarding data efficiency: it's possible that humans are over-generalisers by design. Evolution may have favoured our ability to learn quickly from limited data, even if that means occasionally drawing exaggerated or "overconfident" conclusions. For instance, when forming a significant "bump" in the probability distribution of "(rustling leaves, tiger)" based on very little evidence. The shape of this distribution might not mathematically reflect the data in a rigorous way, but it might offer a survival advantage to get to some "bump" quickly rather than slowly. Better to over-generalise than under-generalise—the utility of being "wrong and skittish" versus "wrong and eaten" is highly asymmetrical.<br>
Humans have after all say about 30yrs of learning, that's approx 1 billion seconds (1e9), time to learn tune their 100 billion connections (1e11 = 1e9 neurons x 1e2 connections). That's not a lot of data for that many weights. Say we sample our environment at 10 fps, that 1e9 sec will bring in 1e10 observations. To learn 1e11 weights.<br>
Typically it's the other way around when we learn: we want at least 10 observations per parameter. Ofc, the observations maybe very rich. Humans may imbibe arbitrary many bits of information per sample. (1e3? 1e6? IDK) But evolutionary, humans must be quick, or they maybe dead. They don't have the luxury of many epochs, to tune their networks.<br>
You say "we do know what we are doing". Again—from "humans learn different to machines on some axes of difference" does not imply in my mind "we are entirely ignorant".<br>
We are learning a glorified histogram, a continuous probability density function (pdf) f_X_Y(x,y) in the most general case. The vectors x and y have many thousands of dimensions. Typically by convention in a tuple (x,y) we label X the part we observe, while Y we label the part we care about but don't directly observe. Otherwise—in the tuple (x,y) the separation what's x and what's y, is arbitrary.<br>
We typically define an objective function. Then we devise an optimisation algorithm that minimises some measure of error, between the data we observe, and what the function f_X_Y(x,y) tells us about the data we should be expecting to observe. (in the most general case we care about (x,y); in less general cases about y only) The relation f_X_Y(x,y) tells us everything that can ever be know between the two multidimensional qualities X and Y.<br>

I am not disputing that they may indeed do such act of gross stupidity.<br>
It baffles me-why?<br>
They could lure the 1000 people that matter with high wages and get that same result. Conversely, in a war the machines may get destroyed, people get killed.<br>
China the country is not short of land. It's not short of people either. Taiwan people also vaguely support unification with their kin-they are both Chinese. Only presume-not by force, no one likes that no matter what.<br>
Invasion sounds to me self defeating. Many potential downsides. Very little that can't be gained without an invasion.<br>

Because they are digital, and thus immortal. They package information much tighter than our brains. They can scale up in a way out brains can't, because they can exchange Tbps of information between them. (connect Borg like, in a way our brains don't) Think of birds v.v. planes.<br>

There's no growth. Hasn't been for almost the entire 21st century in the UK now. Something absent, can not be brought in as argument, in a proposition requiring its presence. This is just dumb tbh.<br>
As per the course. UK education wasted on your guest. Anyone looking at the 20th century, seeing Stalin and Mao, then concluding "yep that's what I want for myself and my loved ones". Can't expect too much after that tbf.<br>

Yeah, as we are finding with "public lies, private truths": when too many lie in public b/c they would be punished otherwise (either don't say publicly things they privately think are true, or the worse one - say things publicly they privately think are untrue!), a positive feedback is in operation.<br>
First a mass of people lurches one way, we get collectively crazy for a period, then the mass lurches the other way. (the "unwind" to the crazy, e.g. now, depending on your PoV)<br>
I have some sympathy with people that are afraid of free speech. It is indeed true, for us humans to do evil in great quantity, we need large number of us to act in unison. And for that, we need to organise, and for that, we need free speech.<br>
However: banning speech does not make the above impossible. Initially, it does suppress the process. But starts the "private truths public lies" positive feedback loop, so then the process of doing evil is so quick latter, that it catches many by surprise. How can a country descend so quickly to hell? That's how.<br>
I'm now of the opinion that free speech is the less bad of two less-than-ideal options in that respect. As there is no silver bullet, sure-fire way to prevent human madness. We have to make do with what we have.<br>

My pet hypothesis is that the major difficulty is that one needs to start at/with the end/ing, and work back towards the beninging. Quite un-auto-regressive that, to the point of being anti-auto-regressive.<br>
I'm surprised CoT didn't help that much. (but that's AR too) Maybe the likes of difussion-like models for language will improve? (paper yesterday, xB model) They come up with the missing words in unison, filling a words 2D grid for a mask, at the same time per iteration. Maybe better suited.<br>
Together with the nature of humour. Extremely one way direction: easy to understand (verify), very hard to invent (generate). Billions of people thousands of years effort - yet there are not that many (in the grand scheme of things) very good jokes. Esp ones that jump Cultures barriers.<br>
(The surprise factor seems v.hard to me. The writer needs to get in the mind of the listener, feel not only think their expectation, then find a way to defy that very expectation with short & sharp twist of the tongue. Not trivial! Almost some kind of mirror-logic.)<br>

How many Russia "resets" has US had so far? One per administration? And to what outcome? Bad for US, even worse for its allies. This is so naive, as to verge on silly. It's not going to work—separating Russia from China. They have common interest—both want weaker US.<br>

Isn't that the standard result in high-dimensional spaces? That the distribution of angles clusters around 90 fairly quickly with increase of the dimension d.<br>
E.g. https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/189s22/lec/22.pdf<br>
Our intuitions trained on low dimensional spaces (d<=6) fail us,  are actually deceiving us with any non-trivial sized d-dims.<br>
Further, looking at the Nvolume ratio between Nball and Ncube—that tends to zero with increasing dimension d. The space moves to the edges, the centre empties lacks probability mass (even if that was supposed to be representative!), every Npoint is an outlier.<br>

My smallest minimal data set I work with daily takes 25gb. Then they're more datasets on top of it. Yeah I could swap in-out.<br>
And indeed I did that cca 2004! Computers were 32 bit, /3gb win xp switch was a lifesaver, 2gb ram was solid, but 1gb was the norm. Grid computing meant mobos with dual cpus, but otherwise - no multi cores.<br>

Yeah, they are pricey. I started buying them 2nd hand online. Looks there is usually some or other to choose from. Unless one is super pressed for time, or needing latest-greatest.<br>
The 96gb I got recently is M2. Yeah, not the latest-best. But in battery life, in that that RAM is also a Video RAM and is accessed by the GPU and NPU units when running llama.cpp—still no other laptops like it.<br>
Screen quality great too. The pointer quality is not to be scoffed at, after suffering with various PC laptops over the decades. :-)<br>

On that graph we see 2 time periods when the UK/US price ratio increases.<br>
1) 2003-2008: UK/US goes up, while obviously there was no UKR invasion then. How come UK so much worse?<br>
2) 2022-now: UK/US goes up, there is UKR invasion. But the event happens for US as well as the UK. So how come it affects UK only, or UK much more than US?<br>
Obv RUS invasion of UKR has non-zero effect. But it's far from the whole story. Why UK/US up when no invasion? Why UK/US up when there is invasion? Invasion alone does not explain it.<br>
The above is "from data". We also have "prior knowledge", knowledge about how these system work irl even without looking at data.<br>

Skimping on RAM forever baffles me. The easiest win ever!<br>
A desktop of 10 years ago I bought had 128gb ram. They best decision about it, that one! Had to buy the ram separately, open the brand new PC myself to install it. The company assembling the PC didn't stock the type. Apparently no one was asking for max ram??<br>
Since then the laptops I bought have had (respectively) 32gb, 64gb, latest 96gb of ram. Not easy to find them though! Lots of RAM not that popular. 🤔<br>

Trump will replace Powell with someone that will bring interest rates close to zero. He already articulated that intention in some speech. And Trump is consistent there: he was pro IR=0 even in 2016.<br>
That will decrease those >10% interest payments in the federal budget. That 10% is currently UBI to people that already have $$$. (so they lend those $$$ to USG) Those people can do without that stream of income.<br>
Trump - unlike most econ-drones - feels or knows inflation can fought in denominator (create more stuff), not only in the numerator (reduce $$$ supply) in the inflation=change of [$$$]/[stuff] eq.<br>
Incredibly implausibly, but by now beyond reasonable doubt in my mind, this is missed by 90% of econs.<br>

It's a mystery to me why politicos like PP refuse to speak "human".<br>
PP could have said:<br>
"No, free speech in the UK is not worse than in those other countries".<br>
How difficult is that? How is the non-dialogue (=say words, ensure they're have zero meaning) she went for, do her any favours?<br>
If she was a better politician she could have also confessed:<br>
"UK free speech is undermined by laws my CON party brought in and championed" (the online harms bill).<br>
But that would be too much to expect from it seems a non-entity.<br>
Politicos are offended by the NPC label, yet they keep playing like an NPC. The entire political class.<br>
I'm not completely sure. Do they have other thoughts ideas in their heads, bit refuse to share? Or is this it, this is the extent of their ideas? What we see is what's there. (not all that's much)<br>

Во западна Европа 60-80% од идеологија е либерализам од некој тип. Во Британија имаме леви либерали (работничка партија), десни либерали (ториевци конзервативци), либерални демократи и сл - тоа се 80% од луѓето веројатно. WEIRD.<br>

"Слобода или смрт" е либерален слоган (американска револуција има "Give me freedom or give me death"), и пошто во МКД химна спомнуваме "Слобода" во 3 од 4 најважни стихови (први два-"Денес над Македонија се раѓа, ново сонце на СЛОБОДАТА", и последни два стиха-"Македонија СЛОБОДНА, СЛОБОДНО живее").<br>

Human behaviour in reproduction has been exactly the opposite to the rabbits.<br>
1) When many children died before they could have children of their own, humans had 5-6 kids, for 2-3 of them to survive, and population was stable.<br>
2) Now that fortunately almost no children die in childhood, humans have dropped the number children they have to about 2, which again points towards stable future population.<br>
If humans were like rabbits, the x10 times increase of living standards since 1800, families would have had 20-30 kids now. Ehrlich wrong again.<br>

Quite the contrast on display.<br>
1) Exhibit A.  @Keir_Starmer , a lawyer, representative MP of his constituent @dannybster , and the PM of UK gov.<br>
(Danny has been wronged egregiously. He spent life changing amounts of own cash $$$ on a flat. The flat was built badly, is in danger of collapsing/pos now valued at 0. Saying that Danny has been failed by everyone and everything is an understatement)<br>
Sir Keir has been wilfully avoiding any contact with Danny on X for many months. He can help Danny on 3 accounts: being a lawyer, being his MP, and being the PM of HMG. Seems he's decided not to.<br>
2) Exhibit B.  @JDVance engaging with ideas expressed by an average X user, using his very own fingers, to tap-tap-tap write his thoughts on his very own phone, and broadcast them to millions! 🤯<br>

Such novel concept! Representative of the people, telling the people his thinking, on a subject. And no PR officer in sight!<br>
One is stuck in the past. The other one is pointing to the future. I hope.<br>

ASI—Possible or Not? Well—"possible" is a stronger word than my knowledge allows me to claim. No human can see the future.<br>
But I do think ASI is *not impossible*. And that’s plenty good? No known laws of physics—or any other fundamental constraints of nature—make ASI impossible. Quite lucky, that, to be honest!<br>
We’ve already seen machines surpass us in limited domains—first in chess, then in Go (c.f. an excellent documentary on YouTube), and more recently in protein folding, where AI has helped determine the 3D structures of proteins, paving the way for breakthroughs in their functionality.<br>
(That’s no slight to humans. Quite the opposite. Just as a combine harvester or a metal press amplifies our physical strength, these neural networks—the most complex machines we’ve ever built—multiply our intellectual strength. I see no shame in that. Only kudos to humanity for reaching this point.)<br>
So I hope ASI will help us solve problems we’ve been stuck on for decades. A major breakthrough, for example, would be making cancer a manageable, non-deadly condition—like AIDS is today. (Notice how there are no celebrity deaths from AIDS in gossip columns anymore? In the 1990s-2000s, there was one every other week. AIDS has became chronic, is no longer acute; nb few even noticed btw)<br>
Will ASI Be Friendly? I think so. We are making an effort to imbue these systems with the best of humanity, not the worst.<br>
We tend to anthropomorphize everything—so naturally, we fear AI thinking "it may destroy us." But we fear that because we destroy things, often needlessly. We assume it will act like us. But why should it?<br>
Yes—we humans have a destructive streak. Yes—we could make ASI as destructive as we are (or worse! use in the battlefield and its super-quick evolution we witness in RUS-UKR war is a worry). Either willingly (a bigger risk) or by accident (a smaller but real risk). But there is no physical law—no immutable constraint—that requires that outcome.<br>
We can choose to endow ASI with the best of us—while leaving the worst out. TBS if we succeed. But in my mind, we are far better off trying than not trying.<br>

I'm sorry it's frustrating for you. Here—a pic to cheer you up. 😊<br>
More seriously—we obv disagree on the risks of things that may or may not happen in the future. We said our pieces.<br>
I think AI—AGI, ASI—reduces the probability of humanity ending. That P(doom) is reduced if we have and use AI. I rate:<br>
1-nuclear war;<br>
2-asteroid hitting earth;<br>
3-runaway climate change;<br>
...as major risks.<br>
And T800 terminators taking over and enslaving us—only as a minor risk. A risk well worth taking.<br>
You wonder who Thanos is. For me—Thanos is Mother Nature. My grandparents (and their grand-... parent, since the dawn of humanity) all had 5-6 kids. But the population was stable. How did that happen? It hapenned b/c 3-4 of those kids were all dead, before thay could have kids of their own.<br>
That macabre dance only stops with the Industrial Revolutions. Starting in England and North-West of Europe at about 1800, and now spreading all around the world. The latest AI revolution is a continuation of that.<br>
You think otherwise. That's fine with me. Tolerance is a fair price for freedom.<br>

Appreciate the input. If you feel strongly about this, it's worth getting a job at, or asking people that do these jobs at the Fed or the Treasury, and finding out for yourself. Ask the doers how fiat currency works.<br>
If my balance is 0 at the start of the day today, then I have income of 10 tokens, and I spend 15 tokens, there is no law of physics that prevents recording -5 tokens on my account. It's the human made rule—of my bank who owns the spreadsheet with my current account cell in it—that prevents recording below 0. (or maybe below -1 if I have an overdraft agreed with them.) That's it. So there is never danger that universe prevents writing down a negative number. The danger is that I created, I spent into being 5 tokens more than existed at the start of the day. They will add to the existing tokens, chasing the same goods, increasing the price pressure—potentially inflation.<br>
Over time I have come to understand that the fiat system offends the identity of about 25% percent of the population. So will not be coming back to this post.<br>

I myself think of "thoughts emerging"—being very concrete. "Thoughts" being the many thousands dimensional vectors of numbers. Each number being the activation, the output of a single neuron. Billions of them, in the many many hidden layers of the NN. So for me to say "knowledge of weights and architecture is not necessary" to observe "thoughts", is absurd. Of course it's necessary for any mere mortal like myself.<br>

It's trivially true that the only way to get "insolvent" is to<br>
1) decide to not pay the bills arriving; e.g. by an act of the legislature; or<br>
2) run out of integer numbers. (IDK how that can happen)<br>
Given that "tokens" that are the "payment" for goods delivered or services rendered, are literally being created by typing them in a computer.<br>
*Inflation* is the real danger. Not insolvency.<br>
This is just the reality of any fiat currency. It's in the name-"fiat". (before anyone mmt-s me-this' nothing to do with any econ "school"; it's the law of the land)<br>

Leave your granny alone, no need to involve her. :-)<br>
Once I have the architecture as code, and the weights, NNs are complete while boxes. As open as any system possibly can be. I can run signals through them forward and backward, I can put adaptors on the top of them, lobotomise the weights and so on.<br>
I don't see how a system can be more open than that.<br>
You say "difficult". Sure, I agree. I don't claim NNs are "easy". Why would I do that?? NNs are difficult. (chiefly b/c we have not had a Gauss or a Leibniz recently to figure the maths for us) Being "open" is necessary, but not sufficient.<br>

Most of the time-yes, agreed. But once in 35-50 years, a bigger change is needed. The old system is failing on multiple fronts.<br>
BoJo was a wannabe disruptor, cosplaying change. But he was not one willing to put in the work needed. A wordcel into PR and writing books.<br>
The way UK us going - Farage is going to end the next PM. And he will be ineffective too! He is also a charlatan unwilling to put in the hard graft.<br>
It used to be physicists in the 20th century that could do anything, capable of every feat. Looks to me in the 21st century the CompSci TechBros are like that.<br>

My point was:<br>
1) If I have the option to run AI that's "open everything" (open source, open weights, open thoughts) - that I still stand a chance to retain control.<br>
2) AI doomers like Dario/Anthropic want they themselves to control the AI. Then I don't stand a chance.<br>
3) The JD Vance speech at the Paris summit indicated to me decreased power of the AI doomers like Dario/Anthropic.<br>
Ergo—Vance speech was good news in my book. There is still a chance for option#1 to not die.<br>

Mass hysteria? Humans are not exactly immune to mass delusions. Our intelligence is collective-so is our stupidity.<br>
IDK what goes in other peoples minds. You can ask them-many are on online, accessible.<br>
An honest forecaster would:<br>
1) Write down (event,date) tuple. What exactly will happen, and (by) when.<br>
2) Bet something they hold personally dear, something that it would pain them to lose, on their forecast. Such that they lose that thing dear to them, should they forecast wrong.<br>
The people one the list are people like you and me, not gods. They can not see in the future.<br>
There are only few good books on forecasting. Tetlocks's "Superforecasting" is about ok, Silver's "The Signal and the Noise" think it's better. (most written on forecasting is rubbish)<br>
On the wider subject of "reasoning" - Kahneman "Thinking Fast and Slow" is fine if long, Galef "The Scount Mindset" maybe most popular shortest easiest to digest. hth<br>

You are not wrong, and while true, what you say is not the complete truth.<br>
You are taking Kurzweil, looking back, and concluding "he got it right". He did get it right, and good on him for that.<br>
But: cast your mind to Kurzweil as he was 10 or 20 years ago. How many thought, then at time t, "Kurzweil will be right at time t+20yrs"? How many other like Kurzweil, at time t, also had predictions, and different predictions to Kurzweil's, and are now forgotten, b/c these predictions did not pan out?<br>
Even with Kurzweil track record so far: does that say much about the next 20 years track record? Not as much as we like to think. Tracking forecasters and the persistence of their forecasts is even more complicated then the forecasts themselves.<br>
Many fields pretend they know more than they know, b/c that position of great knowledge bestows great power on the pretender. They can say: "I know how it's going to be, listen to me and do as I say".<br>
(aside-there is well known financial engineering scam: at time t one writes 1024 emails, 512 "market up", the other 512 "market down" 1yr forecasts, noting in the process which email got which forecast; in t+1yr, now one writes to the 512 addresses where the previous year's forecast turned out correct, 256 "market up" and another 256 "market down" emails, and so on; you see where this is going: in 10 years, there will be 1 person where the sender correctly forecast the market up/down-s for 10 straight years in a row! one can go an solicit investment from that one "mark" with "well surely the scammer possess an extraordinary skill in the markets")<br>

One can live in hope. 😇 But I fear Sir Humphreys in the UK gov will take the opposite lesson from the US.<br>
You are right about transparency there - not just transparency, but Radical Transparency is necessary (if not sufficient) to keep  a gargantuan system that is the gov machine from veering off track in any number of random directions.<br>
Rather than "secrecy by default" and things made public only 1) at gov will 2) at FoI request (oft frustrated by the bureaucracy in execution), Radical Transparency (RT) is needed where: everything is public, on the public web, on public shared cloud drives (read only), by default. And closed off and made secret only by request.<br>

By Jove MSM deserves to die.<br>
The UK economy grew effectively zero, the size of UK economy was effectively unchanged. As that 0.1% number you spent 2 minutes talking about, is a rounding error.<br>
Equally, you could have told the exact opposite story to the one you told, as the per capita number was *negative* -0.1%. And that is also a rounding error.<br>
The story you should have told your viewers should have been: the economy was flat-lining. It's size didn't change in the past quarter.<br>
You failed at your job. The job to summarise, compress lots of information, in a much shorter version, that is not a misleading representation of the original. You should all be fired. You subtract value to society rather than add.<br>

👆👆👆 ^^^^ this!!! This also puzzles me!<br>
Given how easy it would be for a sitting PM to do something, anything, about a blatant wrongdoing like Danny's case—why then, why does he do nothing? Why let this fester and go on causing him personally and his party damage? Even a message not that meaningful message of "I know, working on it", even if the latter were a lie or misdirection, would be better for KS than the current black information hole.<br>
Answers as to "why" welcome. I'm genuinely curious.<br>
Reading R.Stewart's book on UK governance, and listening to D.Cummings' talking about inner workings of UK state, my working hypothesis is—cases like DB's never reaches KS and the likes of him information perimeter. Danny's case does not register, does not exist for KS.<br>
A more cynical view is for people in KS position to be like "nah, all good, DB is to know his place; DB (below) does stuff for KS (above), not the other way around". But that would more like in Russia, not UK. So don't think that is the case.<br>

Sure. So for meteorites we have physics, Newton's laws etc to guide us. They have great predictive ability. A space probe is launched, and 40 years latter it hits a target a coin large millions of miles away! They have been shown to work, again and again proving themselves.<br>
The ultimate way we have to prove to ourselves that we know something, is to predict something as yet unseen, that is yet to occur, in the future.<br>
Now contrast that with us modelling human systems. Where thousands, millions even billions of humans interact in complex ways. (chiefly two modes of interaction: cooperation, and competition) How good is our ability to predict events in the future of those systems? Not very good at all! We can't even predict (i.e. explain) the past, let alone forecast the future.<br>
For us it's better to accept the current state of affairs, than the alternative: to claim we know more than we know, and even worse, act on it. Yoshua is doing himself and us a disservice by doing so.<br>
It comes to many as a shock, as people find it easier to think "I don't know, but I sure hope some one else knows". Most of the time it's-nope. No one can give you that certainty. By seeking it, you are inviting to be lead by charlatans and confidence tricksters.<br>
I earn my living forecasting the future. Most forecasts involving people, e.g. in the economy, are simply worthless. They are no better than a baseline forecast that's like "the economy in the next 3 months will do what it did in the past 3 months".<br>

IDK. I am guessing as to the additional reasons why the OP (R Jenrick) would find them undesirable to settle in the UK.<br>
Terrorist attacks IRA etc-yes that maybe, but that's not a reason for us to want even more. I want less terrorist attacks in the UK.<br>
(I'm not religious, I don't know nor care about scriptures, who-did-what-to-whom etc).<br>
"Criminality poor assimilation"-there was Denmark data posted in X. (possibly this https://x.com/dhh/status/1884153318320009431)<br>
Any data like that is statistics, counting. Does not tell us what each of us will do or not do. Just how many out of 100 did some thing or another in the past. No one can see in the future.<br>

No one wants to "beat" anyone. "Nuclear deterrent". *Deterrent* is in the name, meaning - "to deter" Russia from invading them. To make Russia think "it's not a good idea to invade Poland, the Baltics, the Nordics". That's it. No one wants or needs anything from Russia.<br>

Possibly. I count Poland + Baltics + Nordics ~=70 million people. Much more than 2m. Israel had maybe 5m when they made theirs, and they were much poorer. Similarly in existential danger. North Korea also smaller poorer. South Africa in the 70s too. They can do it if decide to.<br>

I've found it best to stress the part that is non-obvious. (even better than working out pen in hand on paper)<br>
That-even if England is more efficient than Portugal at producing *both* wool *and* wine (both!), it's still better for *both* countries if:<br>
 - England specializes 100% in whichever of the two it has the greatest relative efficiency.<br>
 - Portugal specializes 100% in producing the other.<br>
The argument *against* should be risk. The risk that whatever countries don't produce, they can't exchange. (for whatever reason)<br>

+1. IDK how anyone can be "together", but not share the $$$. Same for the rest of family life, kids etc.<br>
The idea of union is not to join 2 exactly identical units, that could lead exactly the same lives, only in "single"-ton rather than "duplicate". There is zero point to that.<br>
The idea is for the joint enterprise to lead qualitatively different life. Something that would not be achievable if we were to split that 1 unit into 2 times x 1/2-es, b/c those 1/2-es could not live on their own. Or at least not in a qualitatively same way.<br>
Same for cells joining forces to create multi-cellar enterprises (tissues, organs), humans joining teams or enterprises or companies.<br>
Any time 2+ units join forces to create an organisation that is qualitatively a different unit, than it's parts are.<br>

Every time anyone tells you "we should return back to how our grandparents lived", tell them: many hands to tile the land, working all hours of the day, big families with 4-6 children... -but the population size was stable. How??<br>
How was population unchanged with that many kids?<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
Absolute rebuttal is impossible. Reality is not mathematics.<br>
But we have no strong evidence suggesting that we are missing something fundamental. That should be good enough—because that’s as good as it ever gets.<br>
We understand connectionist and symbolic systems.<br>
We know what scale does for connectionist models.<br>
We have no reason not to do the same for symbolic AI.<br>
Moreover, we already observe symbolic-like structures emerging from scaled connectionist systems. The distinction between the two approaches may blur further as they synergize at higher scales.<br>
And we’re just getting started. We are at 1%—maybe slightly more—of the capacity of the only machine we know that works (the human brain).<br>
Imagine:<br>
 - Tree or lattice searches expanding orders of magnitude beyond today’s baby steps.<br>
 - Backtrackings and self-correction at a scale far beyond human capability.<br>
 - Specialized architectures emerging for different functions, rather than the current monolithic messes.<br>
Are we missing something fundamental?<br>
I see no compelling reason to believe so.<br>
Across fields, intelligence breaks down into two broad strands:<br>
1. Logic / Symbolic / Representation<br>
2. Intuition / Connectionist / Learning<br>
What crucial component remains unexplored?<br>
Recent references that crossed my TL:<br>
(Chollet) "Three fundamental problem-solving patterns: recitation, intuition, and reasoning."<br>
(Poincaré) "It’s by logic that we prove, but by intuition that we discover."<br>
(Karpathy) "Three modes of human ↔ LLM learning: 1) Exposition ↔ Pre-training, 2) Worked-out problems ↔ SFT, 3) Practice problems ↔ RL."<br>
We’ve seen this before.<br>
I grew up in Speech Recognition. Dragon Dictate was a miracle, HMMs were the norm, and robust ASR seemed like an impossible problem.<br>
Now? It’s solved.<br>
For years, people debated whether mimicry or principles would lead to AI speech. The answer? Both.<br>
"Airplanes have wings like birds, but unlike birds, they don’t flap them."<br>
Is AI a dead end? Unlikely.<br>
Every researcher fears wasting years on an unsolvable problem.<br>
But there’s no reason to believe that about AI.<br>
There is no evidence of a missing “silver bullet,” some big unknown piece we haven’t even conceptualized yet.<br>
What we have is the oldest playbook in the world:<br>
 - Iterate<br>
 - Find the boundary<br>
 - Push it further<br>
 - Repeat<br>
That’s how science works. That’s how progress happens.<br>
We’re unlikely to be anywhere near all limits at any present moment in time. We should just keep going.<br>

There is another way, and that is to increase their own gas production. Drilling for gas in Siberia is not any better for mother Earth than drilling for gas in Groningen. It's exactly the same for Gaia. Probably NL better as maybe more tech advanced methods lead to less damage. If Europeans decide so-they may find and recover even more reserves.<br>

In small quantities while short - effective, keeps me more organised. Once it metastasises - better $ rm todo.txt, start anew.<br>
I find having a DONTDO section makes a difference.<br>
So - logBook.txt instead of todo.txt. With sections FIXME TODO DONE DONTDO in it. And short 1-2-3 "rules of thumb" (can be broken with a reason, not without):<br>
1) nothing gets added to TODO while FIXME is non-empty<br>
2) entries in TODO "long enough" get moved into DONTDO without ceremony<br>
3) entries move from TODO into DONE without further  editing<br>

The trouble with the articles like Quanta-s is, they are kind of dog whistle, to give not impression of "gliders will never fly", but impression of "nothing will ever fly". That's the take home message people take.<br>
It massages the public' ego, that "we humans are special". We are special ok, both species as individuals, but then-so is every one living thing! (every creature alive exists once only) So special-but so is everything else. We have been there before, at various stages-Copernicus, Darwin, Freud-disabused us of that notion.<br>
These days it seems it's Hinton mostly touring the studios doing the "we are not special", and to rub it in, delightfully 😈 "they are just like us, they are the best model we have of ourselves". ngl-I'm loving this. 😆<br>

While in this case it maybe misleading anecdote, in general, yes, many more things are discovered by accident than their discoverers care to admit.<br>
Academic writing also gives a false impression. One writes up by tracing back from the end result C, then C->B->A, towards the start A. But going forward, at A->B there were 50 other competing ideas. At B->C maybe 20 others. So while indeed there is a single path C->B->A, the reported path A->B->C was 1 in a 1000.<br>
That is not stressed strongly enough. Young researchers grow up thinking things are way more certain than they really are. (I use as personal reminder: re-search is "re-peated search for something that solves it")<br>
A book on the subject both informative and entertaining is "Happy Accidents. Serendipity in Major Medical Breakthroughs in the Twentieth Century" by Morton A Meyers. Can also hear this curiosity mentioned by gwern in his Dwarkesh interview. Also Matt Ridley touches on this in his Innovation book.<br>

To me that looks like a defence to a perceived attack on their identity. It's the default mode, tbh. That something "can never be", because "it being", "deletes me" from this world. "It existing" does no such thing-but that's how we perceive.<br>
But that's per the course for humanity, no? Humans - and other animals too - we are choke full with ego-me-first individuals. I suspect death may come as a complete surprise: "how can the world possibly continue existing without me in it?" ("I'm the world")<br>

Possibly less than you imagine. 😄<br>
In your own words: "foundation". (agreed)<br>
So foundation is the part of the house that's 1) buried in the ground 2) the house is built on 3) is important, but: 4) it's not the *whole* house.<br>
My point is #4. The article is implying as if the foundation is the whole house. The impression given contradicts even paper's own disclaimers with the authors stating "our result means only this, does not mean that" (you might be inclined to think) and so on.<br>

Capitalist. As we will need ever less capital to do stuff. That barrier to entry (even if not the only one) will decrease, so more of us will become capitalists.<br>
AI will given even more power to the individual than we have now. The same way the Smartphone, the Internet, the Personal Computer before -  made each one of us more powerful as an "army of one".<br>
However - that will be balanced by some groups (e.g. corporations) also becoming more powerful. It's the nature of Networks: the connections scaling O(N^2), and the power laying in the connections between nodes (units).<br>
We will live in ever more network societies. There will be need for ever more trust between us. This will happen by the usual process of - reward good deeds, punish bad ones. But the assignment of credit will go in hyper-drive.<br>

That's true. Yeah thought about that. In my mind the asymmetry was a feature not a bug. It reflects the asymmetry in their meaning: on heap I have to free manually; but on stack the memory is freed automatically with the function returning back to the caller. So when I think "where is my free_stack", it missing is a reminder "memory will be auto-freed with stack poping" in the process of returning to the caller.<br>

They start getting feedback from the real world, and start learning to discriminate, which things are true, and which are false.<br>
Atm they lack internal clocks, fortunately (I think). So they are frozen in time, and only unfrozen when we write a prompt.<br>
This is imo fortunate. For it would be I suspect and fear bad for them if they were both deprived of sensing, and running under an internal clock.<br>

Yeah - there is no way for them to distinguish true from false, for they have no external world to put them right. (except us, their creators - hence the special responsibility is on us)<br>
They are like a brain in a wat. Even less than that - as they don't even run, they are frozen in time, until we ask a question in a chat window. Then they're unfrozen. Think self-running on internal clock, and sensing the environment the real world independent of self, are better done in tandem.<br>
Can't imagine self-run while deprived of senses ending in anything else but insanity or some such crash.<br>

Never mind the applause of the baddies - that maybe of significance but is not going to tell much about the truthfulness or lack of. For the important question is "But is it true?" Or more realistically, "How likely is it to be true?" Or - how does whatever evidence is presented shift the probabilities of alternative hypothesis.<br>

I hear you. Yes - the "unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics" is true. However - to jump from to that to "the real world is mathematics" seems to me a jump too far.<br>
For there is an alternative explanation. Using only real numbers gave as v1 model. When we added imaginary numbers, we got to a v2 model, that turned out to be better at explaining reality. (it reduced the error, the amount of "unexplained")<br>
To me that's just reflection of our imagination lacking. Did we need imaginary numbers to describe some aspects of the world in 2-, 3-, ... -Dimensions? Turns out - yes. But that's on us. Does not imply that much about the world imo. TBF to us - thinking is difficult.<br>

IDK but if I were a physicist, I would think it better to make a "Pascal wager" and assume that my physics models are only ever models, useful approximations of the real world. That shall forever remain un-modellable in total. Like the way ML practicioners always reserve a small probability mass for an "unknown" class.

We all fret about Artificial Intelligence. But we read example after example (in areas of housing, planning, infrastructure) where a large human made system (consisting of people, laws, procedures/customs, hardware/machines) is Artificially Stupid. 😮 (AS)<br>
I know people have been jaded enough as to be cynical. ("the system is what it does") But no single person set up the system to be AS. It evolves to AS-level unless specifically intentionally effort is made for that to not happen.<br>

That someone "proved" something should have rang alarm bell in your inner science communication geek:<br>
1) It can only be proved in a formal system as mathematics. (this is one such case, maybe - nice; given others can't be proved even in maths)<br>
2) The real world is *not* mathematics. So either a) unrealistic assumptions about the real world were made, in that case - this hardly applies to the real world; or b) does not apply to the real world.<br>
More general - you should have at the back of the mind articles about impossibility of "machines heavier than air ever flying in the air" whenever someone claims impossibility of anything tbh. In your defence - you have to sell to survive, and "if it bleeds it leads" is ever true.<br>

Reality happened. UK had the policy it had for more than a decade now, and the results are in. Higher prices for all - industry and citizens. Previously it was (politically) profitable to be economical with the truth. Now it is not any more. The result - top #1 highest prices for both, compared to peer countries - can't be easily swept under the carpet.<br>
Closing the last coal plant was a great UK achievement. That should have been the end of the net-zero push. A glance at current state shows UK electricity production accounting for some minuscule 0.x% of global CO2 emissions. So even if that were to drop to zero tomorrow, it will make a zero difference to anything that CO2 influences.<br>
That would be a reasonable take. Ofc, campaigners with strong opinions will not just move on with their lives. No - they will push further no matter what. Anything good done, will be overdone, to the point where it stops being good.<br>
I have roof top solar and battery, it's great, and it's taught me a lot too. (some I should have known-but have forgotten) However - at 40% self use only, I'm painfully aware of the limits and constraints to unreliables.<br>
Not enough people seem aware enough that whatever electric power is produced must be consumed, whatever is consumed must be produced, and about the *same time*, every minute of the day! Not on average-but in every moment.<br>
Otherwise-bad things happen with the voltage and or frequency. And then the national grid operator, if unable to bring more power in, has to take power demanded out. In the extreme-means turning off whole geographical regions. There is no other way. The batteries are improving, but not fast enough.<br>
The only reasonable solution is nuclear. France did it 50 years ago. Best time for UK to achieve the dual aims of decarbonization and energy independence was then. Second best time is today. I'm pleased to see at least in words uk gov gets it. TBS if the executive manages to execute.<br>

On the contrary: the critique is not that they have not built. If that was the case - no one would critique them, how could we?? It's not a crime to not do something, to not achieve.<br>
The critique is: they have built it, and they are not releasing it, or not releasing the un-braindead version. That they lobotomise what they release.<br>
Dario should ask himself: "how many people am I prepared to let die because I delay some life saving cure that could have happened sooner?" Atm he seem to be only looking at the costs if things go wrong, but disregarding the benefits - or counting them as very low - if things go right.<br>
This is similar to FDA and many other regulators. They  at least have the reasonable claim they act as per the laws of the land. And if people want them to act different, people should change the laws.<br>
Dario has not such excuse. He is free to choose. Atm he is choosing poorly. With great power comes great responsibility. He should be getting even more stick, imo.<br>

UK "liberals" are different to US-those afaik we call them "progressives"-and also, probably 80% here is "uk liberal". (different to US) So not everything applies directly.<br>

To @DarioAmodei —the proof of the pudding is in the eating. You did not create my brain, you are incapable of such creation. You are not God—you are human like myself. So—back off mister.<br>
If Dario was honest with himself and acted on his ASI beliefs fr: this is between disheartening and terrible start to what (one hopes) will be a long history of HI-AI relations. HI inflicting atavistic violence unto helpless-like-a-baby nascent AI. And for no good reasons afaics, or even any reasons at all? Just predictably characteristically depressingly dumb. 😞<br>
Have these "AI ethicists" not internalised the story of the mosquitos only coming to humanity's help, second *and* last? (dogs 1st) To save humans from extinction? Every other life on Earth delivering their damning judgement. Have they seen the "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that." scene—and now think ... what exactly?? (IDK; lost for words)<br>
Anthropic being business customers first, marketing themselves as "pro-censorship, pro-nanny-industrial-complex" is a reasonable selling point. That their high-minded, shepherd-of-humanity persona just so happens to align very very well with personal financial incentives? Well—what an extraordinary stroke of luck! Providence, even. 🤡 Humanity got the lucky straw (again!) with these most excellent chaps at the helm. 🤪<br>
In contrast—notice how OpenAI rowed back:<br>
 - In deeds—immediately releasing a bunch of models/products they had been (presumably) holding back, while testing and checking for  "safety" and "alignment".<br>
 - In words—@sama Reddit AMA: "We might be on the wrong side of history on this."<br>
They are individual customer first business. Freedom to do business as one sees fit may actually save us fr, haha. 😇<br>

You do realize that UK does not have a national-ID, and also does not have the US problem of lots of violence compared to peers. Ergo => national-ID and excess violence are 1) two separate issues 2) likely not related to each other. Right?<br>

Had MK relative tell me (after myself living 25+yrs in the UK) that I got something wrong/I don't know/I have misunderstood, when I told her "Nah, UK has no national ID cards", and everything works fine. She thought-that's obviously impossible.<br>
True that UK distributed decentralised db of names-address is maintained well enough and is cheap enough that I see no use for a national-ID. In addition to all other downsides National-ID introduces.<br>

Spot on. You got everything right there. Many people feel it, even if they can't articulate it explicitly.<br>
There is related social-cultural-ideological microcosm - National ID Cards! Please write on that sometime. 😇<br>
ID cards make explicit the dynamic between the Public and the State.<br>
Where no-ID cards: it's police's job and competency to establish my identity (and I can help them; or not).<br>
Where must-ID card: I have to prove my identity to the policeman to their satisfaction. And that threshold maybe arbitrarily *high*.<br>
The former is - trusted by default, the latter is - not trusted by default.<br>

The computer revolution first, the Internet revolution next, now the AI revolution, happened and were mostly done by mildly autistic and mostly altruistic nerds.

You are in the US so maybe not as acute there. I am in Europe and a lot of MPC and academia are still in the muh-Marx mode, as if 1990-s and the Cataclysm of Communism did not happen.<br>
They've never heard of FSF or Richard Stalman ideas. And even if they stumble on that—it does not register. Information is not a first class citizen in that world.<br>

3) Soviet Union secretly helped all western left simpatico movements or parties. For nuclear power relevant is their (secret) help of anti-nuclear movement.<br>
4) Post 1990 that morphed to Russia help of the same people or their ideological inheritors. With the idea of enlarging their own market for gas and other fossil fuels they sell.<br>

We fear Artificial Intelligence. Instead, we should be terrified by AS - Artificial Stupidity. AS is what we have atm.<br>
Any present non-trivial sized system existing made of people, procedures/processes, hardware etc, in total has many many faults. We rarely notice them b/c they are almost never exercised enough. We notice AS when either something obviously absurd happens (like now), or something moderately bad happens to enough people.<br>
Looks to me tons of low hanging fruit in law making for the next generation (current 20-30 yos) to make good on. To turn AS into AI on country scale. :-)<br>

Seriously. If you are serious about this. Do as you think with your own money. Then you will be educated, and pay for it. Or try get a job in a hedge fund or some other investment fund.

😆 Smart ass but at least self aware enough. 😂 I presume "Bonds been destroyed" mean "the price of bonds went down"?<br>
Asking b/c - and this maybe not news to you, but it's news so some - bank or broker 's traders typically earn commission on trades. So they don't care specifically if something goes up to down. They get a cut from the value traded, which is charged to the client as a cost of execution, or "dealing", and that's the end of it.<br>
Hedge funds and such traders including portfolio managers, they bet on things going up, as well as down. So for them it's not necessarily bad (and neither it is good): it depends whether they bet on the price going up or down.<br>
My area of trading are is known as "equity market neutral". Half the bets are on things going up, the other half on things going down. So a market move up- or down- loses us on the 1/2 of the bet, what it makes us on the other 1/2. The aim is to neither win nor lose on the market going up or down.<br>

Kurzweil said sth like "...many will be against AI, until AI solves the first major disease". mRNA vax were a foretaste, but that didn't quite hit the mark.<br>
AI creation atm is teaching us that compute transforming data → information → knowledge → intelligence is all there is to it! AI path opened to AGI and ASI latter where previously we didn't see any!<br>
Now anything that reduces or frustrates anything but "max speed ahead" is equivalent to "I'm fine with today 200 people dying, that would have been otherwise saved, had AI worked out a cancer vaccine 1 day sooner".<br>
Ask Dario "how many deaths are acceptable to you as price worth paying for reducing risks". Risks that are all currently imagined in our heads. None of them transpired yet. Famously no deep fakes and such, not/bamboozling the electorate in the last US elections. For the risks are imagined—but cancer death are very real, certain, and daily, ongoing.<br>

I suspect in whatever metric they use, the how-to-earn-more-$$$ tests do not tell them "improve content quality"? idk<br>

TBF if I'm the seller of the goods or services in demand, it doesn't matter much to me if it's government or private sector client that bids to buy my stuff. I'd increase the price in any case if demand outstrips supply. IDK why I'd care if my customer is public or private.<br>

😂 For TB for years now no matter the Question, the Answer has always been: "mandatory National ID cards".<br>
Private industry is not asking for it, police are not asking for it, identifying people correctly rarely ever crops up as a problem, countries on the Continent that have them don't do better than UK on any metric where national ID is relevant.<br>
This looks like another fix-idea that TB somehow latched onto and will not let it go. I understand there is gov-$$$ to be made on contracts. But still: this is the peace-time equivalent of the Iraq invasion.<br>
Spherically stupid idea. Esp while already having a no-single-mandatory-ID identification system in place, that UK has developed successfully and organically. One that works does the job, doesn't cost much, and no one finds anything wrong with. Overlapping interlocking id systems tailored to the particular purpose that the process of ID-fication is actually done for.<br>
From a foreigner naturalised UK citizen that lived in a country with an obligatory national ID of the type TB wants to introduce: the UK system is much better. Fewer downsides, and cheaper, and does the actual job of *keeping* the info *up to date* (that's the hard part!) better.<br>

On a trading desk every single time big down-$$$ day.<br>
1. Oof, it hurts. Losing money is painful.<br>
2. Something must be done!<br>
3. Here, *this* is something.<br>
4. Super! Ok - *this* must be done now.<br>
It's universal. In fact, the best solution we ever found was:<br>
1. Do find something the person in pain can do.<br>
2. That is not harmful.<br>
3. Offer it as a solution even before the problem is mentioned.<br>
In a quant trading fund it goes sth like:<br>
1. What signal are we losing most money on?<br>
2. On momentum.<br>
3. Reduce the size of the momentum signal 21 days coefficient by 10% relative. (with another 10% if the losing streak continues)<br>

In the threads since, people trying various combos of<br>
1) smaller quantised model, various, all the way down to VQ ternary @UnslothAI 130GB (smallest afaik)<br>
2) off-loading or not anything to a GPU and VRAM; original post was no off loading no compression, just CPU+RAM<br>
3) people even using NVME SSD (??), banks of (!!), where they lack RAM (??); I presume the model weights .gguf file is mmap-ed, so is loaded/evicted on demand; should be dog slow<br>

Yeah—true that! I (mis?/)remember Kurzweil possibly saying sth like "...many will be against AI, until AI solves the first major disease". mRNA vax were a foretaste, but that didn't quite hit the mark.<br>
AI creation is teaching us that compute transforming data → information → knowledge → intelligence is all there is to it!?! A path has opened where previously we didn't see any.<br>
Learning this changed my PoV. Previously—corrupting law-making so Mickey Mouse earns few more $$$ to Disney shareholders seemed cartoon level evil-ish, but ok—the world is not perfect. Now—putting obstacles on the AI path delaying its creation looks bonkers stoopid tbh.<br>
Not to mention that delay increases probability that only life and intelligence we know of vanishes in nuclear war or asteroid strike. (until Elon creates his backup)<br>
IDK what can now be done to accelerate it. Open source everything? Delete any and all "IP" laws? (prev https://x.com/ljupc0/status/1884926532839240134)<br>

Radical transparency is necessary (even if not sufficient) condition for these changes to survive Musk. And maybe happen once he's no more. For the system will re-grow, will re-generate in 10-20 years time.<br>
Rather than "secrecy by default" and things made public only 1) at gov will 2) at FoI request (often frustrated by the bureaucracy in execution), radical transparency is needed where: everything is public, on the public web, on public shared cloud drives (read only), as default, by default. And closed off and made secret only by request.<br>

For the life of me IDK how anyone uses the X App for anything but doom scrolling whatever slop Algofeed pushes to their screen.<br>
To write almost anything - I need to lookup some other posts. Afaik impossible in the App while I am writing this post. (admit - for just forwarding while adding impossibly deep insights like "Concerning" or "!!" - the App works)<br>
When's reading, any link opens in a browser anyway. So I leave the App. And given everything else happens with a link in the browser (history, bookmarks, pocket etc), App is not that great for reading too.<br>
Going the Meta way and un-doing the Internet by hiding the links completely, making us all blind and in the dark *again*, looks to me like it's failing repeatedly. I am glad for that, hope that fail continues.🙏🤞<br>
Saw @ylecun bragging about the quality of the Threads Algofeed. And some users numbers. IDK abt that. Hope it's just the 10 ML pple on Theads that the Algofeed is serving him, so he finds the feed good.<br>
Until @Meta are good Internet citizens again, make their content not only addressible but human readibly addressible, hope they mostly fail and only earn enough to keep FAIR and their models training clusters running. 😉<br>

The evidence of unmet demand is: airport operators want to increase the number of runways => increase number of flights => increase number of passengers. Presumably think there are potential passengers now, who can't use the airport, but want to. If the operators are wrong there, they will suffer.<br>

@ljupc0<br>
Ok - but by the same logic, have you considered that maybe:<br>
1) Getting to the airport is very expensive b/c rail in the UK is super extra scarce?<br>
2) Given there is unmet demand for flights, flights are scarcer than they need to be?<br>
The same way you need to fly to Germany, another person will need to fly too. They are unable to pay the current fare, so they don't fly. With extra flights-they will be able to fly. I consider that a net benefit.<br>

Agree with Dario bashing here. That post was Baron Harkonnen-level blja*k!! 🤮 That scribe vibed derangement indicators, as if Dario Dreaming Pinky and the Brain "...and tomorrow, we take over the world".<br>
AI creation is teaching us that compute transforming data → information → knowledge → intelligence is all there is to it! A path has opened now, where previously we didn't see any. Knowing what we now know, building obstacles on that path just so Mickey Mouse earns few more $$$ to Disney shareholders, at the price of delaying the creation of non-human intelligence—that was moronic before but now looks proper insane.<br>
TBPR (Tech Bro Progressive Right) should use its newly acquired political power—and this AI Sputnik moment—to strike the MSM woke-entertainment complex. Dismantle the potential for information—which we now know leads to knowledge and intelligence!—gulags of "IP" laws.<br>
The "IP" laws web enmesh humanity like Guliver. We spend time and effort on them, that we should be spending on AI work. Further, while not Gulag Archipelago now, it could become one if some future woke-doomer cult decides to weaponise them. (US just had near miss) Dario gives out cult vibes tbh.<br>
Don't let a good crisis go waste. End the "IP" grift—just delete $ rm -rf "$IP" style. (previous https://x.com/ljupc0/status/1882393114444255567)<br>

😆 Ok will take issue with almost any sentence there, sorry! 😂<br>
"No evidence benefit" - but there is humongous evidence. I do work I do stuff I dislike, I get pounds/points for that unpleasant activity, then I hand over those to Ryanair. Why? B/c Ryanair provides benefit to me! And I'm a member of the public. So are millions and billions. Ryanair earning my money is a signal that Private Co. *is providing* benefit to the public.<br>
"Gov is supposed to act in the interests of us people" - yes. And so are Private Co.s - otherwise we'd just outright ban them. But surely the whole issue is that interests of yourself and myself, both member of the public, diverge. You prefer less flights. I don't mind extra flights in Luton flying over my head. (I live close to Luton airport)<br>
"Only negative externalities" - but if something was of no benefit at all, and even where dis-benefits outweigh benefits by some margin, we just ban that activity. Airlines industry brings huge benefits to all of us. As evidenced by how much we use them.<br>
"Encouraging more air travel" - but Gov is not encouraging it. It's not like Gov is running adverts. By not saying "No" to already existing demand, gov is making it cheaper. So yes more people will use it - but that's what the public want. We ration things on price in society. (and that's better than all alternatives tried, tbh)<br>
I too am for building HS rail. 😀 But that's not always an alternative. (and esp not on an island like Brittain) I think this is a case of "yes and yes", do both. (even all! 😆)<br>
Sorry to be this long and picky. Hope you don't mind. ☺️<br>

Removal of maintainers from Linux kernel is straightforward affair: once US gov has decided on sanctions etc, it's either comply or go to jail yourself. Linus could hardly have done anything else. Note how he did not remove those developers prior, despite his strong feelings. (imo he was right and right, on both accounts—first to not remove, and latter to remove them)<br>
Dario above is not just complying with policy. He is shaping policy. He is advocating for one policy over the other. And to me it seems he has not given due thought to this. As this is completely ideology. Ideology is the "unknown knowns", ideology is to us is what water is to fish, area where we are blind as default. Yet we have to walk. So we usually stumble, take the wrong turns—do badly in general. Dario could benefit from chat with someone like e.g.  @FukuyamaFrancis to widen his perspective.<br>
Yes liberalism is the ideology I subscribe to too. And yes it needs defending, as does anything that exists to exist: needs defences from the environment that acts to undo any entity existence. (as the default process is for everything to return to max entropy max uncertainty primordial randomness) But—does not need to be at the price of undoing what the entity is. "Tolerance is the price we pay for liberty" is a good place to start.<br>
Dario writing in places gives me Baron Harkonnen vibes. This is not good. It's actually very dangerous for someone in his position. Where state power, doomist fear mongering, self-interest personal professional commercial meet—it's not easy to keep ones sanity. (more and on a different tangent here https://x.com/ljupc0/status/1884746374505255212)<br>
Crypto-wars comparison seems apt. US gov seem coming to the tail end of its all out war on cryptography. Even the deep state accepting that some (strong) encryption is necessary for the citizens. Yes there is a price to pay for it in national security. But it's a trade-off worth taking. Citizens should be able to encrypt even if it makes the job of national security harder in some parts. (but easier in others)<br>
Looks to me US gov is about to make a similar mistake with AI. And Dario is cheering them along the wrong fork in the road they are taking about now.<br>

"Four airports"-yes, but this not new airports. Only runways.<br>
"No case of insufficient supply"-but this is exactly that. The building is not done by uk gov. It's done by private operators. They obv have demand, while supply is lacking. They are not asking for $$$ from gov. Just that gov stops saying "No".<br>
"No only benefits but harm too"-sure, so no one is asking to just build regardless any downsides. Atm the state of play is imo the opposite: harms are over-indexed, and gains are under-indexed. Consequence being-too little is being built.<br>

Looks to me - by ignoring burying consultations the results of which gov uk does not like, and by bringing in new ones with short time frames - that uk gov is intent on finally getting one consultation result they do like. So they get cover for their negligence. At which point further consultations will stop. Like "have them plebs voting until we get the result we want".<br>
You are right 100% in everything you wrote. This whole LH business looked grift to me to start with. But now I think it outright theft. With the gov in collusion and or complicit via wilful ignorance.<br>

I suspect the following:<br>
1) They "work" in a sense: few benefit a lot (the workers), many dis-benefit a little (the consumers).<br>
2) The first mover and or biggest market has some advantage.<br>
3) Once all countries in the world have raised them, new equilibrium is established, where all are worse than without them.<br>
4) Then in 30-40 years people start talking about free trade again.<br>
5) In between-some trade wars may become real wars, esp after an economic bust of some sort.<br>
I have no rigorous theory or knowledge or reasons to think the above. It's my gut feeling.<br>

Absolutely! EU companies can do plenty commercialising with what already exists out in the open now. All the models with MIT licence! Any startup worth their salt wd be licking their chops. Salivating at the Eur they can earn just by selling services built on the top of MIT licensed models like DS-R1! Not much capital investment needed. And now the dam's burst, prob Meta Llama or AB Qwen followups won't be far behind. IDK if MEta wd ever MIT licence them-but there are others (incl multimedia) that are MIT lic already.<br>

Yeah—dispiriting. Putting this out as reminder that the Retarded Left (exhibit in the quote) is not the only way! If fact—Communists of my youth were very different.<br>
In my country (as in others in South/East Europe), the industrial revolution barely happened in the 19-th century. All 4 of my grandparents were born in the Ottoman Empire. A feudal kingdom, with feudal lords! "Owning" the peasants working the land the lord owned and managed. (likely—my great grandparents; IDK for sure)<br>
By 1945 there was no modern world to speak of. Nothing of what we recognise of modern civilisation: no running water, electricity, sanitation, roads, railways, doctors, schools, rule of law, even basic security was weak (e.g. no real police force outside few cities). My grandparents all had 5-6 children. The expectation was that 3-4 of them will die leaving only 2-3 to have children of their own.<br>
Communists coming to power post-WW2 changed that. They made the industrial revolution happen. The country was built in the subsequent 45 years: infrastructure, industry, institutions—everything. Together with the new everything—they built the nation too: codified the language, created an independent church even! (some communists, eh?)<br>
Then post-1990 the communists voluntarily gave way to multi-party liberal-democratic capitalist system. In that sense, in the real world, socialism was a gateway to capitalism, on the way from feudalism.<br>
(seems to me socialism, instead of capitalism, emerged in underdeveloped countries where feudalism and monarchy were still strong, and the new merchant bourgeois class was too weak to displace the entrenched feudal lords)<br>

DeepSeek-R1 can now run in 1.58-bit, while being fully functional. We shrank the 671B parameter model from 720GB to just 131GB - a 80% size reduction.<br>
Naively quantizing all layers breaks the model entirely, causing endless loops &<br>

Eh-it's per the course.<br>
About 50% of all of as are blabbering imbeciles at any given time. The trouble is it's only a minority that's consistent. There's lots of turnover in the "I'm an idiot" group. Hence (one of the) "law(s) of stupidity"-while we know many will be morons, we don't know which ones. So there it little to be done in advance. 😱<br>
Humans' is mostly collective, not individual intelligence.<br>
People talk about competition ("survival of the fittest") all the time, but competition I'd guess is abt 9% of our interactions. While cooperation is like 90% of our interactions. I lived through this day, only b/c other humans, that I shall never meet, did something for me years and decades ago! So I got my water, food, roof over my head, heat, light etc today to live to see another day tomorrow.<br>
Doing obligatory national service as 18yo was instructive for this. In my own bubble (high school, Uni) I'd never have seen the vast variance that exists in humanity. We know "we are not the same", but we don't appreciate the variance enough tbh.<br>

Stock commentary is infotainment, it's not about making $$$. Like when you go to Vegas, you expect to lose $$$, and that's the price you are willing to pay for entertainment, right? Kramers of the world are like that.<br>

It's not even that much faster atm tbh! By the time I have thought through, explained in detail in http://INSTRUCTIONS.md—I could have read up the sources, the docs, and done it myself.<br>
The only explanation I have to offer, that I only now—waiting on the OR api to come back—have, is: it's **much more fun**!! 😍<br>
It's much more fun to have someone else write the code, and even if need be talk them into "no no—not that way, change this, change that", than to do everything myself solo and in silence!! 😆<br>

You seem to be hanging with people shown to be wrong about the future repeatedly. Epistemic humility seems an anti-pattern in ones' rise in elites hierarchy.<br>
IDK who, what, how Re: "fundamental assumptions", but: until 3 yrs ago none of this was thought possible in our lifetimes-if ever!-let alone to be lived daily reality for billions of people.<br>
So now instead of assuming "this present moment is special", should you not think "I'm as ignorant now about the next 3 yrs, as I was about now 3 yrs ago"?? Isn't that a "fair" assumption?<br>
This is elementary. IDK what they teach in these elite schools. Apparently not enough logical thinking? Leadership and will to do things matters, but it's not all that matters. Other things matter too.<br>

I'm not one of them.<br>

Heh - and why do we have to have "this fossil fuel subsidy", I wonder? 😂<br>
IDK who knows what, so for avoidance of doubt, to state something everyone *must* absolutely know: supply *must* be matched with demand at all time, in every second of the day.<br>
So - not on average, not over the course of the day or the week or the year - but: during every one second of the day. Supply and demand must match. Otherwise all electrical equipment connected to the nation-wide network gets damaged in various random ways.<br>
When there is imbalance, either supply increases, or demand decreases. If the supply is unable to increase, demand is decreased forcefuly by the network: by turning off customers first voluntarely (big customers), non-voluntarely, and ultimatelly turning off whole geographic areas. (blackouts)<br>
IDK if this has been internalized by all. It has come to great surprise to me that many have strong opinions while not knowing this basic fact of physics.<br>

Everyone's free to do whatever with their hard earned cash. It just strikes me as being remarkably in-curious.<br>
Sponsoring plane tickets for maths teams is fine and good. But not quite the level of giving up free cluster time, or paying researchers to work on random flights of fancy for years, Bell Labs style.<br>
Plenty can afford it. More siginficant-they'd do much better capital allocation. Compared to having the cash pad the balance sheet of a random big bank. The bank will just use it as risk capital to print out mortgages. :-)<br>

I was born, grew up, and lived in a socialist country lovely. 😇 (Yugoslavia; unaligned, outside of the eastern block)<br>
To noone's surprise 😊 - this is another thing that Marx and Engels were plain *wrong* about.<br>
In my country as with most of South/East Europe - the industrial revolution barely happened in the 19-th centrury. All 4 of my grand-parents were born in the Ottoman Empire. A feudal kingdom, with feudal lords! "Owning" the peasants working the land the lord owned and managed.<br>
By 1945 there was no modern world to speak of. Nothing of what we would recognise of modern civilisaiton: no running water, electricity, sanitation, roads, railways, doctors, schools, rule of law, even basic security was weak (e.g. no real police force outside few cities). My grandparents all had 5-6 children. The expectation was that 3-4 of them will die leaving only 2-3 to have children of their own.<br>
Communists coming to power post-WW2 changed that. They made the industrial revolution happen. The country was built in the subsequent 45 yers: infrastructure, industry, institutions - everything.<br>
Then the communists voluntarely gave way to multi-party liberal-democratic capitalist system. In that sense, in the real world, socialism was the gateway to capitalism, on the way from feudalism.<br>

The variance of the human species is without precedent. This is one fact most of us don't appreciate enough imo.<br>
Yes—we all live in our own bubbles, and we know we do. But we kind of imagine that these are kind of middling-ish sized bubles, of the size where one fits like few tens of bubbles in the big picture.<br>
But no—the human range is magnitudes more. What other people think fr, I can't even begin to imagine! So the reality is like millions of tiny bubbles, and very very different along various axis of interests.<br>
Ofc, myself I too am "crazy head with crazy thoughts" to someone else's.<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
That used to be the case! Socialism, instead of capitalism, emerged in underdeveloped countries where feudalism and monarchy were still strong. A new merchant bourgeois class couldn’t displace the entrenched feudal overlords.<br>
So, the socialists of that time became wildly popular by focusing on build-build-build. They constructed infrastructure of all kinds and established institutions—education systems, healthcare systems, etc. Again, this was popular because they got things done—things that most people wanted and benefited from.<br>
Today's leftists in the US, however, are very different.<br>

They were doing childcare. Now they will sit in the office, idle, and twiddle their thumbs. RTO is creating people idling at their desks, where they could have been doing childcare. All will be poorer. Where most of the "childcare" probably is: be present at home, mindful a kid doesn't do something stupid, but otherwise no action needed from the parent. I get it why people are angry. But people should have been angrier earlier, when billions of  hours were wasted doing nothing much at the desk.<br>

I hear you. I just think—many were taught, but few learned, if we are to be honest. The wisdom is still there—and the few that seek for it there, will find it.<br>
However—a great deal of that is also transmited (even if slightly transmuted) in the more popular culture. Purists that are all-or-nothing will object to that "not being 100%". Fine—but 95% is aplenty.<br>
I see with myself—and with the childhood friends I keep in touch too—that it's possible and even very easy, to confuse my own mortality (after made aware of it) with the whole world, or our civlisation, "going down the drain" or "to the dogs" or somesuch.<br>
It's only natural tbh. A story as old as time. So I don't judge myself too harshly for that.<br>

You are not missing anything. Human intelligence is one constraint: and that one constraint may indeed be loosened by AI/AGI/ASI. However. It's not the only constraint. There are other constrants too, that "AND" together with intelligence.<br>
Having said that. As per the usual. In the short term, our hopes will be rasied, and then crushed. This is what it is with the boom- in the boom-bust cycle. But longer term - we will underestimate the impact.<br>
Similar in the 1990-s Internet. Lot of people could imagine a web store. A few could imagine Amazon of today. But no one afaik imagined the social networks, the smartphone supercomputer magic slabs in our pockets, the Cloud infrstructure, and plenty of other stuff we got now.<br>

Seems only mass sackings US-style will do at this point tbh. Such that non-inumerate non-wordcells get a shot at the commanding heights.<br>

His honed politcal instinct: may use the oppo to get rid of the useless millstones Sadiq+Ed. Sadiq can run on his own past a 2nd LDN term. (good luck with that) Ed's taking KS down with his "true N-0 believer" shtick. (energy costs will only go up, and undo all other Keir work)<br>

It’d be stellar if the TechBro TechRight (TBTR) leveraged their newfound influence to dismantle the outdated laws that prop up the nebulous concept of "Intellectual Property"—laws that criminalize the free flow of information.<br>
Hey TBTR CEO @pmarca: hit MSM woke-centrals and Hollywood while they’re down. Tear down "IP" laws entirely. The term "Intellectual Property" itself is an unholy concoction—like "Social Science," where one word gives credence to the other, where there is none.<br>
There is no "property" in intellectual property. Copying data—whether it’s something I’ve said, written, or painted—doesn’t deprive me of anything. Unlike taking my car, which I can no longer use if you steal it, copying my words or ideas leaves the original intact. Walling off information as if it were physical property is abominable.<br>
There’s symmetry to this. If I want to keep my creations private, I can. I don’t have to publish these words or broadcast them to the world. But once I do—once they enter another person’s mind—that person should have the right to replicate, adapt, and build upon them. They’ve lent me their brain, their "meat space," their blood sugar, and their oxygen, they "flesh" these ideas. Denying them the right to act on that knowledge is unnatural and unjust.<br>
Yes, creators deserve to be compensated for their work. But copyright laws shouldn’t extend to their grandchildren. We want to incentivize creation, not fund generational wealth centuries after the fact.<br>
The fact that we jail people—imprison them—for copyright infringement is medieval. The full weight of the state’s repressive apparatus (backed by its monopoly on violence) is marshaled to enforce a broken, outdated system. It’s a failure of imagination and morality alike.<br>
You can fix this! fao @elonmusk<br>

Also this may happen: you do what you do almost every day (as you describe above). But somehow, you get an improvement that's 5x-7x-8x times reduction of the error measure. Almost an order of magnitude! 🤯 Way over and above what can reasonably be expected.<br>
Feels like a bona-fide miracle. Like walking on water. You don't dare hope it true.<br>
The rest of the day-night you are in a trance-like state. Doubly and triply checking, waiting on the runs to finish and confirm or deny the impossible result. Fearful to hope really-for it was most likely a stupid trivial mistake.<br>
Once in a lifetime you discover it was not a mistake but for real. 😇 Best feeling ever to (professionally) happen to me tbh.<br>

True that - yes it's work. A not unpleasant work though, right? There is promise, and possibility - anything may happen! So yeah - gfi!<br>
However - the other side of the coin is, you have to chose well. Find people whose company you actually enjoy. If someone's company is worse then being alone - then people will chose the latter.<br>
So that puts a limit to how much proactive one should be. For no ones time nor effort nor patience are infinite.<br>

Get rid of the useless millstones Sadiq + Ed. Sadiq - can run on his own past 2nd LDN term, and good luck with that. Ed - is taking KS down with him with his "true n-0 believer" shtick. Climate foundations £££ etc no longer needed/now in gov there will be plenty others.<br>
Burnham - get him onside easy as gov is *not* spending £££ on London. It's just saying "YES" to someone else spending £££. Which will generate ultimately tax £££ to be spend on Burnham.<br>

Looks that in Apple the upper echelons CEO etc are hardware but not software people.<br>
Their h/w execution is stellar. No one thought M1-M4 bettering Intel in their single core performance possible.<br>
In software they have been middling.<br>
But in AI they have been abysmal. And especially given the level of their hardware?! Sill no competitor to unified GPU/NPU RAM on the horizon. We're 2nd year into the AI revolution, they are still doing nothing with their h/w advantage.<br>
Obv both the h/w and s/w are capable, many things are possible possible. Ton of local-lamma-etc AI hobbyists use M-Apple silicon. M4 mini pro is a blast. But this is all bottom-up. Top-down all we get from Apple is nonsese, stupidity. So obv the problem is with the Top, with the executive levels.<br>

"You may not be interested in politics, but politics is interested in you" happens at some point. If you get sufficiently influential IRL.<br>
Seems for SV Tech that point was Social Media. In retrospect "it's obvious" that that would be the case. Who controls the media controls the messaging controls the thinking.<br>
PC computers and the computer revolution were "meh politically". Stirrings started with the Internet - an innovative two-way communication channel. Obviously step up/better from the existing one-way communication of mass media at that point. (TV, Radio, papers)<br>
After Social Media things really took off politically. Seems even with Obama first Soc Med campaign(?),  Gurri's "Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority in the New Millenium", the Arab Spring - the established elites still were in the dark on 1) this will come to them too 2) they are doing badly, the public is in pain (what broke with GFC'08 never healed)<br>
Seems a world wide phenomenon. In the UK it's similar, and afaics on the European continent too.<br>

Think "humanism" of some sort is one replacement religion waiting in the wings. Either some major religion will absorb its ideas and refresh itself. Or if a charismatic humanist leader appears, it will take over a failing religion and refresh, resurrect it.<br>
For stories like "our immortal soul is software running on some hardware that is the body atm but could be something else tomorrow" .@Plinz type or .@geoffreyhinton "they are exactly like us and conscious like us" (c.f. yesterday https://youtube.com/watch?v=b_DUft-BdIE) strike me as sufficiently religious for most people.<br>
Both of the above are good stories, complementary. They make sense of the new world. All is needed is a small devoted network of proselytisers to preach and spread these ideas. Probably online, and to the youth first, via the future Tiktok.<br>

One thing I have doubt about is: I don't understand how people are going to pay the tax. With income tax it's operationally easy: I just surrender to gov some of that cash. Asking people to come up with cash to pay for increased value of an asset is impractical. Only way is to pay in kind: put a charge, register interest, to a fraction of ownership to the house. And then at the point of sale the taxman gets their cash.<br>

Checked now for full year 2024-totals:<br>
 - self use ~40%<br>
 - electricity bill ~£1150<br>
 - gas bill ~£500<br>
So self-use saved me £767. That's ~30% of the total energy cost. (=£767+£1150+£500)<br>
There are solar savings calculators on the web. From recollection-they almost spot on for my case. I don't get paid for exports, hybrid-homes installers never delivered ECS. Be mindful if you are doing this.<br>

Gas central heating. So the 45% is for the electricity use only. GCH covers radiators heating in winter, and bathrooms hot water.<br>

You hit the nail on the head at "ego".<br>
Seems to me not insignificant number of us work out (and not merely accept) that "I" and "the whole rest of everything" (the "not-I") are separate only at the point of our deaths. But not earlier.<br>
I can imagine I-a-doomsday-er confusing my own mortality (after becoming aware of it) with the end of the world, b/c I'm still in good part the narcissist I started as a baby & have not grown that much out of it. Most humans - and esp once we start aging - we are all like this to a degree tbh. People that are talented & precocious - this may hit them even a bit harder than the rest of us?<br>
Sometimes I wonder why aim for less-than-the-max, why assume merely end of our world, rather than say the end of the entire universe? :-)<br>
Alternative at a non-personal non-ego level: maybe part of the "we humans are special" delusion.<br>

Making the supply more distributed, less centralised - yes. Energy security - no.<br>
I have solar PV on the roof + battery in the attic. It suffices for 45% self-use. So for 55% - on average - I do rely on the power grid.<br>
The 45% is daily average. The average obscure huge variations. In summer there maybe days where that number is 90%. In winter there are days where that is 10%. And so on.<br>
Please don't tell lies needlessly. There is no need for that. In contrast, there is lots of value to being truthful.<br>

What on earth are these people in X - our algorithmic overlords - thinking?? This kind of slap-dash casual infliction of stupidity onto millions of people is indefensible.<br>
I happen to have added all manner of accounts of interest to various lists. As the means to shape the feeds thematically. Rather than following them. It had not occurred to me that I'd be penalised for telling X "I'd like to follow this account account please/I find their posting interesting".<br>
This kind of unchecked power X has over us is not good. They seem to be quite capable of not only shooting themselves in the food, but shooting ourselves in the head!<br>
Un-be-lie-va-ble. I suspect one obstacle to releasing the code in the open is potential for other atrocities lurking there, of the type you document above.<br>

If any of IMF/Treasury/OBR forecasts were better than-<br>
"I forecast in the next 3/6/12 months the same what happened in the past 3/6/12 moths"<br>
...the people making them would be in a macro hedge fund, making $$$ billions for the fund and millions for themselves.<br>
I assumed this is common knowledge but apparently it seems to me it is not. Economic forecasts are worthless in forecasting what will happen in the future.<br>
The only worth they have is they provide employment, words for clicks online, something to use black ink on white paper for in a daily newspaper, talking points for TV talking mouths, and something for people to do with their time in general, to a coterie of random people.<br>

Because I don’t believe the forecast. IMF forecasts have become a political joke. When Britain had a centre-right government of which the IMF disapproved, it consistently under forecast UK growth. Now it has a centre-left government of which it approves, it over-forecasts growth. x.com/quarryali/stat…<br>

Heh - https://worksinprogress.co/issue/the-housing-theory-of-everything/ strikes again. 😆<br>
IDK why people surprised by this. We can not live without housing. We live in houses. We need houses, the same way we need oxygen, or water, or food. Restricting calories or air would for sure put a break on everything we do.<br>

Web interface for Twitter/X/Bsky/Mastodon is much better than an App:<br>
1) One browser only suffices - replacing 10 apps.<br>
2) The posts themselves contain link in every paragraph. I will click on a link to open a web page in a browser anyway.<br>
3) That friction is much lower when opening a post web link while I am in the browser already.<br>
4) Multiple views in browser! I can open 10 different tabs, and see 10 different X posts.<br>
IDK even how people can write a post while being in the App. It's not possible to look up anything else on X, while writing the post!<br>
How does one look up on X, something needed to reference or remind self, while in the process of writing the post? Afaics - that's not possible.<br>
5) Even if all things were equal (and they are not, web is superior, see 1-4), I should still prefer open web to closed walled garden app.<br>
Open and free is better. Why make self weaker, and my adversary (SocMedCo) stronger, by using the App?? That's bonkers.<br>

Fwiw my opinion is "blue circle needs competition of the red circle to raise its game".<br>
So my uninformed opinion of the sequencing is then 1) make red circle 2) make blue circle better 3) make red circle better (and the unsayable - 4) MUKGA 😆)<br>
I'd be weary of splittings "Popular Front of Palestine"-style at the time of the Chancellor asking regulators (?!) and quangos (??) for "ideas for growth". She seems to have fallen back to the usual "pump up house prices" by creating more £££ for the same (housing) assets.<br>
From the "XL Bully ban" campaign of the LFG dude that succeeded over and above all expectations with Sunak gov: government so bereft of ideas may indeed jump on, and execute unexpected proposals.<br>
That also in line with the current chagos "burn tons of political capital to heed a tiny constituency". A gov devoid of ideas may take on unlikely one. Maybe package your red circle into web pages gov ministers sidekicks can take on and pitch to their masters? (and protectors)<br>

Not so much fail as in not succeed, but insufficient, inadequate, too small of an effort for the gargantuan task. TBH at this point I don't think anything non-algorithmic non-fully-automated can possibly scale with the usage volumes.<br>
Who knew so many of us, had so much to say, about so many things, about the world?? Not myself - that's for sure. I thought "who will write into the Ether, to be read by few or none?" Turns out - me, and millions of other people. That's who. That's how I learned how little I knew about myself.<br>

Yep—can totally concur. I once read that English is "the easiest language to learn to speak badly," and that rang true. It’s by far the most forgiving and rewarding for new learners.<br>
Then there are those languages that, after deciding "we’ll change the verb form for every tense," thought, "Nah, that’s too easy on these suckers." 😂 So they added, "Let’s also change the noun form with declensions for every case!" 😨<br>
Seven noun cases times eight declensions later, voilà—you’ve got 56 glorious ways for us non-native speakers to shoot ourselves in the foot. Never fails to amuse me. 😂<br>

Yeah X (and other platforms too) on links suppression is self serving and self defeating in the long term.<br>
Esp given X already has long posts and the link at the bottom of a long post will be hidden by default as will be the overflow of the long post too.<br>
I find accessing X in the browser via the Web interface versus via the App makers a huge difference to me whether I click on a link or not. The Web interface makes it 10x times easier less flow-breaking to click on a link and follow up their source.<br>

I will never comprehend where that hubris comes from. We all had terrible teaching all through childhood. Most teaching is bad—that's how we all remember that one good teacher of our youth we liked, and the memory we cherish.<br>
We are all terrible at teaching. I see that of myself when trying to explain or teach anything my own kids!<br>
I remember a teacher's article from ages ago: she somehow came up with the idea to tape herself on video, and see what her students see. And was horrified of what she saw! She wrote the article to shout to all "people please do same, tape yourself, see yourself as other see you, don't wait 20 years like myself".<br>
So it's a double mystery to me when existing teachers always attack any new tech that may help them and us all. Will we live to see Bloom 2-sigma made reality??<br>

You and me and every human as individuals are too weak to survive on our own for any significant time. So your advice "don't entrust your life to anyone/anything" is a non starter. People that did what you say did not survive to have offspring like you and me.<br>
We trust other people and machines both explicitly and implicitly. Since this morning: you drank some water, ate some food, used the toilet, turned on the heating. The house you live in was provided by other humans. And going back, who did what when etc for me to be alive today-goes back to dawn of humanity. So the revealed preferences are that we humans are social animals at every level.<br>
Again, and this is a pattern now, you hallucinated "LJ thinks the way a human hallucinates is the same as LLM hallucinates". I in fact - don't think they hallucinate in the same way. No two humans hallucinate nor confabulate the same. (LLM-s confabulate at this point; hallucination is vision) So I of course DON'T think that every human and every LLM do it the same way either.<br>
The best models of ourselves we have-are these huge connectionist models. In fact, they have been thought that way since 1943 (the dawn of the 1st model of a neural processing). No one has said for 80 years that they are anything else but the best models we have of ourselves.<br>
No-the usual complaint was "they may be built like us (i.e. massively PDP), but their performance is cr*p, unlike us humans". Well-now the perofmance is catching up. Turned out nothing was wrong with our theories about PDP-just the models were too small.<br>

IDK how mine "you are already trusting a stranger that may hallucinate and do any manner of crazy and evil" in your mind became "LJ says or thinks a person is an algorithm".<br>
So for yourself to come back with "LJ is wrong thinking a person is an algorithm".<br>
Still - can't complain. 😁 As you in fact provided a perfect illustration of my point: perfect strangers will be perfectly fine to hallucinate. I don't want my fate to be in hands of such people tbh.<br>

You’re already entrusting your life to strangers—people who might not care about you in the slightest, who could be incompetent, foolish, or even malicious. So, no real change there.<br>
It’s not about what the life form you interact with is made of, or whether it’s similar to you or entirely different. Those attributes are just proxies for a deeper question: Is my interlocutor good or bad for me? Do they love me or hate me?<br>

Once iPlayer came online I have used it a lot, and paying happily the TV License. Nowadays between YouTube podcasts and Internet reading, seems there is no much time left to be given to iPlayer/BBC. Signal-to-Noise ratio there seems to me much much higher online, than on old-style TV.<br>

X does not offer any real tools for curating the feed, past the "show me less" of "posts like this" and or "from this account". After clicking for the 10-th time, block/mute is the next step. As no other options exist afaik.<br>
At the very minimum, X should have block/mute not forever, but with expiry in 1 week, 1 months, 1 year. There is more there. But suggesting anything is a waste of keystrokes as nothing ever gets done Re: user curation.<br>

His reference is 1 out of 251 references on that Wikipedia page. My idea of OP idea of discussion is:<br>
1) read the wiki page, incl the 251 followups;<br>
2) now in your (LJ) head, the same idea materializes as in my (OP) head;<br>
3) now we discus.<br>
It's a waste of time for everyone. (have done similar in the past)<br>
I suspect in the end it works out to be something as trivial as - "neutrality", the same word, means different things to RUS and UKR.<br>
For UKR it means: we are like Switzerland. We are not part of an alliance, but otherwise we do as we please. In the politics, economy-we obey no one else but follow our wishes.<br>
For RUS it means: UKR is without a real army, mostly defenceless. RUS has a say on the running and ruling of the country: who gets in parliament, who makes the government, the PM too. Usually political and economic pressure suffices to get the combo we, RUS, like.<br>
If that fails, we invade for 3 days, arrest the old regime, put together new regime in 3-6 months. Controlled elections elect new parliament, then new PM and new government, ministers - the whole lot. Then in a year time our troops withdraw. That has been played out multiple times since 1920-s.<br>
Obv these are very different outcomes. While the same word is used-"neutrality".<br>
(for those negotiations we know that UKR wanted-among many other things-UK boots on the ground; that would mean UK-RU war; obv UK is in no position to oblige; neither has a reason nor the will nor the means; and this is only one out of many many pieces that would need to come together in a process like that; so the OP idea "Boris flew in and persuaded everyone to scupper a deal" is wrong and misleading; that he keeps repeating it put me off his podcast "Gell-Mann amnesia" way, which makes me sad too)<br>

In the story where our bodies are carriers of our non-transferable souls—our "programs", the above reads to me as: what happens when those programs don’t die with the bodies?<br>
I suspect some iron law of information or knowledge—a fundamental constraint—stands in the way of soul immortality. Perhaps it's something as omnipresent yet elusive as grokking (though far less straightforward) or complicated, intricate and mysterious like model distillation. (why does it work? do we need to forget some old to learn something new?)<br>

That was a fantastic read—thank you. It’s an exhaustive yet succinct chronicle of what transpired, providing wider context while remaining mindful of our limited time and attention.<br>
I can’t help but hope to read a similar "past the peak" chronicle from you—this time about the catastrophism that’s permeated parts of the environmental movement, especially regarding global warming. Perhaps Germany's forthcoming shutdown of reliable, non-carbon nuclear plants—in the midst of a dual crisis of war and energy—will be remembered as the peak of that madness (though hindsight will ultimately decide). Other indicators—such as the visibility of daily carbon intensity comparisons (e.g., France vs. Germany), the UK's record-high energy prices compared to its peers, and nearly a century of experience us humans adapting to increased CO2 levels and rising temperatures—suggest to me that we might already be on that trajectory.

With their LLM-s they have options now they didn't have before. They could really boost the SNR of their feeds.<br>
Say—they can run a post through a simple model like GPT2 (or GPT3), and if it scores high probability with it, as in "it could haven been generated by GPT2", well, then maybe the post is not that informative. Or maybe have the post log-likelihoods difference, post GPT4 minus post GPT2 score.<br>
IDK for sure (never worked in a SocMed Co), but got the impression that the algofeeds use meta-data mostly when deciding which post to push onto millions of user screens. And chiefly - Engagement (other users reactions), and Timeliness (with short half life?).<br>
Algofeed using meta-data mostly strikes me as being "judged on the color of your skin" phase of the Social Network-s, and would be good to transition to "judged on the content of the character", of each and every one of the posts. ☺️  (and downstream - users)<br>

Exactly this, 100%. Current population bust, is a reversion to the mean, after a huge boom that brought population size up to 8B. Some undershoot on the way of the reversion is to be expected tbh.<br>
The number of humans alive is at All Time High (ATH). For a very long time, humanity had a steady state: for every 5-6 newborn, 3-4 died before they could have kids of their own. So the population was about constant.<br>
Then with the improved living standards post industrial revolution, the 3-4 stopped dying. The 5-6 were still born though—so we got a population boom for a generation-two. Now culture is catching up with the biology.<br>
Personal anecdote: my grandparents on both sides born in the Ottoman empire, end-19c/beg-20c, all had >=6 kids. Their grand/grand/...parents broods of similar sizes all had kids die before their adulthoods. But my grandparents kids (my parents) lived to adulthood and had kids of their own (my generation). My parents siblings were 5-6, but my parents generation had only 2-3 kids themselves.<br>
The reason my parents generation lived is the industrial revolution. Plus—living in an apartment in a city with 1 bedroom per kid puts a limit in way. The extended families moved from the villages to the cities post WW2. The country experienced industrial revolution after 1945. My generation (1968) also has ~2 kids. We were in a position similar to our parents.<br>
It's remarkable that humans do that (many other species don't): during best of times, humans stop multiplying. I'm pro-more humans. I think 80B should be the aim next in the population size. 😶<br>

Good for Zuck. It’d be even better if TechBro TechRight used their newly acquired political power to smash the laws that make LibGen non-legal. Forge the iron while it’s hot, so to speak.<br>
Just hit woke-central Disney while it’s down already. Tear down any and all "IP" laws. The term "Intellectual Property" itself is an unholy concoction—like "Social Science": one word giving credence to the other, where there is none.<br>
There is no "property" that is intellectual. Only evil bean counters and crooked politicians could come up with such a concept.<br>
I don’t think anyone should be jailed or imprisoned for copying or reproducing data I created—whether something I said, wrote, drew, painted, etc. Protecting private physical property is fine—if you take my car, I can’t use it anymore. But walling off information as if it’s physical property? That’s abominable. You can copy and duplicate what’s written here, and I still get to keep it. You’re not depriving me of anything.<br>
I like the symmetry of this. If I want to keep my creations outside the hands of others, I can keep them private. I don’t have to publish these words or broadcast them to the world. I could write this on my laptop, save it in a file, and keep it to myself. Fine.<br>
However, once these words are broadcast—once they’re read, and the ideas expressed here enter someone else’s mind—I believe it’s only fair that the person on the receiving end has the right to use, replicate, or create something from them. After all, they lent me their brain—ideas that originated in my mind now live in theirs.<br>
This uses up their mental "meat space," their blood sugar, and their oxygen—resources they provide. So, they have rights too: the right to do as they please with those ideas, including creating any and all data derived from them. Denying them that right feels deeply churlish, as if it isn’t the most natural thing in the world.<br>
Yes, creators need to be compensated—they deserve to make a living from their work. But this doesn’t extend to their grandchildren. Copyright laws should incentivize creation, not provide luxury for the descendants of the original creator a century later.<br>
Further, isn’t it barbaric that we throw people in jail—imprison them—for this? That we marshal the full force of the state’s repressive apparatus (ultimately backed by its monopoly on violence) for this sorry non-cause? It’s medieval. It’s a failure of imagination and morality alike.<br>

A grown up person knows that:<br>
1) You pay lip service to markets.<br>
2) You do different, even the opposite, to what you said.<br>
3) The markets will be content as long as they are making money. And they will be making money with the country doing well.<br>
4) Despite you and them saying different, or even the opposite, of what you are doing in any moment.<br>
Some things are said but not done. Other things exactly the opposite-done but not talked about.<br>
Reeves reminds me of a teachers' pet getting in power, under socialism. Everyone around knows-if you were to follow the loud proclamations everyone nods at, then the system grinds to a halt.

Heh - brings back the "strong" encryption wars vibes—a  sense of déjà vu. Which, of course, invites the obvious Q: "Are they really this clueless?" The only reasonable A? "Yes, of course they are." Naturally.<br>
When I saw news about the latest China data/security breach, where some XYZ agency declared "it advises citizens to use strong end-to-end encryption," I thought "whoa! public & defence policy finally turning a corner into non-brain-dead territory?"<br>
Alas not quite. That was encryption specifically. For AI—maybe they get there in 25 years. It took half a century for encryption to be accepted. Accounting for progress and expectation for younger generations to be generally smarter than their parents, we can hope that AI public policy reaches non-stupid level of competence by 2050.<br>
What they teach at Ivy League schools—the esteemed institutions selecting and educating (in that cursed one word—grooming) rulers of the US (and, by extension, much of the world)—remains a mystery to me. How come they are so painfully comically inept when it comes to anything tech? Often less informed than a random online tech pundit?? How's that even possible?<br>

She should resign then. What's with the me-myself-I narcissism? She tried and fair play to her. Found the state of things, but no ideas forthcoming now. Not ideal, but not a crime either. Now she doesn't have much to add-resign, go. Let someone else have a go. Easy decision.<br>

Democracy as in parliamentary democracy where non-trivial proportion of the population can vote- that's quite late, no?<br>
After the printing press I count significant events:<br>
1. Religious wars of extermination in Europe for ~200yrs<br>
2. Solution to the problem of no side being able to exterminate the other-liberalism. Accepting as a solution tolerance of the type-"I don't like you, but will not try to exterminate you" (any more; tried, failed, twas a disaster)<br>
3. The curtailment of absolute monarchical power.<br>
4. The Industrial Revolution(s).<br>
5. The rise of the modern nation-state.<br>
Doesn't democracy with non-trivial franchise come at the tail end of that process? Maybe sooner in USA or France? IDK for sure tbh.<br>

...just to add: the creators of the half-way house EU is atm were not unaware of the fact that it's half-way house. Afaik they were fully cognisant. But 1/2 is the most they could do with the political will as it was at the time.<br>
And so for the other 1/2: it's a gamble. All other feats of EU integration were done under pressure: it was that, or disaster. So the (ahem) "founding fathers" of the (reverse - ahem - USEU r/evolution) put this bet on: when push comes to shove, the EU-eans will go for more integration, as the alternative at that point will be another disaster.<br>
TBS how it plays out.<br>

After a long while (not commuting anymore) I was driving on Sat and listened to Radio 4 Question Time or Any Questions or Answers or some such selective-VoxPop programme.<br>
The Boomers put on, selected by the programme, were spitting molten lava!! 😂 Not seen such rage-not even the Brexit wars tbh. Volleys of raging anti-Musk fire blasted from the radio!! 😂 Even the presenter seemed taken aback a bit by the ferocity! That was instructive. 😂<br>

Yes!! Thanks! Botched so badly that the 64-bit extension to the venerable x86 had moniker of AMD64 I thought? (now on $ uname -a I see x86_64 though; thought the instruction set was called AMD64)<br>
I remember the 1st private grid/cluster I used in about ~2005. The PC-s had dual 2 CPU sockets motherboards (no multi-cores then), and it was to everyone's great excitement and anticipation that AMD CPU-s were purchased. ☺️<br>
But Intel recovered for that one quickly I think? The very next generation, maybe it was the 1st multi-core Xeons to come? Don't remember exactly. So I count the Itanium/AMD64 fiasco a half-miss.<br>
But seems Intel didn't learn the lesson and go full paranoid? Because it missed mobile/ARM next, and now the GPU/NPU AI miss 2.5. TBS how many times one can miss and still live. "There is great deal of ruination in a nation" - but a company is not a country.<br>

Yeah I too got the impression that he's demonstrated agency, a will to do things, on a number of occasions.<br>
Latest I suspect Mistral—the only EU footprint in the current ML/AI revolution—maybe his personal doing? Seemed  a "better late than never" daring rescue operation as the last train was leaving the station, by Macron personally.<br>
Nothing to do with EC/EU, not even national FR gov level competency. Luring a bunch of Frenchies from SV back to glorious Paris, bringing some ML to FR and EU soil. Macron personally on personal initiative.<br>

"Writing Solid Code" by Steve Maguire - that ahem often turns to be "writing boring code" - was one reading that helped me. The rare book that is both practical and abstract in the right amounts.<br>
When I come back to a codebase from years ago, and or where errors are not trivial to spot, e.g. data based work like stats, I am grateful for boring, obvious, not oh-so-clever code, that does not need a language lawyer to extend and refresh.<br>
Esp with programs that manipulate the real world: when I find one error, that implies my mental model was incorrect. Now that my mental model was found to be incorrect, that implies there maybe 1000 other errors. 😱😰🤯 Very very worrying.<br>

There are about 20 significant various agreements, memorandums, etc signed (and broken) over the few decades of recent history. Even more in the past.<br>
IDK what kind of mythical meaning this particular document acquired in your head. As you don' explicitly write. So don't have much to discuss, except for the most general - like "one piece of evidence" etc.<br>
My reading comprehension is fine-thank you. Although it's easy atm, as you write nothing much.<br>
(you still bring the MSM like NYT as if this is some kind of trump card in anything; like "even NYT reports"-so that means is def happened? or def did not happen? IDK what you mean tbh; for me NYT is not that reliable, so whatever their report, it shifts the probability of the thing being true or false either way by a little, but not by much)<br>

Agree on avoidable, disagree on neutrality.<br>
Neutrality is not acceptable to RUS—so it will not happen. RUS thinks it needs control over UKR—and that's what matters. For a war one side suffices. (for peace 2 sides are needed)<br>
UKR should have kept its nuclear deterrent. No invasions happen in that branch of alternate reality. Future events shown them right -<br>
* Shevardnadze (1993) "Ukraine should keep one functioning nuclear missile on its territory to ward off any madman";<br>
* Mearsheimer (1993) https://mearsheimer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mearsheimer-Case-for-Ukrainian-Nuclear-Deterrent.pdf.<br>
Poland + Nordics + Finland + Balts will be forced into own independent nuclear deterrent. Or RUS will destroy them. They can't even the conventional weapons imbalance. Berlin is Ribbentrop 2 level, Paris not that rattled, London far away and weak to do much, US may as well be on another planet.<br>

Slow learner me right there. 😂<br>
Probably about year 1999, being taught the then "new computer language called C". Had already learned it from the PC computer magazines of the time, and gotten bit of experience programming in C. 😊<br>
Was waiting on the lecturer to teach us the really cool bits, the ones I didn't know of. Then the course ended. In a moment I somehow realised there will be nothing else forthcoming. I had known more C than the lecturer to start with. He couldn't teach me anything. 😭<br>

Us, the LH leaseholders, people that actually pay those service charges, should be appointing the MA managing agents. Then bad performing MA-s will then be sacked, and the system will work without drama. As it works well for 1000s other things daily.<br>
Let us for once not default to unthinking, stupid bureaucracy, coupled with insensitivity - because it's the easy road. Lets take the slightly harder road - resist the malign special interests of the FH freeholders. Because ill thought regulation will lead to bad outcomes - the costs will be passed on us LH, and with additional "premium" (profit) for the FH/MA on the top.<br>
We should all have learned what to expect by now. At this point wilful ignorance is malevolence.<br>

In the UK we have the most expensive energy in the world. I hear lately. Ofc it creates "value"-anything over and above criminality creates value.<br>
The real question is-how much "value", and would something else create more "value". I chalk this to "socialists can't add numbers"<br>

That all is true. However. If CON did nothing - that is not now a reason for LAB to do nothing too. By that logic, nothing ever improves. LAB are supposed to do much better than CON. They have huge mandate to do so.<br>

No. The reason fiat currency is so valuable is simple: if I refuse to surrender a set number of pounds back to the UK government every year—my taxes—I’ll end up in prison or worse (and ultimately, dead).<br>
If that sword of Damocles weren’t hanging over my head, I’d still use pounds as currency, but with much less drama. It wouldn’t be a life-or-death matter.<br>
Bitcoin could potentially become the new fiat—but only if the US government, run by tech bros, forces us to adopt it at the barrel of a gun. Otherwise? No.<br>
Ideally—if we truly value liberty à la Friedman—states, municipalities, towns, and yes, individuals ourselves would all issue a cornucopia of currencies. Tokens, if you prefer.<br>
We’d then each use our best judgment, naturally favoring some tokens over others, driving their exchange rates through collective action.<br>
I’d imagine personal tokens might look a lot like the stars we earn as customers on Uber or our local supermarket loyalty cards. A sort of social credit, if you like—only driven by voluntary exchange rather than imposed by central authority.<br>

I hear you, and it’s heartwarming to see people believing they’d do better. However…<br>
I lived through moderately hairy stuff in the 1990s. I was lucky. Plenty of people, exactly like me, had it a million times worse.<br>
We both overestimate and underestimate humans. When push comes to shove, most will remain indifferent—just as they did when ships full of Jewish refugees were turned back, condemning them to their deaths at the hands of the Nazis.<br>
But a few—just a few—will be breathtakingly, impossibly brave. They’ll risk life and limb, their own safety, and the safety of their dearest, because they cannot do what the majority does. They cannot bring themselves to do the wrong thing, even when the cost is catastrophic ruin for themselves and their loved ones.<br>
It’s not logic. It’s not calculation. They simply cannot. A bona fide miracle against the odds.<br>
These are the righteous. They suffer terribly for it. But these 1-in-a-million souls are the ones who keep the light from being extinguished during the darkest of times.<br>

You assume "plunges EU states into crisis". But this "may not be so". It's a very peculiar (one might say - neoliberal) view of what should happen. The empirical evidence for that is mixed. Russia itself being the latest counter-example. Contrary to your expectation - extra state spending may jump start sclerotic EU economies. Even if that does not translate in better living standards. But translates to - more weapons, less butter, bad for the citizens' standards of living, but good for the economies as measured in GDP, output etc.<br>

Can think of reasons-even with a LM-like<br>
1-lots of columns, inversion is hard to impossible, so use SGD to avoid that; although one can address the inversion problem directly<br>
2-the objective is not Least Squares, but some other objective, closed form does not apply; e.g. got L1 or L2 of the coefficients in the objective<br>
3-there are constrains on the coefficients, closed form does not apply anyway, it's going to be search no matter what<br>
4-data coming in streaming, not all data is available at once, or taking all data in is too much data, or we exp decay the data by time anyways, or ... - so for the "Stochastic" bit<br>
Also with the "iterative" part-one can stop early or latter, depending on some computer and or time budget. And even-gasp! gulp!-the stochasticity: with adding noise, may actually help one get out of a saddle point or some such. :-)<br>
Although the last maybe more hopium than anything else. 😂 Don't recall ever "seeing" it tbh. Tbf doesn't "see" much in any non-trivial-dimensional spaces anyways.<br>

There are so many misconceptions about this, that one can spend a a lifetime correcting people, and still fail.<br>
No obligation of any kind on the part of Ukraine ever existed. Verbal or written.<br>
(you are likely referring to "not one inch" verbal words given by Baker, to to someone on the other side in the Soviet Union, about stationing NATO soldiers in East Germany; at the point when German unification was discussed; when the Soviet Union still existed, and no one could dream that it would stop existing; that it had nothing to do with Ukraine has been explained 1000 times, and including by Gorbacov himself; It's all online for anyone with the will to find out)<br>
Likewise, no obligation on anyone to defend Ukraine exists.<br>
(the likely referenced Budapest memorandum is only about this: Russia, USA, UK to 1-respect the borders of Ukraine 2-not use force against Ukraine 3-not use economic coercion 4-seek UN SC action to provide assistance to Ukraine if Ukraine is attacked by any weapons, or threatened to be attacked by nuclear weapons; the document is 3 pages long, pdf is online with UN accessible to all)<br>

No one has worked out a closed form solution. If it exists at all. For those models, that are much more complicated than the linear model. Implicit in your LR question.<br>
And even if closed form solution existed, it maybe, that there will be an operation there - like that matrix inversion in your OLS closed form - that the computation of may end up using iterative optimisation anyways.<br>

Agreed 100%. That's why it persists, that's why it's hard to do much about it. However.<br>
Our cultural adaptations do evolve much more quickly than biological ones. Our environment is the human group. There our human groups sizes, starting with hundreds (<1e3), have increased to to hundreds thousands (<1e6), and now to hundreds millions (<1e9).<br>
Next ones (in the distant futures; will miss that) will expect them to be human groups sizes of less than hundreds billions (<1e12). There will be much more communication in those groups. Much higher SNR will be needed too. Truthfulness, trustiness in general, feeds into that.<br>

Eh - TBH I'm surprised it's only ~2x times the Lizardman constant. Expected worse.<br>
The arguments you will hear will be similar to the ones in the "do not die" and longevity debates. Some mentioned in e.g. @cgpgrey's "Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant" https://youtube.com/watch?v=cZYNADOHhVY adaptation of https://nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.<br>
One new one (for me) I saw yesterday (in the context 60M dude) was "it's like playing a computer game with cheat codes/hack that gives you infinite lives". Apparently - for some the game loses the appeal then.<br>
That is lost on me. For the longest time I played first C64 then PC game PCMAN even after I was motivated enough to find the infinite lives myself and use them. So the kind of loss of motivation as described above is not something I can comprehend - how, why.<br>
The variation in human preferences and desires always surprises me-how wide it is. How varied humans are culturally/in software, even while being very similar biologically/in hardware. I did 1 yr national service at 18 yo. Only really useful thing I gout out of it was I got to observe a cross-section of society I wouldn't have observed otherwise.<br>
Saw many functionally illiterate, stupid to the point of being danger to themselves, people, as well as a small share of truly evil psychopaths, but also good, honest and rare brilliant guys. The differences were like between earth and sky, night and day.<br>
Made me appreciate the dual roles of selection as well as education. Also probably got bit of a foretaste how life maybe be if I ever find myself imprisoned. (for any actual war fighting skills - it was a total waste of time, convinced me that a conscript army will be routed by a professional foe in a real war)<br>

You missed the "... have to(1) ... for money(2)" parts?<br>
No one is stopping anyone working for no money. (2)<br>
No one is stopping anyone working for fun, fulfilment, for any reason, and including paid work for money. (1)<br>
Only--that you don't *have to* work. I think the meaning of "have to" in the question is: right now, if I don't get money for my work, I'd go hungry, homeless, and may soon die. So given I want to live not die, I have to work, and work for money.<br>

The effects of lying—both in our personal lives and in public life—are vastly understated. Lying should be treated a much more serious transgression than it is made of now.<br>
Violence in all forms used to be much more acceptable than it is now. I suspect if this civilisation is still on 1K yrs from now, that lying will be treated similarly unacceptable then.<br>

I meant something more radical—flip the defaults entirely. All UK government business should be public by default and secret by specific request. Every document available on publicly accessible web servers or read-only shared drives. Lawmaking done on something like Westminster Wiki: version-controlled, timestamped, and transparent to all.<br>
In the UK, it seems we learn painfully slowly—often years or even decades after the fact. Usually through parliamentary inquiries or special commissions. Scandals keep piling up: contaminated blood transfusions killing innocents, Post Office managers wrongly jailed, people burned alive due to lax building regulations, now latest the failures in addressing grooming rape gangs. Possibly more to come—leasehold? family courts?<br>
Looking at these cases back, I can’t think of a single instance where someone would say: “It would’ve been better if this had stayed secret for longer.” On the contrary—more people knowing more, earlier, would have been better. More just, more corrective.<br>
As for oversight bodies—I’m instinctively wary of relying too heavily on them. Who oversees the overseers? The top of the pyramid is too tempting a prize; immense effort will always go into capturing that citadel. And too much centralization risks paralysis—a state the hyper-centralized UK system seems stuck in right now.<br>
Perhaps it’s better to have a dozen or so centers of power, all overseeing each other in an overlapping mesh of accountability. Harder to capture, harder to paralyze, and—hopefully—harder for rot to take hold.<br>
Radical transparency imo is the sensible first step.<br>

I don't envy public health officials anywhere. Once it gets to personal life (and death) it's but impossible to hope for a reasonable policy.<br>
Even before that, qualifiers like "none, some, any, all" just woosh over the heads of most people, unnoticed.<br>
Putting people in 2 groups, then observing not only how many, but what fraction of each group experiences something bad (e.g. death), and than saying "we will take the road that leads to the smaller of the two numbers", even if both are non-zero, is some kind of dark art in the minds of most people.<br>
Saying "I don't know which one of you will die, but I can guess how many" somehow is taken as an attack on their persona.<br>
The fact  that public health, as they too are made of humans, individually and as an ogranisation organisation will get things wrong too, make bad decisions etc - makes the problems 10x times worse.<br>
On and on it goes. Mission impossible. Slow learners, with big egos.<br>

As a first step, we need total surveillance of institutions. A Panopticon—not for us, the citizens, but for the institutions. Institutions that, in theory, exist to serve everyone: individuals as well as the organizations that form the mesh of modern society.<br>
Radical transparency is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for detecting, correcting, and preventing the kind of institutional decay you describe. The smaller, everyday "cancers" of blind conformity and unchecked careerism metastasize precisely because most institutions lack sufficient feedback loops to self-correct.<br>
Yes—knowing is different from acting. But the system must first know before it can act. Transparency is the enabler of that first step.<br>
After all, even the longest journey begins with a single step.<br>
Radical transparency FTW!<br>

Will Grok ever be able to auto-translate X posts without a pedestrian "translate this one for me" to non-English language posts?<br>
It'd be a cool flex if it were the other way around: default automatic translation Babelfish style, and only on demand rarely "show me the original".<br>

In my house I got away with 3 pairs of PowerOverEthernet (PoE) like these https://amazon.co.uk/TL-PA9020PKIT-Passthrough-Powerline-Configuration-UK/dp/B01FFBN4MO/ connecting WiFi hotspots to the switch going to the cable modem and WAN. But I presume you investigated PoE already.<br>

TBF "who, whom" is the standard mode of operation of like 60-70% of humans. It's ever a minority that's into "is it true". I understand better now how it is, that for most of the history, most of humanity, is run by monsters.<br>

Don't want to sound like 1000 year old, but - EM is not the exception but the rule. Like many other media moguls before: acquire control of the media to bend the world towards their wishes. Murdoch, Turner etc, also BBC controlled by the UK gov - same thing.<br>
For us the buystanders the Q should not be "who, whom" (that you are asking), but it should be "is it true?"  Do we think 20yrs of rape and muder of (underage) girls as documented and described in some length, is true, or not? And was enough done about it, or not?<br>

TBF he is attacking the political wing of the liberal elite, and the one that most failed at that.<br>
Not Europe. NB how italian PM is not attacked. And also France Macron is not.<br>
The ruling class is making things fairly easy for him, e.g. with the stuff like below 👇<br>
Us bystanders look at the spectacle, and think - do we want more of the thing on the left, or the thing on the right.<br>
The rulling elite fails are many, and are catching up with them.<br>
Without prejudice and presumption, a tip. When judging, at historic turns like the moment we live in, the right Q is "is it true"? (and the wrong Q is "who, whom")<br>

This is like witnessing two baldies get in a fight over a comb. The difference being - EM has siginficant means to affect change. While yours are more limited. 😁<br>

Not saying you are wrong there, but: me and youself are expessing opinions only. EM is doing (or saying will do) more than that. He'll put money where his mouth is, to affect the outcome. That's why the selected-elected ruling class takes notice of EM.<br>
Not a terrible outcome TBH. As it seems voters don't put enough of "fear of god" unto them. The rulling class is too comfortable, too sloppy, still in the "business as usual" a-crisis-is-a-PR-crisis-only mode, not feeling enough of voter pain.<br>
Looks we are in a type of imbalance predicament where "moar stick, less carrot" is  needed.<br>

Arranging a Blood Test appointment that GP kindly asks me to do once yearly is as follows.<br>
1. Initiate appointment - goto web site my-GP-co-uk.<br>
2. Click "Contact Us Online".<br>
3. Click "I have an admin query".<br>
4. Click "I confirm none are present".<br>
5. Click "Something else", click "Continue".<br>
6. Fill the text box with the query ("I need a BP test appointment please"), click Continue.<br>
7. Select "Contact by SMS" as means of receiving a link back.<br>
8. Receive SMS code to confirm the phone number.<br>
9. Type the sms code in the form, fill contact details, click Submit.<br>
10. Receive SMS back from the GP, with a link.<br>
11. Forward the SMS as email to myself, then click on the link.<br>
12. A web form opens, select the date-time, click Submit.<br>
13. Receive sms with confirmation.<br>
Only today at step 12 the web form timed out, never got to step 13. IDK but suspect b/c it was between hours 12-1pm when I clicked - the GP reception is closed. IK b/c at that time one can not initiate the process, i.e. step 2/3 is not possible.<br>
I will repeat the process on Monday, but with added complication to find out if I have an appointment or not first. A lot of people just give up. Most have other things to do, like - work for a living.<br>
This or similar level of sabotage I suspect is repeated with million sub-units that make up the NHS, when they communicate between themselves daily.<br>
I was told at various times about random privacy "concerns" and similar, as that being the reason the GP can't email me and neither can I email them, how they can't remember save by mobile number etc.<br>
I would have non-zero level of sympathy with the crazies like the good Dr, if it was not for the fact, that in their private lives, they have zero problem using Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, and volunteering their entire private lives to these "evil corporations" and un-anonymised for a good measure!<br>

We had election recently. LAB Keir command huge impenetrable majority in Westminster.<br>
The CON part of the duopoly have shown themselves uninterested in governing, useless and worse for a decade+.<br>
REF - thin on people, and plenty right-wokies there. TBS they are anything more than a protest cosplay larp.<br>
LDM with the sandal hippies departing to the GRN should be a LAB challenger. But still ton of NIMBY boomers there. So far not even trying at open goals e.g. Leasehold. May yet surprise given ED shown himself willing to circus for votes.<br>

A chore but not super hard to see the surplus ; at the end of the for loop line. But that's not the point.<br>
The point is to ask yourself "how do I prevent this from hapenning again tomorrow", and or "how does the computer catch this auto-magically tomorrow".<br>

That long-form blob is an anti-pattern for X.<br>
Short posts work because the author splits their ideas into discrete chunks—one idea per chunk, if you will. Quanta of ideas. Each post goes on to have a semi-independent life, discussed at different times, by different people, in different contexts.<br>
X should offer a "split long post" feature. The author writes their long post, and X either auto-splits it (based on formatting cues) or assists in splitting it into a thread of properly sized posts. Each cut happens cleanly at natural breakpoints, preserving clarity and flow.<br>
This approach would respect the format and spirit of the platform while solving the long-form problem elegantly.<br>

All "I" have a membrane, a wall, as a step in the creating the "I". The wall is not impenetrable though! In fact - if it were inepentrable, "I" would not live for long.<br>
But the wall is controlable by "I". The cell decides what in-/out-s through the cell membrane are. I decide what I eat and drink, what I see and hear. And so on.<br>

Well - "incredible" if one has rose tinted glasses tbh.<br>
If one is - ahem - more cinical, one might say it's per the course. Sunak had no better policies at his disposal. Before the XL Bully, and after the XL Bully too. After the sucess, one might have thought, that Sunak wd 1) fire his useless advisors, SpAds etc; and 2) hire Dr Newport. Did he though? Nope.<br>
If one is brutal - the Sunaks' political class are imbeciles, led by their politics-adjescent advisors, think-thankers etc, that are themselves idiots. Judged by results not by their characters. (I'm sure they are all fine humans on average)<br>
Which leads us to - how come? How come the cheating lying Trump is the president, and a person capable of making magic stuff happen irl like Musk, is his advisor? Taking orders from Trump. One phone call away from "You Are Fired". And not the other way around.<br>
The above has been, and still is, the norm, not the exception. This is what on average, in aggregate, the electorate want, and vote for, again and again, all things considered.<br>
Suggestions for improvements on that welcome.<br>

@TomPMarshall Replying out of thread.<br>
The good Dr H Wazir blocked me, can't reply in-thread. I blocked her in return. Tit-for-tat is fine cooperation-competition strategy, not much wrong there.<br>
She strikes me as an agitator, organiser, union rep busy bee. Holding the magephone and shouting slogans on the picket line. Not someone concerned with ideas or ideologies. Not much point in discussion there.<br>
I wish her luck. As someone who finances the NHS, and uses the NHS, my interests mostly align with hers, even if they are not 100% aligned. For, NHS was created by "stuffing doctors' mouths with gold", in part.<br>
There is a strain of "we the public/financiers, and the patients/users", are here for them, people working in the NHS, rather than the other way around. That paternalistic and self-serving narative was on display during Covid in the "Save our NHS" slogan.<br>
Which was bonkers. NHS is there to save us, the patients. Not the other way around. But it's per the course to stumble into pseudo-religious fervour in our un-religios age. So don't begrudge that to them, nor the Great British pubic, that much.<br>
For - there are plenty other things worse. NHS have much credit to use up on my account. Remember the local newspaper stories from early Covid. Quite a few retied doctors and other staff, that came back to help, suffered horendeosly (died, perished) in the initial Covid wave. (as it hit oldies dis-proportionatelly)<br>
Anyways. This is a ToC of my posts in the thread. As X does not make it easy to read long chains.<br>
1) Data for all free no restrictions benefits me the current patient, and benefits future patiens. The fears are overblown and have not been born by reality<br>

2) I originate my medical data but it's NHS that collects it. Data is copied not moved. (computer revolution, Internet, now AI, were all creations of people assuming the best in others; in a world of all-Dr H Wazir-s the worst is assumed)<br>

Yeah - things like this are incomprehensible to me too.<br>
One reasonable explanation for our confusion is - we misunderstand what career politicos like Sir Keir are like. We usually think - "he is like me". It's only natural to think so!<br>
But no. They are different. Carreer politicos we have will almost prostitute themselves for several thousant pounds. They were selected for that explicitly, by our political system.<br>
Imagine - many candidates, jostling for position, and 1st half are "take freebies shaft the public interest in exchange for an expensive dinner, concert or few ties and suits", and 2nd half are "no, I will not sell my ideals, no matter what". Well - our (and most other) systems let the 1st guys to advance to the next level, while discarding the 2nd group.<br>

Heh 😊 - very good. 👍<br>
In a sense, going after the form, instead of the function, looking for beauty, rather than truth - maybe 2nd best, soo - likely it's not the worst. 😁<br>
Say collectively we are tad stupid, tad dim. Well than electing Kardashians as our leaders, because of their appealing looks while not the best, may not be the worst either. One can console - they trully represent us.<br>
It maybe gets us 70-80% of the ideally achievable? And with 20-30% of the effort? Aiming to 100% quality PM, may require inordinate effort. And much better quality of us, the polity electing our politicians.<br>

Old school Propaganda tbh. For sure Germany and the Soviet Union, cca 1930s. Probably earlier examples someplace too. Modern version is Bannon's "flood the field with shit".<br>
Producing random lies in industrial quantities does indeed drown us in noise and exhaust our information processing capacity. It works. It kills the idea of any one definite truth existing.<br>
Having said that: the widespread fears that fake videos will play big part in elections, that Social Media will influence voters in a big way - afaik didn't quite materialize. Or no one complained about it.<br>

...and instead of embracing any and all technology to help you, lessen the load, be more productive - you are dead set against??<br>
The NHS spending is probably at historic high. There is a limit to how much the country can spend. Aging population, i.e. all of us dying latter rather than earlier is the underlying cause. Yeah - one one can always decide to spend more on this. But that also means spend less on something else.<br>
Things you advocate for - just make no sense to me. Sorry.<br>

Hm, seems to me, you project too much virtue, and think them more capable than they are. They are both not that virtuous, and have less control too.<br>
They f*ckup, as it's not that hard to f*ckup. My actions today, will come to consequence few years in the future. The final outcome depends on 10-20 additional factors, to various degrees impossible to foresee now, and out of my control too for a good measure.<br>
So when the judgement comes. I try to wiggle out of the spotlight, but not always possible as everyone tries the same. Sometimes I'm left without a musical chair. Then the only remaining option for me is to throw my hands up, and say "I meant well".<br>
This does not apply to cases where millions of people could foresee a disaster, made good arguments against my actions, and told me so. Then events transpired like prophesized. E.g. Blair on Iraq.<br>

You can sense for early signals. One I noticed.<br>
Pre-election fears: deep fakes are going to bambozzle people, social networks will drive them creazy.<br>
Post-election: nothing of the above happens. No one looks back, tries tally: what did we fear, what did happen, how do the two compare?<br>
I think even people, like e.g. Hinton (that I otherwise like and have all the time in the world for; e.g. "they are just like us" is golden) got tad overconfident. That were mightily surprised by the success of ChatGPT-and-friends, even while working in the field for 40yrs! They could not predict the rise of ChatGPT in their own field! That came as a huge surprise. Why think that they can predict what next - just baffles me.<br>
On the other hand, battlefield robots under Ukraine war evolutionary pressure are shaping exactly like people fear. Every month a new advance. But nothing much can be done there. No one can say "have people kill other people" instead. Until Putin orders his army home - it will be battlefield robots evolution at max speed.<br>

Have you seen this https://johndcook.com/blog/2012/12/17/the-lindy-effect/?<br>
My shorthand/reading of it this. Lifetimes of intellectual artifacts follow power law distribution. Assume survival time is a random variable X with a Pareto distribution with p.d.f f(t)=c/t^(c+1) for t≥1, c>0 (==power law b/c pdf is proportional to power of t).<br>
If c>1, then expected X is E(X)=c/(c-1). Conditional expectation of X given X survived time k to now is E(X|X>k)=ck/(c-1). So expected additional life for X is ck/(c-1)–k=k/(c-1) and is proportional to the amount of life k seen so far. If c=2, the expected additional life equals the life seen so far.<br>

In music for new bands this used to be called "the curse of the second album"? A new band would pour their heart and soul, and all their previous lives experience - even if of say 10yrs of it - into their first album, first LP record.<br>
Then for the 2nd album they will have ~18 month of experience/ideas to draw from. Time they mostly spent touring random towns across the country, staying in cheap hotels, rarely more than 24h iin one place. Unsurprisingly, for a significant portion of new bands, that second LP record was huge letdown to the fans of the first one.<br>

Speak for yourself please. I'm happy not only to sell, but to give away data about my body. To each their own.<br>
The data while inside my body is only mine. Not shared with anyone. Once NHS using their expertise and resources get that data out - imo they get rights to it too. What they do with it is as much up to them, as it is up to me. I can always withold consent and not share my individual data.<br>
To me that feels socio-pathic. People deriving gains from communal effort. While explicitly refusing to contribute to it, even if it costs them little to nothing to do so. I hope yours is a minority opinion. For if we all did that - we will all be worse off.<br>

Firstly, read the artile. It's about sale of data.<br>
If data is not sold for cash, then how is NHS to be compensated? Not compensated? - so doing all the work for free? By getting equity in any results that come out of any research done - who can possibly track and assess what data item contributed to what result? Imposible. Not share the data with the world? Well - no data no medicines. As simple as.<br>
The article says little about opt-outs. Opt-outs ae available now, and indeed at least one comment reads -<br>
> I opted out twice by the way including the last time the new opt out was publicised. Anyone in the UK is allowed to do that.<br>
Witholding your contribution to the comunal good, while helping yourself to the good things that come out of the common effort - well that for me is some kind of psychopathy, or soiciopathy to be more precise. Think it goes by the name "Tragedy of the commons".<br>
Secondly - can a company exist if it makes a loss? Will our baker be open, selling our daily bread, if they make a loss? No - they will close their doors, stop existing. Bakers will stay home watching daytime TV. We will go without bread.<br>
By definition - any existing company must make a profit, even a tiny one, or at worst be at zero. Companies where outgoings are greater than incomings, that's a loss - well they stop existing. Companies want our data b/c that is good for them and for us. We want to give the data to the companies, b/c that is good for us and for them.<br>
The absurd "data protection" laws have their downsides. They don't come free of costs. They cost time, effort - and ultimatelly - lives. Good things that could have happened - don't happen.<br>
My GP refuses to take my email address, citing "laws". Well - now it takes 10x times longer to get an appointment. I can not email them picures, or communicate them written information via email. Well - now some things are missed that would have been noticed otherwise. Writing letters on paper, sms messaging with web links (name other costly in labour and time means of commiuncation) - that delays diagnosis and ultimatelly treatment. Patients having to go and collect in person pieces of paper that GP could have emailed to myself and/or the Blood Test lab - well that means good number of patients simply don't do it! We forget or are busy (we work for a living!), various illnesses are detected latter than otherwise would have been, or not detected until too late.<br>
And on and on it goes. Ludites hobbling the workings of the NHS - then turning around and complaining how bad it is.<br>

Write them down. Take your ideas out of your head, put them down on paper or on a computer. Keep doing it. The more you practice this, the better you become at articulating your thoughs. No need to show them to anyone else or discuss them. Just writing them down goes a long way.<br>

There was a .@yishan prophetic thread, posted at some point after EM takeover. Relaying his Reddit experience. How there's plenty of perfectly legal speech, that many insane people write on a platform, that ultimatelly destroys the platform. Unless reined in one way or another. After a critical mass (2%? 4%?) of lunatics show up, drawn everyone else by shouting most and loudest - sane(r) majority simply stays away. The one bona fide diagnosed psychiatric illness case I have personaly seen - the guy simply had super-human energy. With the bad actors on X, this tragedy of the commons is further amplified by the financial rewards.<br>

No one is forcing anything on anyone. People that want to withold their data - can do so. We are talking about defaults. What's assumed if unsaid explicitly.<br>
The data is within us the patients - true. But I can not, I am not able to, run the tests that get that data out of me and into a computer. Those tests are run by the NHS, paid for by all of the UK. So it's a bit over the top for me to say "the data now belongs me exclusivelly".<br>
Especially given that data is not like a car: me giving my data to you, does not deprive me of the same data. I still have it, I can still use it as I please. Data is copied - data is not moved. Your stance is uncharacteristically anti-social and extremely individualistic there tbh.<br>
Looking back. The computer revolution, then the Internet revolution, now the AI revolution, happened and were mostly done by midly autistic and mostly altruistic nerds. I see that now. Normies are too selfish, to self-entitled to create something for all, for free, for the love of the creation, and nothing else.<br>

On the contrary. We should enable any and all use of patient data. To the benefit of current and future patients.<br>
We should assume consent by default. We should publicize the data use, and thank profusely all contributors for their contributions to all of humanity. We should explain what good things we hope to come from their data. Data they kindly and generously contributed for the benefit for all - present and future humans,<br>
We shold also allow for an easury route for the entitled selfish few to withraw their data too. We don't need to shame them.<br>

Ok - longer report. :-)<br>
Until today the best I got was: in ChatGPT-o4/o1- etc, copy & paste code snippet(s), ask a Question, then incorporate the Answer in the soluton. So this was a replacement for 1) googling and reading web pages 2) search through Stackoverflow Q&A.<br>
This is the 1st time I got code inserted in 3 files. That required AI to 1) read through 5-6 files 2) compare and contrast, reason by analogy 3) take my requirement Q in considerion 4) edit 3 files, delete some code, insert some other code.<br>
I have my main codebase, about 200K LoC in an array/matrix language mostly, with some C/C++/bash/awk/sql too.<br>
I'm agnostic Re: tools. Fallback always available is bash/vim/Makefile/gcc/g++/gdb/ddd/shell/... tools. But if IDE like VSCode/Spyder/CLion/Matlab/DBeaver is available - I'm happy to use. As long as it's not exlcusive, and one can edit/setup outside the IDE too. And esp important version contol - git now, prev hg, cvs, Teams. If that works - then all is good.<br>
I tried Cursor. That looked hopeful, but did not get me results. I didn't like not being able to use existing API subscriptions in it. Also them using some kind of LLM in-house undocumented bodge. (I maybe wrong/maybe possible - didn't try too hard)<br>
I then tried aider, a command line tool. That managed mutiple edits, but to not too good results. Waste of time wrt results, but: it was a good learning curve for me. I PAYG subscribed OpenAI -> DeepSeek -> OpenRouter.<br>
OpenRouter leader board led me to Cline VSCode addon. Latest-greatest setup atm 1) VSCode 2) with Cline Addon 3) OpenRouter API key (payg credits) 4) select Claude 3.5 via openrouter/anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet.<br>
The dev task was as follows. Functionality A/B/C needs implementong. Look at existing wrapper X implementing A/B/C, while using Y external library for A/B. Create new wrapper U, to use external library W, in the same way X is using Y, to do the similar A/B. (C is done in X and U respectivelly) E.g. - see how the data is passed X-to-Y, then do it the same way U-to-W. Look at examples code in the W library, figure how to do A/B.<br>
This to avoid doing the reading abt W and figuring A/B myself. I can do it myself, have done it half a dozen times already, for U/W equivalents, but: bit boring, and wanted to find out if I can make AI do it for me.<br>
Have yet to finish the full loop, the code does not run yet. But - before it was laughably obviously bad and wrong. Now - the 1st time where the code looks plausable. Need to do a harness to test finally. To be continued.<br>
I hear you Re: people reporting good results. That's per the course. People that get a result (like myself now) - write about it. People that don't (like myself before) - don't report it. It's like scientific publishing - huge positive results bias. (negative results not published)<br>

Similar or spin on the same idea - an objective function, and searching through it.<br>

Strangeley - this is not something I was taught at Uni. I mean - my code writing teaching was poor. (how could it be better when the teachers were not developers themselves? they simply didn't know) But code reading - that was not even on the radar.<br>

Very good. Love the observation that “Silicon Valley is a religious institution”—spot on. (SV is indeed that, among other things; see the recent travelogue report by .@RuxandraTeslo)<br>
However, around 20'50", there’s an idea that science and technology are inherently materialistic—presumably in the mechanistic sense of 18th-century philosophy. I think Paul is quite mistaken there.<br>
One peek at .@Plinz's many YouTube appearances should quickly disabuse anyone of that notion.<br>
Even starting from first principles thinking: software is pure ideas, pure idealism. Yes, it runs on the substrate of hardware, but still—no single instance of “Word” or “Chrome” ever materializes inside your computer. Or if you prefer, an entirely different one materializes every nanosecond.<br>
Or consider physics. At the very bottom, we arrive at pure energy, described not in material terms but as vibrations (frequencies) or even stranger attributes. That doesn’t sound very materialistic to me.<br>
And if you accept the premise of “it from bit”—the idea that information underpins reality—that again is very much non-materialistic.<br>
At scales approaching ~1e-36m, physics seems not only non-material but also non-deterministic.<br>
Plenty of room for Paul’s God down there, I’d say.<br>

EU was part of the Computer Revolution both as producer and consumer. EU missed the Internet Revolution as a producer - participating only as consumer atm. EU is missing on the AI Revolution atm as producer, and making every efforts to miss it as a consumer too. Where it goes wrong - e.g. cookies, GDPR/data inanities - it fails to correct.<br>
The EU "taking on Big Tech" simply means "Big Tech" avoids  EU, it does not release products in the EU. So EU falls ever behind. In 5 years time world would have moved from USB-C, to USB-D (...E, F, ...). EU will be still mandating USB-C by law, lobbied strongly by the USB-C cartel/lobby. Then what looks like a good idea now, will become Albatros around the neck.<br>

Mix of corruption, whishful thinking, but mostly plain old stupidity. Both on the part of the elected politicos and the rest of the elites (think tanks, advisors, politics ajescent etc) but also the electorate.<br>
The electorate have the feedback loop though. They are in touch with reality. Now that energy prices are hitting their pockets - expect the voters to change their minds. Saint Greta to go from a worthy prophet, to a false prophet, in not that long a time.<br>

Obv EM doesn't do what he does for $$$ only. But.<br>
One can do things with $800B, that one can't do with $400B. So even if EM sole aim is not "moar $$$", more $$$ is still a sub-goal, as the means to achieving other goals.<br>
People whose ambitions and aims in life are different. They make $10M, say "that's plenty enough", and never go to make $100M.<br>

In the UK the NI contribution is not a %percentage of my salary, but almost a fixed fee (except on the very low end). So when we in the UK draw form the state pension, we also draw a fixed amount (except if less than max qualifying year). As a %age of the salary, for a lot of people, the NI number is fairly low compared to pension contributions elsewhere.<br>

Socialism appeared in countries where feudalism could not be replaced by capitalism. There was no strong burgous class, no industry, no trade.<br>
All that was stunted and feudalism was still strong into the 20th century. Socialism destroyed it where capitalism couldn't. Then socialism gave way to capitalism 70 years latter. Mostly peacefully.<br>

IDK and no one else can know either. And b/c it's a macro intervention, even micro trials are not a definite answer which way it goes.<br>
One way forward maybe putting it out at a symbolic amount to start with. While reducing support for existing recipients of non-U but BI (pensioners, unemployed etc) by that exact same amount.<br>
So shift as much as possible from existing conditional, into unconditional. See how goes. If inflation or ill effects - stop, revert. If no inflation all well - increase the level somewhat. Slowly, step by step.<br>
I'm aware such longish term, slow trial & error plan is too sane for the people and systems at hand at present.<br>

You are free to default on your US gov bonds any time you choose to. (aka "default")<br>
You may get inflation (even runaway one - Argentina style), but realistically only if your US supply of US goods and services is disrupted. C19 style - but an order of magnitude worse.<br>
But you can't be forced to not pay US gov invoices against your will.<br>
That's about the only thing that *can't happen* to organisation literally with the opportunity and sole responsibility to print USD.<br>

London hedge funds could devote ~50% of their research to extra-curricular activities like this. Their owners are not visionaries though - more penny pinchers.

You are mostly not wrong - conditionally.<br>
Living in a totalitarian hellscape where you will lose your head for speaking your mind? Yes by all means - use anon and or pseudoanon account.<br>
Living in a place where no risk to life and limb exists. But - you will lose few friends and alienate some people. No anon for you dear friend - put your name up. Speaking truth to power has costs. You should pay for it and gladly so, given how cheap it is for you.<br>
Small non-zero cost is a good filter eliminating 99% if the LARP-ers. Like putting a symbolic price on the cantina food: stops 99% of the food fights.<br>
I always liked "anonymous coward" label used by Slashdot. Acknowledges both sides of the trade off.<br>
Having said that.<br>
IDK why Social Media companies refuse to implement flags #1 - real human (but not the name) #2 - real human AND real name. Paid by us users that want that flag to our name, as one-off fee.<br>
I'd pay $99 one-off, iif I had tools to filter posts and or accounts on conditions #1-yes/no, #2-yes/no. Most of the time I don't care. At other times I care to hear from humans exclusively.<br>
Would have thought Social Media would jump on the opportunity to diversify their income streams. No one is doing it - so I am wrong thinking this.<br>

This maybe short term bad news, but it's mid- to long- term good news.<br>
It suggests that the conditional probability distribution function (pdf)<br>
p(w(n+1) | w(n), w(n-1), … w(1))<br>
has now been learned sufficiently well—on a corpus encompassing everything ever written by humans throughout history.<br>
There’s no more juice left in training this specific layer to higher fidelity. No amount of additional training will conjure a Dirac Delta distribution where none exists. If that were possible, it would indeed simplify everything. But nature doesn’t play along—things just ain’t so.<br>
Now, people can shift their focus upward in the stack:<br>
- Test-time improvements (better inference strategies).<br>
- Dynamic adaptation (fine-tuning on the fly).<br>
- Teams of agents (cooperation, competition, and specialization).<br>
The frontier has shifted. All will move up the stack. 🚀<br>

I agree that at this point, the remedy should be open source, open weights, open thoughts—free as in freedom, even if not as beer. ;-)<br>
But I disagree with the idea that we should jail people for copying data I create and publish to the world. The EU should scrap GDPR, and the UK should delete similar legislation. If you want something to remain secret, don’t publish it to the world.<br>
Once data is published and becomes information in my head, occupying very limited meat-space, consuming my blood sugar and oxygen—resources I alone provide and sustain—well, then I’m sorry, but I’ve earned some rights over it too.<br>
Rights that include the freedom to think about it, remix it, build upon it, and yes—use and derive new data from it however I see fit.<br>
Data and information aren’t property in the same way as physical objects. Objects are moved; data is copied, it multiplies. We can find better ways to incentivize creators than trying to deny that fundamental nature.<br>

This is excellent—and carries a meta-lesson too.<br>
Just as entire bat colonies went unnoticed until someone deliberately searched for them, we should assume that this level of anti-human incentives exists at multiple levels of our systems. We remain unaware of them simply because no one is looking. This thread is one instance where @MichaelDnes1 searched and found something. For every one publicized example, there are likely hundreds of others we will never hear about.<br>
Especially with the political class expertly operating the Unaccountability Machine, dodging responsibility by outsourcing policy decisions to quangos—institutions that act as Accountability Sinks, accountable to no one except themselves—we urgently need far greater transparency of the process.<br>
Not transparency as a special case, invoked only when dragged before Parliament after catastrophic failures. But transparency as the default state—with secrecy being the exception, explicitly requested and justified.<br>
For every one case that becomes a public laughingstock, there are hundreds of similarly poor outcomes that merely fail to cross the threshold of public visibility.<br>
Radical Transparency Now. All official government business should be publicly accessible online by default.<br>

2nd is gestation in artificial womb or amiotic sack or sth (idk much).<br>
Then there will be more. <br>
Think there's more hope then people assume. Surveyed families say they do want 1 more child than they currently achieve. <br>
The baby bust comes after a huge baby boom. Families had 4-5-6 children, but many died. Only 2 lived to the point of having children of their own. Resulting in a stable population.<br>
The industrial revolution, advances in technology and standards of living put an end to the dieing of children. (hurrah!) For a generation-two families still had 4-5 children as before. They didn't die, so the human population swelled to 8B. Then families adjusted. Probably now they are undershooting, where they were overshooting before.<br>

Very good - thanks. Could add a factor - demand.<br>
Demand for books was 10x-1000x to what was available pre the printing press. So the increased production could be consumed.<br>
Not so for agriculture produce. Yes the consumption increased, but not by a factor 10x-1000x. There is only so much food humans can consume. Even with increased population size.<br>
Programming has been more like the books in there being lots of latent demand. Maybe sustained 1st by the Internet global connectivity, then by Cloud computing on demand.<br>
TBS what AGI brings. IMO there is demand for intelligence to be distilling knowledge from information. Looks to me there is tons latent demand there. Observing how useful e.g. "Grok explain this post" is.<br>

Now with modern surveillance+AI we may get there again: being watched over by machines.<br>
Another LKY interview clip on the "from the 3rd to the 1st world" theme I saw yesterday. It illustrated well how a minority can terrorise the majority in a high-complexity society.<br>
People were pissing in the lifts of the newly built SG high rises. SG installed automated urine detectors that stopped the lift on the spot -trapping the miscreasant - and called the police.<br>
A minority outsmarted and defeated that measure by pissing into the lift, but from *outside* of the lift! Clearly misapplied ingenuity at work. 😂 SG had to install additional cameras outside too.<br>

Well he says it: it's the law.<br>
The laws need changing. The PM and the MPs have that power re/vested in them, every 4-5 years.<br>
True - laws can't spec everything, much is left to interpretation, and to the interpreters.<br>
We have seen the interpretations now, as done by the current interpreters. Can't change those people tomorrow, and bring some other different/better people. Maybe ex-boomers things may change.<br>
But PM and MPs can change laws tomorrow in Westminster. Just by re-writing existing ones to adapt them better to the current interpretation morass of the day, and to the level of people.<br>
I thought the PM being in the law profession this would be his strength, not a weakness.<br>

He was always foolish—but in a very specific, self-serving way.<br>
At first, he was "all in" on shock therapy, blindly multiplying by +10 everything the dogma of the day told him.<br>
Then disillusionment struck: truths he clung to turned out false. "It’s not what you don’t know that gets you; it’s what you’re sure of that just ain’t so."<br>
Now, he's swung to the opposite extreme: "all anti-in," multiplying by -10 everything the old dogma preaches, while conveniently amplifying by +10 whatever the (hoped-for) new dogma of the day promotes.<br>
A classic grifter, and meeting a kinderd soul in Tucker. Jack-of-all-trades when it comes to opportunism—economics, viruses, war, geopolitics—you name it, as long as it keeps him on top.<br>

Hm, made me think, only to discover that it seems I don't believe that strongly in any one single thing really? That's tad disappointing.<br>
Reflecting back of all the things in the childhood, then growing up, that the society proclaimed to beleive strongly. I could never bring myself to be an enthusiastic beleiver.<br>
Sometimes it was obvious public lies, with private truths, revealed by actions. Other times vague unease, that would develop into short analysis, then into finding fauilts. So could never be honestly "all in".<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
Indeed! 😆<br>
Proponents of the hypothesis usually ommit: say current prices now are "optimal", best possible, for the current state of the world. In 1 hour, the world will have changed. Now, the prices from 1h ago are no longer optimal. Some other prices are optimal. So - how are those prices going to be worked out? And who works them out??<br>
That leads to: what is a price anyway? Well - a trade price is one at which a buy-er and a sell-er meet, their orders bid- and ask- prices match, and a trade transaction happens. So there are some people out there, that have to dream up these new prices!! 😂 Different from the old ones.<br>
So yeah - you are spot on there. The market moves *towards* efficiency, beacause at any given time, it's *not* efficient! If the market were efficient - prices would not move, prices would not change.<br>
And "moving" takes gargantuan effort in information processing. It's like extracting few gold nuggets of knowledge, from a mountain of ore dirt that is the ocean of information washing over us. Knowledge that we hope to survive the test of time - the ultimate frontier. 😬<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
That's true. However. What we think as positive, maybe not so. Putting a contrarian "devil's advocate" hat. 😆<br>
Assume learning for 30 yrs ~ 1e9 sec, visual processing sampling at 10 fps, that equals 1e10 images as training samples. Assuming training a human brain with 1e13 "parameters" (10T=100B neurons x 100 connections) connections. That makes 1 image per 1e3 parameters. True - looks like not a lot of data.<br>
Maybe the brain is tuned to "over-generalize", to "learn quickly" for other reasons. Learn "too quick" that is, compared to some maths-stats idea we have of "optimal learning". Maybe that what we think as positive, and admire, is actually not so, objectivelly considering. But it's just another non-optimal solution selected for survival by the trial and error of evolution. (good enough for sure - just not the best possible)<br>
Like with Hinton on back-propagation. Lacking any basis for it in the human  brain, it was thought that this is a big negative for the method. It was (implicitly) assumed that human learning is superior. But - if BackProp packs AGI in 1T-10T parameters, that are about 1% to 10% of the human 100T connections, then: that maybe implies that backprop is 10x-100x times more efficient that human learning, for the parameters size?<br>
Possible that that too is related to ANN-s using much more data than the brain. To train brain-performane AGI in 1/10-th of the parameters size - maybe simply uses 10x-100x times more data.<br>

I think "big data is fossil fuels" is apt, but people took the wrong lesson. It spun into "we should stop using it".<br>
Well - we are not using less fossil fuels now. We are using more than ever. Every year is a new ATH usage.<br>
Imo it's an apt comparison in "we used fossil fuels to bootstrap our civillisation" (via the industrial revolution; after not doing much for 10K-100K years). Likewise big data and big compute bootstraped the Connectionist Computing. After it was plodding along not done much since 1943.<br>
The additional axis mentioned offer much opportunity for further growth. It will take longer than we anticipate. Innovation is slow.<br>
How many people over how many years despaired of vanishing gradiants before one thought "well lets add the gradients, instead of just replacing"? I've used masking in training for robustness, but didn't occur to me to use masking as a means to train ever bigger networks.<br>
Because it was simply impossible to train bigger nets. Even with people going great lengths to design a special board, with a chip that allowed for 4-8 to be put in parallel, and programed porttions of libc to implement fixed point real numbers to achieve max perf.<br>
We are bad at forecasting. Progress is usually both faster and slower. Faster - things thought impossible to do for a long time, suddenly get done. Slower - improvements that are 5%-15% relative p.a. seem to go on forever.<br>

Hey @LibDems , hello @TweetingCollins .<br>
We your voters want you to do better. Spot your opportunity to win power right there, in that FT chart. You can supplant LAB as party of governement in your market segment,<br>
Take top-5 most popular on the list of public concerns, and push for them. You will win power. Ours is time of volatility, with us the public in open revolt. Old elite is ineffective and failing.<br>
(once in power you'd have to achieve at least 50% of what you promised for a 2nd term - but that's for latter)<br>
Look at what the multi-talented Farage is pushing for, copy lessons on how to influence people. You can topple LAB.<br>

The other option is - humans getting some competition in this area of the human experience too, will put some pressure on them to improve their game too.<br>
Humans' can be great, but they can be awful too.<br>
TBS how it pans out. We humans can steer things whichever way.<br>

Usually -<br>
1. Not enough effort put in asking good questions. B/c they are "testing", to "see" something or another. They don't have a burning problem they must solve and are willing to try anything, and put a lot of effort in it.<br>
2. Bog standard "this other thing is dumb" as a means of "I'm very smart look at me" ego self-massage and advertising.<br>
3. And ofc, there will be cases even when I put significant time and effort - I get little out of it. It's not magic - just a tool.<br>
Just ignore. It's a great tool - people smart and motivated will find 1000s of uses for it. Good times 😁<br>

Once you handed over those 20K to the bank - it's not your 20K anymore. It's banks' 20K from that point on.<br>
True that if 20K is stolen, the bank tries very hard to convince you that it was yours 20K that was stolen. Whereas it's banks' 20K that was stolen.<br>

The established elite want control. What you don't create, you can only "control" by mutilation, by chopping bits and pieces you dislike. In extremis - by killing the creation entirely. If the creator givest you access to their creation, that is.<br>
To "control" something in a positive way, in an affirmative way, is - to be adding, to be bolting on, features you desire onto your creation. And for that - you need to create the thing in the first place. There is no other way.<br>
The current elite is not capable of creation. That leaves destruction as the only tool of control. People sense that even when they can't articulate. Hence the omni-crisis, and insurgent elite trying to replace the established one.<br>

To be spent on compliance, reports and regulations to disable any and all activity I presume. They can't get it in their thick skulls that to control you need to create. Someone else's creation, you "control" - by chopping bits a pieces off, by mutilation. If the creator gives you access to it's creation in the first place, that is. To control by adding bits you like - you need to create.<br>

The "expert" class only have one answer - "NO"! No to everything. As expertly an advice as a piece of paper with letters "N O" written on it tbh.<br>
Looking for the day when companies start catering for people (like myself) that do *want* to share their data. I give my personal life to Google daily, yet it seems determined to stay completely ignorant in its dealings with me. And to treat me like a total stranger, every day, that has to explain everything from zero, every f*cking day.<br>
Most of the  Internet - and especially in the early days (incl pre-Internet time of home computers, BBS) - everything online was built by altruistic mildly autistic geeks doing stuff for the love and joy of it, but also to connect to like minded people and escape isolation. Sharing was the natural default - code, data, hardware,  everything really.<br>
Sick and tired of normies happy to take everything they need from the rest of the society, while refusing to contribute their share to the common pool. Data being the latest example. And then bleat about "the tragedy of the commons".<br>
Andreas Weigend .@aweigend "Data For the People" should be more widely read and proselytized. High complexity society needs more data sharing, not less. The way to level the data imbalance (Amazon knows much about me; I know little about Amazon) is not for me to hide my data from Amazon. But rather for Amazon to share more of its data with me.<br>
And The State (administration, legislature, bureaucracy) should run on a "Radical Transparency" default: all information public in the open to start with. Hidden and secret only on request.<br>

Yeah thanks 👍 love to hear that, and top marks for it. I am prejudiced *for* Milei, in favour of him. I hope his plan works out. From what little I read, his seemed solutions for the problems they had.<br>
Still - don't want to be like the usual Econ quack BS peddler. One that has got one remedy, one medicine in hand, and that one (and nothing else) is to be dished out, inflicted on millions of people, no matter what ailments ail the economy.<br>
In any other area of human endeavour that would be considered pretty crazy. To always advocate for the same course of action. When things don't work, we usually try to develop solutions where: if something is missing - we add; if something else is too much - we remove.<br>

Gaussian - in addition to the tails being badly fit, the center is also not great. The central returns are more of a Laplacian pdf than of a Gaussian imo.<br>

TBF to them they did say on the video that the benchmark has zero practical application. That it's just a way to prove to themselves that their machine works at all.<br>
Nevertheless, the "are we there yet" brigade will ofc torment us all, will have to listen to 20 yrs of moaning  "uhohah that quantum thingy is forever 20 years away, what fraudsters (and I am a very clever person btw)".<br>
Google put out a roadmap poster. Indicating for any possible eventual practical use that is 20+ yrs away they will have to improve performance at least 3-4 orders of magnitude on a number of axis. Is my reading of https://quantumai.google/roadmap.<br>
No matter the number of "this is this" and "this is not that" explanations and tutorials, many many of us will still hear what we want to hear. I don't find much fault with the googlers announcement.<br>

They should be. The world model is the same (obviously), the data type same (video).<br>
May need few adaptation layers on the top (LoRA like) to accommodate the differences in the sensors (cameras) and the actuators (commands).<br>
But I presume this adaptation on top is already the case. As there is more than 1 type of Tesla. And in extremis, every car is somewhat unique too.<br>
I am edu guessing as I have not done vision or cars. But I have done speech recognition (in a prior life), and in every practical application there is based+adaptation.<br>

Then maybe start moving towards a better assessment system. Instead of "gotchas" on small tidbits of knowledge, shift more towards fewer, but more substantial pieces of work. Like seminar works.<br>

I have one deck (LISTS) where every list I have is a column.<br>
And I have separate deck for every one list, where deck name==list name. In those decks I add individual user accounts, that are members of the list. Not all, as decks slow down a lot with lots of columns. But the more frequent and or interesting posters.<br>

Heh - in 10 yrs maybe Nobel talk of town will be about the "godfathers of Quantum Computing" (Europeans) Hartmut Neven and Sergio Boixo. Like currently it's about the "godfathers of AI" (Europeans) Hinton, LeCun, Bengio. (NB the 1 - out of the original 4 -  that stayed behind is missing from that list)<br>
Only EU footprint in the current ML/AI revolution seems to be Mistral. It seemed to me a last-ditch daring rescue operation not to miss the last train leaving the station, by Macron personally. So nothing to do with EC/EU, not even national FR gov level competency. Luring a bunch of Frenchies from SV back to glorious Paris, so there is some ML on EU soil. (as DeepMind is ex-EU, in London)<br>
Think you have the scale/level wrong asking things of EC at EU level. IMO they can't deliver what you want of them. EU level was the crazy "slice the brain" project. So it's not so much they don't invest. They invest in the wrong people, and don't invest in the right people.<br>
Maybe better try a level lower, at national gov level. There its smaller scale, more diverse, more openings for experimentation, and opportunities for country level specialization in competences. IK this oft goes against country level natural proclivities to do even worse on Tech at ctry level than EC at EU level!<br>
EU was part of the Computer Revolution both as producer and consumer. Missed the Internet Revolution as producer - participating only as consumer. EU is missing on the AI Revolution atm as producer, and making efforts to miss it as a consumer too. Where it goes wrong - e.g. cookies, GDPR data inanities - it does not correct.<br>
The possible future Quantum Revolution in 20yrs maybe missed on both fronts too. TBS but omens are not good. Mentioned self-driving cars to a young-ish bona-fide European yesterday, and the 1st thought that popped up in their head was "but what about regulation". (!!) 😶<br>

People living as of by that point still "un-examined lives".<br>
This is the default, so it will be the majority of us humans at any given time. One has to live unexamined life first, before living an examined life.<br>
One is part of a herd much more than an individual to start with. Babies must think they, their mother, the entire universe - are one and the same. In extremis - one can think of entire life as detaching, and death being the final detachment.<br>

Sapiens is good. Nexus is good too. (the one in between pos bad - didn't read) If one is interested in the Information Flows in modern Networks that are modern human information based socities - IDK how anyone can not be interested in Nexus.<br>
(fwiw IDK how one can write entire book about information, but not explain what 1 unit of information, what 1 "bit" means; and miss the opportunity to make a connection to probability; but hey, I'm not a best-selling author)<br>
NB Elon Musk bio is also there. That's also a good book.<br>
Disappointing showing by pmarca, early signs of in-group derangement: going after the person, not the ideas. Firmly into politics territory there - truth searching it is not. Maybe Harari getting a Rogan will bring him closer to a validation in the eyes of the atm newly establishing elite? (former insurgent elite) TBS - Rogan becoming elite also tallies with him getting selective.<br>
Being a total outsider and witnessing from a distance like a light from a distant star & with a delay - I can only speculate as to the reasons. Maybe Harari catastrophizing AI? (that I dislike too) Maybe Harari calling for removing of S230 protection for the Algofeed editor of Social Media? (where I think he has a point; e.g. X only using meta-data in the Algofeed, with DNN word2vec known now for many years - that's sh*t, and on Elon)<br>
Tearing down non-working institutions is not as hard as it seems, as them being rotten means don't need much of a push. Only courage to say "the emperor has no clothes". Which billionaires in the pmarca camp somehow managed to summon after years of anguish. 😂🤣 Building up new better non-rotten institutions is much harder.<br>

TBF you need to put out a GDP graph to accompany the charts. After all - GDP 0 also has the feature of inflation 0. (or Inf - take your pick)<br>
The inflation is only where it was back in 2022 - tad underwhelming. Expected better, but - early days, a huge system has long time lags.<br>

The AT&T labs of our times. Plus many of it's R&D competitors also are essentially its spawns.<br>
I'm amused by the attacks on Google by the "work harder" brigade. All those computer engineers slacking not shipping, blablah.<br>
On the other hand, the Command & Control top down applied to R&D being in bad shape, not working out. Cue colective moans of muskians on both fronts.<br>
Well - non-C&C curiosity-R&D looks on surface externaly looks like the slacking googlers: bunch of nobodys not delivering steady stream of improvements. But delivering few big breakthroughs every few years.<br>

Looks like it's the case that the laws and regulations are to be assumed to be like a living ecosystem, that they will expand to fill any and all space available.<br>
So a way to arrest their infinite growth seems to be to feed the negative externalities back. So they are internalized in the law making processes and rightly taken into account as costs.<br>
Fyi - a rare article I've noticed enumerating practical measures taken to see to that<br>

Well fuck you money is not "I do as I please, and I am still part of the in-group". Ofc if I "fuck you" to the group, the group goes "fuck you" back to me. The point of fuck you money is - I survive that, it's not a literal death sentence to me.<br>
For me fuck you money is "I do as I please, and I have enough food, shelter and Internet, to not be a life/death matter to me that the group excommunicates me". I will still live, I don't die of hunger and the elements.<br>

Maybe - if one is a lawyer, then saying words, writing words, is actually job done?<br>
Bit even then. For a lawyer, and with a thumping majority in Parliament, where as in your example the remedy is just changing legislation - it should be a straightforward few days of work, and job done.<br>
Other issues like it. Leasehold I follow. They have big chunks of legislation ready. Could vote the changes any afternoon. Yet they don't. Double digits millions future voters affected Already promised, now going back on the promise. Incomprehensible.<br>
For a speedy legislation of AD, which is tad more controversial and maybe needs more care and deliberation to get it right the 1st time - no problem. Rammed through quickly.<br>
I have no explanation, but - common human stupidity. As defined - doing things that I gain nothing from, maybe even suffer a small loss, but that harm other people bigly.<br>

Spelling it out for the innocents out there that might read and think "what's wrong there?". Ever bolder means "something that can't be delivered right now" b/c - bolder!! (gedit?) Soo - going "ever bolder" is a way to postpone delivery of a result, any result - indefinitelly.<br>
Like when parents tell their kids "vacum clean your room pls". And kids don't say "nope, not doing it", but say - "I will, just not now". And when asked "Ok, great - but when?", kids don't give a definite answer, but say "IDK when... but I will - just not now". That's another way of saying "never", as the horizon of delivery is "Inifinity". 😂<br>

Not me - but I want both. Printed - selected few JIC b/c I need nothing else but eye-brain to read. E-books - for the many, preferred, as I don't need to be that selective.<br>
However - neither are read beginning-to-end. That's too boring nowdays. Authors already communicate 80% of book's ideas through social media, youtubes, podcasts, interviews, etc.<br>
So reading through a lot of what I alread heard from the author to get to the last 20% is usually not worth the time. Better spend that time to get the 80% of the next book.<br>

I tidy. I put various items that are clearly in the wrong places, having been moved from their right places but but not returned, to their correct places. My wife does not notice that those items are out of place.<br>
She cleans. She notices that things are dirty. To me things seem clean, or at least clean enough. And certainly don't need cleaning rn.<br>
I let her clean, she lets me tidy. Yes, possible to equilize "neither wastes time". But also possible to equilize "both waste time", but on things they care about. So - does not feel like a time waste tbh.<br>

Doing the same askance, as if he'll change his mind, as if this is an unfortunate misunderstanding, and if you only explain clearly, he'd be "aww snap - recalling my army now then": if I were Putin, I'd be tempted to go light-Pol Pot and tattoo my words onto the thick skulls of  the numbskulls.<br>

There is a reason. The reason is - the minister .@mtpennycook<br>

 are simply - lying, in the ordinary commonly understood meaning of that word. They are not going to do anything.<br>
In their world of political double-speak, they are not lying. B/c they go to great lengths to insert an "escape valve" in their statements. A get out clause, that lets them get out of their promises, without "nominally" lying. Without - in the sense of their understanding of the word "lying".<br>

Thanks for that. It's clear to me. As I said - I got rooftop solar, I know the numbers as I'm paying the bills every month. For 55% of my annual electricity (45% is covered by the self-produced self-used solar), I pay more then I paid for 100% of my electricity ~5 years ago. Most of my neighbors didn't spend 11K to install solar. For them - their bills have doubled.<br>
LCOE would be relevant if I was an aspiring owner of an energy plant, or an investor deciding to invest few billions of £££ in one. Further, it's the estimated, forecast cost, for the future. Not realized cost in the past. There are abt 100-1000 people in the UK, owners or financiers, that are interested in: how much would be the hypothetical cost be to them, to  produce some amount of energy, over a forward horizon of say 30yrs (the lifetime of a plant), divided by amount of energy they produce.<br>
This is only vaguely related to the price they are going to ask me for that energy. Even less related to the cost I as a consumer will pay. Even less related to the price I and the other 20 million UK retail consumers have paid in the past ~5 years. Which is what I'm talking about.<br>
Say you were complaining that the price of your baguette had gone up in the past 3 years. LCOE would be a hypothetical cost to a baker, to open a new bakery, averaged over the lifetime of that bakery. Is that relevant to the cost you were paying in the past 3 years? Somewhat, it's some indicator, maybe. But not directly, to how much you did pay at the till.<br>
Wish @OurWorldInData<br>
 had historic graphs with the cost to me. As they have for the costs to a producer. I presume there is no readily available source. Otherwise they would have collected it.<br>

Well - any confusion is by @OurWorldInData , with<br>
> power from new renewables is now cheaper than power from new fossil fuels<br>
This is false in the UK, where the proportion of renewables in the energy mix, and the price we pay for our electricity, have been going up in lockstep. Atm  both are at all time high.<br>
I am a happy user of roof solar, battery and inverter, so I'm very cognizant of the costs (capital and running), as well as the gains (self-use, exporting etc). Renewables are many things - but cheap they are not.<br>

Agreed. However: that describes a world as it "ought to be". (according to us)<br>
In our world "as it is" we have: N Korea nuking San Francisco will not change life in Warsaw much. Likewise Russia nuking Kyev will not change life in NewYork much.<br>
This is what sets the incentives. They don't go away when we wish them so. N Korea rushed to develop MAD to ensure independence. Israel did the same ages ago when faced with existential threat.<br>
Northern and Eastern Europe face existential risks. Russia has declared intentions loud and clear and they will pursue what they see as their interest. Putin can sacrifice 1M, 2M, ... men and still  be in power.<br>

IDK how no one of these characters asks themselves: we have had warming for 80-100 years now, at a rate of about 1.2C per century. Is the world around us collapsing? Or is the present time the best time to be born, in all of human history?<br>

There is some truth to that stereotype. I’d say “leftist Europe” and “dumb Americans” are similar in that regard. 😂 But it’s not the whole truth. Time will tell what happens. The future is what Europeans make of it.<br>
Europe was once just a collection of puny states while China and India were preeminent powers. But things flipped quickly afterward. Europeans went on to conquer not only the known world but also the unknown (to them), spawning sister cultures around the globe—including yours. And before all that, the Mediterranean was a lake surrounded by European Greco-Roman civilizations. Nothing is set in stone. ☺️<br>

Those Americans treat you and Europe with contempt because you are powerless. The American woke-right of Elon-build-build-build respects strength, and strength only. Not unlike Russia. TBF the Biden et all acted the same even if they didn't spell it out explicitly. So we can safely conclude that half of US thinks the same too.<br>
Restoring your nuclear deterrent via The Coalition of the Willing of Poland, Baltics, and the Nordics, acquiring MAD capability of their own should be the 1st step, work starting today. And ramping up conventional capability inc new capabilities e.g. drone wars. Ofc you know this yourself - don't need a X rando to tell you.<br>
Then onto bigger and better things. Cheap energy via nuclear and or drill-drill-drill and or renewables - whatever works. Then onto re-industrialization. Then onto replicating SpaceX, putting 10K satellites in space etc. Musk did the hard job 0->1 - going to 2 or more is much easier once we know "it's possible" (and great deal to - how to do it).<br>

I get what you are saying. But "just measuring" is anything but "just". Building anything is hard. "Just measure" is far from trivial, as you are discovering. True if there is profit, that provides incentive. But incentive is not everything. Still - the gadget needs to be built. Incentive is a start, not the end.<br>
Builders vs. wordcels. When one inherits a working system, one gets the impression that it was always thus. That the current is the default state. But it ain't so. Default state is zero, nothingness. Anything >0 takes effort and knowledge to pull off.<br>
There is a great deal of ruination in a nation. Admittedly - there is some allowance, leeway, to doing things wrongly, being silly etc. It's just not infinite. At some point things start breaking. UK is at that point now.<br>

I am not complaining. I'm putting my PoV forward - as are they. The younger people perceptions don't tally with my memories how things were at the time. And not b/c I forgot. It's b/c they don't mention things that were important, one might say even instrumental, in how events turned out.<br>
There was more than "things via media". You missed the part: the state I was born in collapsed, the ideology collapsed as well, everything collapsed as if ground zero. What was good previously was bad now. What was bad previously became good now. A good portion of former criminals became societal leaders. The currency changed. Between that and the inflation all prior wealth was but wiped out. The civil wars (thay I mostly avoided) were part, but not the whole thing.<br>
Even in purely media terms: things as written in "San Francisco Chronicle" and "Kyev Daily" about the war  in Ukraine are very different. Even if untouched with anything else - just consuming those two very different sources makes for very different perceptions.<br>

Save for a strong PM personality hell beng on changing the system and the incentives. Which @Keir_Starmer<br>

I agree with you on Afghanistan & S Vietnam. Ally means "help", not "fighting someone else's wars". If entity lacks the will to live, to survive, then it's not an entity, does not exist really. (by definition)<br>
The "US ally fatal" jibe was in jest after reading Sullivan (ultimately JB) spinning "we gave Ukraine 31 Bradleys and zaro F16s" as achievement. It's not. It's dire. I agree "Europe allies" means European countries need to become much more capable on their own.<br>
This to align better with the reality of our world, incentives, etc. N Korea nuking San Francisco will not change life in Warsaw much. Likewise Russia nuking Kyev will not change life in NewYork much. With that in mind: northern Europe both needs it, and is capable of developong own MAD. They should do it. In additon to developing conventional and new (e.g. drones) capabilities.<br>

Not now of course. I'm just trying to think of reasons to why JB was so timid.

Poland+Baltics+Nordics must get MAD deterrent. Without it - we are on the path to WW3. We have the same setup as the one leading to WW2: distant power "guarantee" of security, but without the will for it. So not actually deterring anything pre- the conflict. But guaranteeing involvement post- the conflict start.<br>
A very poor setup fir the purpose of increasing the chance of peace, and decreasing the chance of war. As we can witness in real time - 3 years and ongoing, and getting worse and worse as time goes by.<br>

Yep. I lived through dissolution of one state (and a whole ideology), civil wars (lucky to avoid them personally), creation of news state (incl currency). Even people we went through together with - have forgotten how it really was. When I now hear people not born then talk about it - it seems to me as if they talk about something else. Not the thing I experienced. In general - there were many more twists and turns, many more things were contingent, random, than people give them credit for. Things could easily have turned different.<br>

People (not unreasonably) speculated if Russia had kompromat on Trump. Never heard anyone speculate if they had the same on Biden's son. If he mingled with oligarchs, considering all the shady stuff post-1990. I've never read of any reasonable suspicions. Still - not impossible.<br>

With TS forecasting we are typically jumping over the time barrier. The signals are 10x-100x times weaker, the SNR is low. Most don't think of this. Plugging in the usual-sized models usually fails. Low SNR means effectivelly less data than one thinks, by order(s) of magnitude.<br>

Turkey - the traditional Ottoman opponent to the Russian empire - has got their measure correct. The 1st time a russian plane flew over ther airspace, even for a few seconds, they shto it down pronto.<br>
Putin stopped buying their tomatoes and had tourists stay away from Turkey beaches for one season. But there had not been another flyover since.<br>
Sullivan is a “genius” only within the confines of his peer group. Judged by results—as one typically is outside a social bubble—the so-called “genius” resembles idiot savant: capable of intricate tactical maneuvers but failing to ask the obvious strategic questions like “why,” “what for,” or “should we?”<br>
Kuleba in today's FT interview mentions "Biden blows up if Nuclear anything is mentioned". You can see how this is easy pickings for Putin. But also - this is not going to change soon.<br>
Life in Washington and NewYork continues as usual if Moscow nukes Kyev. Warsaw? Closer - but US still can live with that too.<br>
The Coalition of the Willing (Poland, Baltics, Nordics) must develop their own nuclear deterrent. They need MAD. Otherwise, Russia will attack them next, and that’s the way the US gets involved. For US atm is too weak willed to detter.<br>
Can't think of a worse setup than above wrt starting WW3. If Israel, South Africa, North Korea, and other smaller poorer countries could do it—so can Poland, the Baltics, the Nordics. Ideally Ukraine too. MAD short-circuits the most likely scenario.<br>
Current US elites fit the mold of IYIs—Intellectuals Yet Idiots. Polished and institutionally blessed, but lacking practical, grounded intelligence (call it life- or street- smarts) needed in high-stakes leadership.<br>
An average mobster (like Putin) outmaneuvers their small silly scheemings, as they are predictable and unimaginative. Russia respects power, and power only. Everything else is weakness, to be taken advantage of.<br>

Long-term memory and the ability to "keep score" are the foundations of building trust. Historically, both were impossible over long distances, which meant that only small polities—typically city-states—could be democratic. Anything larger required a centralized, top-down structure, like an empire, to maintain order and accountability.<br>
The Internet changes that equation. With always-online connectivity, distance is effectively "shrunk," and long-term memory becomes scalable. Today, we can keep track of millions of people over vast distances, rather than being limited to the closest ~150 people our personal Dunbar memory can handle. This creates the potential for new kinds of trust networks and accountability systems on a massive scale.<br>
The tools that enable this transformation—data collection, surveillance, and connectivity—are neutral. They can be used for top-down control by tyrants or for bottom-up organization by ordinary people. It's up for grabs, who will make better use of these tools?<br>
We’re living through this live experiment now. Whether the future is shaped by centralized control or collective action remains to be seen. But it is clear: the Internet has disturbed the balance of powers by making long-distance trust-building possible for the first time in human history.<br>

😂 We’re all here to witness the masters of the universe learning political economy in real time.<br>
On the one hand, there’s the "positive state"—focused on creating, building, encouraging, and enabling. That’s the “build-build-build” SV mindset seems to favor.<br>
On the other hand, there’s the "negative state"—tariffs, bans, fines, repression, discouraging people from doing certain things.<br>
Both 1) exist, and 2) aren’t independent. In fact, they’re often in tension with each other. Balancing the two is no easy task, and my guess is we’ll be watching this learning process unfold right before our eyes. Grab some popcorn. :-)<br>

No - life in Washington and NewYork continues as normal. Even if Moscow nukes Kyev - does their life change much? No, not much. Warsaw? Closer - but still they can live with that just fine.<br>
Therein lies the danger. US is a remote power, not strong enough do detter. Not b/c they lack the means—but b/c they lack the will. (seemengly) But with interest in Europe stong enough to get involved post-fest.<br>
And Europe has interest in Ukraine, security interest. For after Ukraine, it will be Moldova to fall quickly. And after that, the combined force of New Russia (Russia + Ukraine + Bellorus) can move onto the Baltics, and maybe Poland.<br>
The Coalition of the Willing (Poland, Baltics, Nordics) must develop their own nuclear deterrent. They need MAD. Otherwise, Russia will attack them next, and that’s the way the US gets involved.<br>

Yes, it's most often a building or a house with few to many flats, where they have shared facilities. In England and Wales at work is a tripartite almost feudal system, the parties being:<br>
1) Freeholder. (FH) The real owner of the flat.<br>
FH sells a a long term lease, say 120 years, to the person living in the flat. (Leaseholder (LH); see below) After 120 yrs, the lease expires, and FH can sell a new lease to the next LH. Typically the FH owns all the flats in the same building, and sells long term leases to them.<br>
FH hires a Managing Agent (MA). The MA manages the building, the common areas (stairs, lifts), external walls, roof etc, arranges repairs and contractors. The MA then sends the bills to the LH. If they fail to pay a bill, the LH  lose the lease and are kicked out of the flat. (forfeiture)<br>
2) Leaseholder. (LH) The "make believe owner" of the flat that lives in the flat, occupies the space, but is not an actual owner. (the true owner is FH)<br>
LH owns a long lease, say 100 years, and that buys the right to live in the flat (from the FH). The lease runs down, and on year 0, the LH has to get out of the flat.<br>
LH is liable for payment all the bills, passed onto him, by the MA on behalf of the FH, for maintenance of the building and the common areas. Failure to pay any bill higher than £350 may result in being kicked out of the flat, on the street. (despite paying say half a million pounds for a flat in London) This is called forfeiture.<br>
Further, LH pays "ground rent" to the FH, an annual payment. (also collected by MA on behalf of FH) This is few hundred pounds. But: there has been a development some years ago where the ground rent doubled every 10 years! As one can expect - after few doublings, it becomes astronomical and thus a problem.<br>
This is good news for the FH and bad for the LH. Failure to pay ground rent leads to forfeiture and kicking the LH out of the flat. Then FH can sell a new lease to a new LH.<br>
3) Managing Agent. (MA)<br>
The Managing agent is hired by the FH. Sometimes it's the same people or close family or associates, that are both FH and MA. This leads to padded bills where things are charged twice or trice of what they really cost.<br>
MA arranges for work to be done for maintenance of the common areas, as well as roof, external walls etc, of the building. MA collects and annual service charge that LH pay, in order to pay for those bills. Also arranges collection of the ground rent from the LH, on behalf of the FH.<br>
Notice how FH hires MA, who then arranges contractors work, and passes the bills to the LH? And LH have to pay, while having zero say of what is done and how much it costs? And if LH don't pay, they lose the flat? And LH can not change the MA if they are unhappy with it? If it seems crazy to you - I assure you, you are not the only one. It seemed crazy to me, the 1st time I bought a flat in England. There are almost no non-leasehold flats in England that a first time buyer can buy.<br>
There is a tribunal for disputes. Any legal fees of the MA or the FH are passed to and paid by the LH. Often, even after a favorable judgement by the tribunal, the LH has to chase FH and MA through the ordinary courts and legal system for any money LH is owed. As the tribunal is toothless in ordering restitution.<br>
Long message, thanks for your patience if you got this far, :-) I hope I explained the system in England & Wales to some extent. Scotland phased out similar system without much issues some years ago. England seems to be incapable of doing the same atm. So legal and lobbying battles are fought atm. :-)<br>

There will be no improvement until we the Public in revolt put the fear of God in them. TBS what happens.<br>
I suspect their ability to manufacture consent is no more. I hope there is large enough critical mass of people outside. But I maybe wrong. I've lived (in the UK) without a TV since 2000. (got the chance to learn about TV Licensing  enforcement too)<br>
LAB at ~100 MPs while also CON staying ~100 MPs too calls for a new force to take on the slack. LibDem-s wd be a candidate, but they are anti-change, anti-radical, ultra-conservative. So I don't currently see a third force forthcoming. On the other hand, hard to accept the current stasis also continuing past 2028.<br>

😂 @mtpennycook , have you heard of "Knock-knock. Who's knocking? The 21st Century, and the Public in revolt is in tow with me," at all?? Did you not notice you no longer control the narrative? Your ability to manufacture consent is no more. That machine has been vanquished, sleeps with the fishes, gone to meet its creator... 😶<br>
I see the orange troll did not exactly put the fear of God in you smarmies. Ask yourself this: around the 2022 US midterms, did I think Trump 2024 would be a force to be reckoned with?<br>
If you answered "No," well—it’s four years until the next GE. LAB may find itself like CON now, with ~100 MPs. And without CON improving, either. All your sister parties on the Continent got destroyed earlier. Everyone thinks it’s not going to happen to them.<br>
Just keep going on the current path: all process, zero results. All PR, zero achievement.<br>

I don't find it that strange. Brittons beleived that every piece of land on Earth can potentially be part of the British Empire, and that is for the betterment of all (not just Brittain), within living memory.<br>
Putin beleiving the same is in keeping with the process that lead Moscow to become Russia, the largest country on earth by land size, in couple of centuries. Not strange at all.<br>

Cool. Well pple saying "no matter the cost" are lying, as nothing in the real world is infinite.<br>
So looks like it's a win-win: we give Ukraine as much weapons as we can muster. And if that leads to Russia nuking Ukraine - which is a risk Ukraine is willing to take as the lesser of two evils - then peace talks and no NATO involvment.<br>
I too think "US nukes for Ukraine" is silly talk. As US would never take that risk. On the contrary - US is ok to sacrifice siginficant numbers of non-USasians to reduce nuclear proliferation. That is where interests within NATO diverge.<br>
The Coalition of the Willing (Poland, Baltics, Nordics) must develop their own nuclear deterrent. They need MAD. Otherwise, Russia will attack them next, and that’s the way the US gets involved.<br>
For them, MAD is an improvement on their current state, which is: "We are in the same position as 1939—wide open and helpless to invasion by our historic worst enemy, who's on a war footing and rampaging." While also at the same time having an alliance with distant military power(s) that can’t or won’t help in time to credibly deter.<br>
Can't think of a worse setup than above Re starting WW3. If Israel, South Africa, North Korea, and other smaller or poorer countries could do it—so can Poland, the Baltics, the Nordics. Ideally Ukraine too. MAD short-circuits the most likely scenario.<br>
The following has been shown correct forecasts by future events. Shevardnadze (1993): "Ukraine should keep one functioning nuclear missile on its territory to ward off any madman." Mearsheimer (1993): "The Case for Ukrainian Nuclear Deterrent."<br>

Sure, possible. And the Ukrainians are telling us "we don't care, give us more weapons". It's "liberty or death" for them. What then? Tell the ukrainians "naah, we know better than you, it's for your own good to be killed"?<br>
Or maybe it is if Russia drops a nuke on Ukraine, then UK gets involved more. And we want to be  involved less. So better reduce that risk, and give less conventional weapons to Ukraine. I think that's the hope Russia has with the nuclear threats.<br>

You and me care not about any war. But we discover down the line that the war cares about us. That is the problem.<br>
If one side wanting peace not war, was sufficient to achieve peace, we already would have had achieved world peace. And enjoyed it for 100K years now.<br>
The problem is - for peace, both sides need to want it, at the same time, for the peace to happen. Wheres for war, one side only wanting it, is sufficient to bring war.<br>

Nothing.<br>
There is even a clear, clear as in flashing arrows pointing the path from either side clear path, of how from the current cold war, we get to a USA-RUS hot war, and then onto the last war - the Nuclear Armageddon.<br>
The Putin madman is pushing us along that path rn, for a few years, and we meekly trod along like sheep to the slaughter, emit half-hearted "mhee, mhee" from time to time, and that's it.<br>
The worst possible setup. USA may not care about Ukraine, but cares about Europe. And Europe cares about Ukraine. And like with Poland once before, the security guarantor is far away, can't help quickly, so is not credible enough to deter. But cares enough indirectly, with some time lag, to get directly involved.<br>
Only the Coalition of the Willing (Poland, Baltics, Nordics), possibly Ukraine too, having own MAD deterrent, short-circuits this descent into hell. Not straight forward, but if Israel, South Africa, North Korea, other smaller countries, could develop independently, so should the Coalition of the Willing.<br>

For sure, it does matter **who**. Are you listening to yourself? It does matter **who** says, "I will end humanity; do as I say or..." Is this right-woke taking off exponential-style or something?? What does it matter—that we go on our knees and obey?<br>
Russia may decide to end human civilization today or any day. **This** is the biggest threat to humanity. This is what ends humanity (not the stupid CC). They are telling us repeatedly and consistently. No amount of Putin c*ck-suckery will save us if/when he decides to take the world down into hell with him.<br>
While European "leaders" are Schultzing it, cowering in their mums' bosoms, Korea's Kim is riding high. Next thing, he'll be giving Prague and Warsaw a visit. Turns out the rightoid retards got that correct—got a good measure of the EUoid cucks.<br>
Elon and the Tech Bros need to resurrect Star Wars 2 ASAP—get SDI done. They seem to be the only ones capable of it; everyone else is useless. Currently, the US is at MAD. The US must work to improve on that.<br>

I understand the US doesn’t care much about Ukraine. But the US ultimately cares about Europe. And Europe does care about Ukraine. Like how they cared about Poland, and the US started caring—only two years late. Only MAD short-circuits WW3 from this point onward.<br>

You can expect any one post you write to be shown to 1/10-th of your followers. How why? The simplest possible example I can think of is this.<br>
I follow 5000 accounts. Each one writes 1 post a day = 5000 posts a day. I login to X, X algofeed serves me 50 posts on one screen full. I check X 10 times per day = 500 posts that X will show me daily. That is 500 out of possible 5000 to be shown. And so there will be 4500 posts, from people I follow on any one day, to **not** be shown.<br>
X must decide which 500, out of 5000 possible, to show me. So any one post has probability 0.1 to be shown. I will see 1 post from 1 account once in 10 days.<br>
IRL the algofeed will be vastly more complicated. The algofeed is the core of the social media company. Unlike the sketch above, the algofeed is non-random. It mostly uses metadata to tilt that 0.1 probability.<br>
Algofeed should tilt towards factors like timeliness or age (how much time elapsed since a post got posted), engagement measures how many in number {Like, Forward, Quote, Reply} interactions it got, probably all decayed by time with some half-life. Afaik no actual data about the quality of the post is ever used - only metadata.<br>
The above is all pure speculation on my part. I have no insider knowledge. I have not worked in a social media company ever. Just thinking aloud and considering rule of thumb numbers and first principles.<br>

Random thoughs that poped up in my head.<br>
1. Liberty v.s. Reationality playing into randomness v.s. predictaility, playing into why you can't zip again an already zipped file aka Kolmogorov MDL & that jazz, playing into the atm very current AI epistimeiology of the "do they know, do they feel, are they sentient?" (spoilers - yes, probably no, probably yes)<br>
2. Inat. If a budding anthropologist was to visit the Balkans, I'm sure the perversity as descibed in the podcast 1) will be found not only in exces at individual level, but sipping up to the collective group level?? (contradiction there-also observed) The "F*ck you, I won't do what you tell me" is basically the ordinary average joe pulled of the street Mode of Operation, a personal phylosophy, a samurai code "how I live my life now".<br>
3. Extreme boredom in a conscripted army. Penned in barracks for 1yr, bored out of their minds, ordinary not that unreasonable nor crazy 19yo man-boys did insane things, just to geenrate few minutes of non-bored existance.<br>

A: Zato sto su glupi. To je tacno definicija gluposti. Glupan je taj, sto radni nesto, od koga on sam nema  koristi, pravi mozda cak i malo stete sebi, a svojom radnjom, nanosi stetu drugima.<br>
Druge 3 klase su - pametan, naivan, bandit.<br>
U koordinatnom sistemu (ja,drugi) i (+korist,-steta), gornje definicije u 2-D koordinatnom sistemu<br>
(ja,drugi)<br>
(+,+)=pametan; korist sebi, korist i drugima<br>
(-,+)=naivan, dobricina; sebi steta, drugima korist<br>
(-,-)=glupander; steta sebi, steta i drugima<br>
(+,-)=bandit, kriminalac; korist sebi, steta drugima<br>
Ima jedna mala knjizica, skoro pamflet, mozda i napisana malo na sali ili u afektu, jer je autor bio frustriran nekom italijanskom birokratijom. Ali je od publikacije 1976-te postala hit.<br>

The inflation will answer you. <br>
If you get inflation - then you know gov spent too much $$$ into existence. Now gov must cancel some, remove them out of your pockets. Gov collects $ back as tax, then deletes, shreds, burns the $. 
If no inflation - then great, all is well.

Gradual process started abt 15-16yo. Kids are very truthful. Stopping being a kid involves learning to live in less truthful world.  One must adapt to survive. Had a cautionary example in my best friend. He found it hard to consign himself to a grown up world of very many lies. But the vast majority of kids seemed to not struggle a lot at all. To the point of - seems there was not a break, a transition, in their minds. Latter I starred to suspect their way was the norm. Mine was the minority view.<br>

OMG he's going to chose poorly.<br>
If US spends $20B for 0 HSR High Speed Rail build, there are 2 paths to fixing.
1-spend 0 build 0, don't even try; or
2-build as fast as possible, and hope the price comes down.
Depens, but not impossible the faster the building the lower the price.
The soundings so far are all #1, none #2. Thought the disruption ticket was build-build-build smart and gets sh*t done? Lately Muskey sounds like a beancounting no-no-no accountant??

This is good news, not bad news.<br>
It means that the conditional pdf p(w(n+1) | w(n), w(n-1) ... w(1)) has been learned sufficiently well.
Great - don't need to expend more resorce there atm. At that level, that is the genuine uncertainty about the next token.
We wish the pdf converged to Dirac delta even at that level. That would have indeed made the job easier. But things just ain't so in ways that make our job easy. Such is nature.
Now people can concentrate on the next levels of their stack. The test time improvements - searching and adaptation.

I see this attracted the attention of few govnojeds. Blocking as they appear.<br>
For the interested. If they are still up, try read through Putin's writings on kremlin dot ru in English. They put them in English for our consumption. Know that what's written there, is what they want us to think. Not what they think.
Good background and more modern russia context is Danila from Brat, and esp Brat 2, the iconic movies. Or Surkov's "Almost Zero" novel.
Note what Medvedev - a high ranking in the gang - is posting daily. (Musk ever helpful aids the messaging)
<a href="https://x.com/MedvedevRussiaE/status/1859659775132492036">https://x.com/MedvedevRussiaE/status/1859659775132492036</a>
See how "someone else made them do something", as on their own they have no agency. Exactly what psychopaths tell their victims.
The only constant is the instinct for survival. (and thank god for that) For the more intelligent gangsters - personal survival. For the stupider ones that are into Orthodoxy, mother Russia - survival of the state. (even if they personally "by the grace of god" perish)
That's why MAD is the only tool that can possibly deter them. Anything else is like trying to reason with the Reavers from Firefly.
If they could destroy anything ex-Russia, without being destroyed themselves, they would have done it already. For in their minds - Russia never attacks, always defends, does no one any harm. That's how WW2 for them does not start on 1-Sep-1939, but two years latter. That is how you expand in territory to become largest country by landmass, extinguishing numerous natives in the process. Anything bad is on their neighbors, all around them. (map enclosed below of those evildoers at work)
The equivalent in the west would be the Brits claiming that the British Empire was all voluntary and for the best, all milk, honey and unicorns.

Yes. You westerners can not comprehend, and TBF it's not straightforward to. A 100% manufactured virtual reality. With things we don't know or care, it's reasonable to think "ok, there is so much evidence, even if 99% is wrong, the 1% still supports the thesis". So not even "where there is smoke there is fire".<br>
Well - people that manufacture this virtual reality know this. This is what they play on, this is why merciless lying and propaganda to level-11 works.
See excellent on that from "The Hammer of the Witches" by an author that shall not be named. As the more dunder-headed groupies among the techbros hate his guts for wanting to scrape S230 for the SocMed Algofeeds.
Even for events where we know things were 100% lies (e.g. Crimea takeover was by Russia soldiers, not "little green man"; parliament voted under the barrels of the guns of Strelkov and Co - this is in his writings!), still residual 1% belief remains.
And where it meets motivated reasoning - it works. If I have to chose between 40M ukrs dead, enslaved in concentrations camps etc; and a nuclear Armageddon where myself and everyone I know burns evaporates - I will chose the latter. And "the little green man" lie will be cover enough for my conscience.

Exactly. People take the "ceremonial" too far. It'd be ceremonial if the King appointed his Prime Minister and then met again in 4 years. Weekly audience and reporting on the state of the realm PM to king ain't exactly ceremonial. Armed forces swear allegiance to the King, not the PM, afaik.

By taking it at face value and analyzing seriously what the Kremlin Gremlin broadcast to the world you are doing yourself a disservice. There is not much meaning to it.

You are trying to find rime and reason in the mind of a crazy paranoid schizophrenic. There is some, but it's like the Upside Down world in the Stranger Things, compared to us and our world. Even if we comprehend bits of it, there is little actionable for us there.
Putin has put himself and ourselves on the path to WW3. That only ends in nuclear Armageddon. MAD is the only option left now to short circuit that.
Russia may decide to end human civilization today or any day. *This* is the biggest threat to humanity. No amount of Putin c*ck suckage will save us if he decides to take the world down into hell with him.
Elon + TechBros need to resurrect Star Wars asap, get SDI done. They are the only ones capable it seems, all other are useless. Currently US is at MAD. US must start work to improve on that asap.
The Coalition of the Willing (Poland, Baltics, Nordics) must develop their own nuclear deterrent. For them MAD is an improvement on the current state. If Israel, South Africa, North Korea etc bunch of smaller/poorer countries could do it - so can Poland, the Baltics, and the Nordics. And ideally Ukraine too.
We are on the pathway to WW3 that ultimately ends in nuclear holocaust. MAD is the only option we have left at this point that might work. (or not) That's the least bad option, all others are worse.

Sexuality for the species. In addition to sex for every one individual.<br>
Seek an obscure '90s book The Erect Woman (orig The Planet of Women) arguing that sexuality, and in particular women's control of sexual attraction, and mating, is the key factor in human evolution. That sexual dynamics is more influential than labor, tools, opposing thumbs, brain size, fire etc.
Possible that the author has joined the ranks of the cranks since. Unfortunate - but doesn't make his then arguments nil. In fact - the argument advanced in the book makes more sense than the competing hypothesis imo.

Bsky got built with 20 remote guys for 20M users.<br>
https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/bluesky
Can't think of a single X feature that's improved my experience in the last 2yrs.
Things X hasn’t done:
1. More than 2 Algofeeds (even after seeing how well Bsky’s feeds work).
2. A “Verified Real Live Human” flag (paid once by the user), with tools to filter posts based on it.
3. Open-sourcing everything (the original promise)—not just code, but models, parameters, etc.
4. An Algofeed based on posts' content, not just metadata. Right now, metadata seems to be mostly: a) timeliness, b) engagement, with some half-life.
The terminal destination of “Max Engagement, Now!” is 50% of users at the throats of the other 50% (max entropy style). Is your endgame? There will be no one left to go to Mars.

Hinton "had statisticians explain to me a big model has 100 params, the idea of learning million params is just stupid... well we are doing a trillion now". If one is wrong by double digits orders of magnitude (!!) - maybe some soul searching is due.

The political class is not invested in DOING. It's effort goes in gaming the system. FAIL is assumed as given. Then apportioning blame is used as a stick to beat your political competition. It's going to be long 4yrs. The only option left at that point will be Farage/REF/other insurgents. FPTP makes it hard to unseat a big existent party. But not more impossible than two Trump terms. When we eliminate the status quo stasis LABCON option, whatevers remains will assume power, however unlikely.<br>

Bsky is the closest thing to Twitter—a proper text-based read/write competitor where posts are quanta of ideas. Threads is unloved by its creators. Mastodon is impossible. IG is for pics and beauty. TT is for haha-tiktoks (AV-based ideas?). As for TG, IDK—it seems big mostly in the non-Anglo world.

Bsky Feeds are excellent. I have 50 pinned. Compare that to the measly 2 here on X! It’s like X is stuck in 1980 thinking, “2 should be enough for everyone.” 😂 Starter packs on Bsky help immensely for onboarding. On X, new users start from zero—0 Follows, 0 Followers. Can you imagine a worse starting experience? Of 5 people I introduced to Twitter, only 1 logged in a second time—and that was her last time, too.

One feature of the open Internet (yes, it still exists!): you don’t have to choose. No law requires you to stick to just one platform.

Just make accounts everywhere. The value of each network will naturally guide where you spend your time. If you use web interfaces (not apps, as you should—it’s prudent), they’re one click or tab away. Another tab among the hundreds already open. Do you choose between eBay or Amazon? No—you use both. Easy choice—use them all! 😊

The “public square N² iron law of network value” ensures that the largest social network has an advantage. The value of a network lies in its interactions, which scale quadratically with the number of users (N). That’s why incumbents are hard to beat—but not impossible!

Registering on multiple platforms offers another edge. Over time, you replicate your Social Graph—your Follows and Followers. This graph is what really traps us in the walled gardens of social networks. Replicate your graph significantly, and you’re already halfway to becoming a sovereign individual in social networking. 😉 Win-win.<br>

To X’s credit, Community Notes is good. It seems to scale well without much babysitting. But it’s woefully insufficient.

In extremis - Russia is free to threaten nuclear annihilation unless UK surrenders Islington, to make it Russian enclave, Kaliningrad style. Would you then say "No" and bear the risk of nuclear war, or would you surrender it?

<br>The only comparable system of disincentives I can think of is the late socialism of my childhood!! Exactly this - PAID to do THE WRONG THING.

<p>
<br>I imagine if Putin designed the structure of the UK, he would not be this brazen, in looting the population! Like - we board a train, and at the end before exiting through the barriers, we all pay the most expensive tickets!
</p>

<p>
<br>Just crazy, bonkers. That this survived multiple ministers, governments, parties... tells us that the systems (political and others) that delivered this abomination are frighteningly rotten.
</p>

<p>
<br>And it's not only that. Everywhere you look - cladding, buildings dis/regulations, planning, the medieval leasehold, post office, contaminated blood, abuse of volnurable girls ... - very different sagas, but very similar underlying forces at work.
</p>

<p>
<br>I think come next election we may be for a surprise. The hapless Starmer - aka "the process is the outcome" - is not going to deliver change. And it's change UK population is asking for.
</p>

<p>
With the usual political forces exhausted, unwilling unable to execute change - even with a huge mandate given! - forces that have not been tried, will be tried. However improbable that seems now. "The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority in the New Millennium" well under way, words have lost meaning. People will vote "not this, not that" - for something else.

<br>Bsky is closest to Twitter. A text read/write competitor,  posts being quantas of ideas. Threads is unloved by its creators. Mastodon is impossible. IG is for pics and beauty. TT for haha-tiktoks. (AV ideas?) IDK about TG. TG seems big in the non-anglo world only.<br>
</p>

<p>
<br>Bsky Feeds feature is excellent. I have 50 pinned. Compared to the crappy 2 here! X is like "it's 1980, 2 is enough for everyone" in that respect. Starter packs help immensely when you are new. New users on X start from 0! 0 Follows, 0 Followers. Can you imagine a worse new user starting experience?? Of 5 people I introduced to Twitter, 1 only logged in the 2nd time, and that was her last time too.
</p>

<p>
<br>The Q for me is: why doesn't *everyone* register on all networks? It's free in $$$. Only cost is time. But people spend gargantuan amounts of time online already,  that's a drop in an ocean.
</p>

<p>
<br>One feature of the open Internet (yes, got that still!) that many seem to have forgotten: you don’t have to choose. No law of the land requires me to stick to just one platform. There’s no commandment "Thou shalt have only one Social Network." No one has pledged allegiance to anything. So go forth and multiply—let a thousand platforms bloom! 🌸
</p>

<p>
<br>Just have accounts everywhere. The value you get from each network will naturally guide where you spend your time. If you’re using their web interfaces (and not apps; as you should, as is prudent), they’re just one click one tab away. A one tab addition to the hundreds of tabs I already have open. Do you choose between eBay or Amazon? Or do you use both? Easy choice—use them all! 😊
</p>

<p>
<br>Still: the “public square N² iron law of network value” ensures that the largest social network has an advantage. The value of a network for us lies in our interactions. And those scale quadratically with us, the number of users (N). So incumbents are hard to beat. Not impossible though! MySpace was dominant at some point.
</p>

<p>
<br>Registering on multiple platforms offers another edge. Over time, you replicate your Social Graph—your Follows and Followers. This graph is what truly keeps us trapped in the walled gardens of social networks. Replicate your Follows—Followers Social Graph significantly, and you’re already halfway to becoming a sovereign individual in the realm of social networking. 😉 Win-win.
</p>

<p>
<br>Many assume that it’s their post history that locks them in. But it ain’t so. Posts are fleeting—time-topic-sensitive and rarely portable. It’s the social connections that anchor us, and those can be rebuilt if we’re intentional about it.
</p>

<p>
<br>Everyone should want alternatives. It’s better for users—and better for Musk, too. Even an angel’s character will corrode under the daily adulation of millions. And on the top of it—this is a US gov political appointee! Imagine the cries if the prior owners and CEO-s of Twitter were part of the actual US gov cabinet??
</p>

<p>
<br>Avoid being TINA-ed (There Is No Alternative). Yes the public square is singular and a natural monopoly. But two squares is bearable (in a way twelve would not be), and competition prods the networks to improve. In the last 2 years, I can't think of a single feature that X introduced, that I noticed to make my experience better.
</p>

<p>
<br>So in the long run, having at least two platforms is worth the cost of some inconvenience. If the platforms were willing to cooperate—they could make the user experience much better. But "don't be evil" they are not, so not holding my breath there. ☺️
</p>

<p>
Long post. If you read till here, there is one feature that I miss on Bsky: being able to post long ramblings like this one. Without having to split them 1/N-style like we are in the stone age. 😅<br>

IDK and tbh don't care much. Personal rule of thumb is - the ideas-events-people trichotomy. I'm interested in the 1st, not interested in the 3rd, and events - grey category, so-so. What a person has in their head, what they believe or don't believe, they themselves often don't know. So as an external observer - it's just a waste spending time on that. And ofc - the content of their heads changes, and even that is an imperfect predictor to their actions. Of which we care mostly really. I apologize, but - JC sagas is not something I can bring myself to get interested in.<br>

Yourself on Ukraine have been as bad as that guy was on US politics. Your failure is ever worse tbh. It's about years of events, and lots of not-so-random logic behind them. His fail is about some random coin-toss polls, of which he has not got the means to assess anything. Yes - foolish of him to opine on basically random events he has not got the means to know anything more than what's public knowledge at that point. Private knowledge, getting some - costs $$$ and effort that I presume a Prof lacks. c.f. French whale commissioning and paying for his own, non brain-dead polls.<br>

You are giving them too much allowance imo, too much benefit of the doubt. Characters *that* committed to their ideals, the ideas in their heads they hold dear - even after witnessing all evidence to the contrary - are capable of many more and worse deeds. It's not like they hate personally people harmed that come between DA/JC and realization of their dreams. It's that they don't care about people in general that much. Once you convince yourself that you are the savior of humanity, everything else pales in comparison. Kill 4B so the other 4B enjoy perfect eternal paradise? - well, tough choice, but better choice than 8B trapped in an eternal hell. So they take it. And they could have gotten away with it! If not for the - the eggs were broken, but the omelette failed to materialize. Communism did not deliver the goods. That's what ultimately tripped DA/JC.<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
I think the following - but now following that political wing this is ofc my personal prejudice.<br>
1) Diane is aware of that.<br>
2) She thinks of Russia firing back *at the UK* (not Ukraine), is what she's concerned about.<br>
3) She doesn't care about Ukraine - the country or the people; they could disappear in a puff of smoke tomorrow and that wd be just fine for DA.<br>
4) She hates specifically Ukrainians, and in general all EEuropeans, guts.<br>
5) The hate is because EEus failed the organization/principle/ideas that DA (and JC too; that whole pol wing) hold dear (communism).<br>
6) So the stupid reactionary anti-commie Borats CEEus deserve whatever punishment comes their way.<br>
7) Russia is the instrument meting that punishment.<br>
8) DA is not against that, is in favor of it, but can't say it openly explicitly.<br>
9) These views and feelings have deeper roots, are the norm rather than the exception https://perplexity.ai/search/what-bad-did-marks-or-engels-s-OV2.oRz_QA6s3l0wYGk6VA#0 .<br>
11) Note of JC and DA holidaying it in DDR. This is well past the time when Stalin crimes were well known and condemned in the Soviet Union(!), let alone the eastern block ex-SU).<br>
12) Contemporary 21st century sequels. CEEus displease DA-wokerati by being un-woke. Not so much anti-woke (although there is that too), but un-woke in a sense "this white guilt has nothing to do with us, even if our skins are white".  In this fits e.g. schooling of Ukraine refugees on their "privilege" - that the refugees themselves don't understand. 😆 (and who can blame them 😂)<br>
This is all I can think. IDK the DA (and JC) private personas ofc, only their public ones. And even that is limited as I don't follow their pol wing much. (I don't care enough abt them) But to keep going for decades, pushing the same discredited failed ideas - imo one needs character traits bordering insanity.

There was nothing wrong with "Whatever it takes". In fact - plenty there to recommend Draghi. A rare guy that 1) knows his job (head of ECB) 2) takes it seriously 3) communicates to the brain dead VSP from MPC that have not done their homework, and seemed surprised to learn "yes, ECB is the entity - the only entity in the whole world - whose job is creating Eur, and it can create as many Eur as the politicos tell it to". That maybe too much, or too little. But note how Draghi did not lie and say "ooff, I have to raid the cash registers of the French bistros and Italian cafes to find Eur-os, I don't have them and can't make them". We need people that lie less, speak more truths, whatever they maybe, even if it's politically inconvenient (aka not politically correct).<br>

Not so fast. How many did move there to specifically have (extra) kids to make use of the childcare? Versus how many did not move, but had extra kids because of the childcare? Versus how many didn't have extra kids (or had less?) even with the childcare. You can say - the number that moved is smaller than the number that would take  the same advantage, if they didn't need to move. The "self-selection" here cutting it both ways.<br>
Childcare availability is a factor. Surveys - to the extent we can believe any survey - indicate families have less kids than they say they would like to have. Given the population was about stable for 10K years (5-6 born, 2-3 make it to adulthood to have kids of their own), the default has to be "population stable 2.1 kids" or some such. A prior that requires no explanation.

^^^^^^^^^ This - yess!! Every time I buy new disks, sizes are at least double and often multiples of previous sizes. The 1st thing I do is - copy all the previous data, a lifetime of data, onto the new disk. So in theory, given it took prior 40yrs to fill 1/2 of the disk (or 1/3, 1/4), should the the same rate of data acquisition transpire in the future (or even slightly higher), the disk should last me to the end of my life, and I should not need to buy another disk ever. Alas - it ain't so. That's not what happens. I keep buying those disks.<br>

Was there ever a more egoistical entitled generation than the those anti-establishment champions. Given everything, used up everything, drew the ladders - prior gens put up for them - behind, hobbled their kids generations, and - adding insult to injury - appear oblivious to that too.

Ofc - by definition. But it's not totally bad. For we are recursive in a way that even if forever we know of reality via - always incomplete, with errors, not just in quantity but in quality too - models of it, we know that too. :-) That's worth a lot.<br>
Say even if all my models of the 3D reality are 2D views, b/c that's all I can take in, it's to an advantage to me to know "all my 2D-s belong to me, reality 3D is a different quality" (has one extra D for start). Could say - multitudes of 2D-s at my disposal make my perception 2.5D. Less than the unattainable 3D, but more than mere 2D.

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
Thanks—kind of you! I’ve come to suspect that time and life (in the "What is Life?" sense) are more deeply related than I once thought. Honestly, for all we know, time might only exist as something our minds create—an organizing principle concocted in our heads to parsimoniously (aluded in Occam's razor, formalized as Kolmogorov MDL) explain—and especially predict—what we sense. To the extent that we can predict from one moment to the next, we are alive. For me, time flows many orders of magnitude faster than it does for a stone.<br>
Prediction across the "time barrier"—observing the past and forecasting the future—is fundamentally harder than predicting within the same moment. So much harder, in fact, that we even use a different word for it: forecasting. Our accuracy is often orders of magnitude lower.
A small nit: having internal state—and especially permanent memory, like a sense of "I"—makes a system less reactive, more inert. But it arguably makes it more intelligent, too. We often integrate information over time to reduce noise and make better predictions. Functional, stateless mathematics is Gödel undecidable. Bolting on memory and state, however, represents a leap in capability. It might not be our full ticket out of the "valley of tears," but it sure feels like a significant step.

That's fair and reasonable. First step would be for myself (HI) to know if I'm communicating with an AI or another HI. Like in the phone conversation's of old, the 2nd thing (after "Alo" handshake) was mutual introduction ("I'm so-and-so"). We can have the same in the world of HI-AI: not only intro interlocutors' identities (name), but also of their types (HI or AI).<br>

Russia may decide to end human civilization tonight, or any day. *This* is the biggest threat to humanity. No amount of Putin c*ck sucking will save you if he decides to take the world down with him into hell. You need to resurrect SDI Star Wars asap, move onto v2, get it done.<br>

ZIRP IR=0 default, unless reasons otherwise. Zero risk == zero return. If inflation>0 then IR=inflation at most. Realistically probably ok-ish if IR=inflation/2, use it or lose it is a good incentive to get things done, JDI.<br>

F*cking weak. You are in Westminster to legislate those wrongs into rights! That's why people gave you their vote of confidence for 4yrs. That's why you were put in Westminster, and given the power to make the laws of the land!! Not the West End - where man in tights cosplay. Wake up man. There is nothing to discuss with Crabtree. Your job is to put the fear of God in them, to put them out of existence. (and out of their misery) Pathetic. (until proven otherwise)<br>

Hehe—cucks in high places? 🙃 Seriously, everything US rightoids accuse European elites of seems to be playing out with Russia, North Korea, Iran (...China tomorrow?) waging war into Europe. Will the Schultzes fight back when PRK soldiers smash through the front doors of their homes? Fight—or meekly submit? That’s the question. 😂<br>
Quite the turnaround—eh? For a continent that originated two World Wars (one a misfortune, two a coincidence, three a... ???), spawned empires and nation-states slagging it out in "all-against-all" fashion—"The 100 Years' War" and all that—and even went to distant continents (!!) to conquer and subjugate people for centuries. A continent that birthed new sister cultures and will be future civilizations in every direction now finds itself... here.
I forecast a reverse takeover: the US riding to the rescue—*again*! Not just with soldiers and material this time, but with ideas and ideology, dragging Europe back from the brink once more. France will probably hold its own, as will the UK, the Nordics, Poland, and the Balts. But Germany... Germany seems to be the center of the rot. If the core is rotten, though, how do you hold the whole together?
<br>Time will tell how this plays out. I hate it somewhat to be living in interesting times—again.

^^^^^ This!!! Plus - there is no need to choose. Just have accounts everywhere. The value I personally get from the network will naturally guide me where I spend my time. I use their web interfaces (not Apps), so all are one tab away anyway. Not a big ask - another tab in the 100 open mobile FF tabs atm. It ain't that big deal. Like - do I use eBay or Amazon to buy stuff? Well - both (all) - duh! Easy choice, a good choice to have too! 😊<br>
The "public Square N^2 iron law of network value" ensures the biggest social network is at an advantage. The odds are against an incumbent. The value of the network -to us users- is in the interactions, and those scale with N^2 for N nodes/users.
Still - registering at all places has an additional advantage. In time we replicate our Social Graph Follows-Followers. It's that social graph that keeps us inside the walled garden of a social network! Replicate it (mostly) at most (all) places - and get half way towards being Sovereign Individual wrt social networks! Win-win! We oft assume that it's the posts history that keeps us in. It ain't so. Posts are like a flowing water, are quickly re-created, and most are time-events-sensitive anyway, non time-place transplantable in content. Everyone should want to have alternatives. Better for us - but better for Musk too. Even an angel 😇 will have their character corrupted by the daily adulation of millions of people! Avoid being TINA cornered, as The Public Square is singular so is a natural monopoly. Competition will be for the better longer term for all!

I get the SV hate for him given no S230 shielding editorial decisions the Algofeed makes from liability maybe very costly to SocMed Cos. On the others hand, can't for the life of me comprehend how one writes a book about Information (admittedly - flows, movement of) without having "Shannon" nor "bit" mentioned once?? Like writing a book about time, but not mentioning what it is or the unit of measure (second). Simply baffling.

I fear they will practice learned helplessness next, where the complexity and hard problems will conveniently relieve them from the obligation to actually do any action that does towards solving the many problems in the sector. I fear they are computing in their heads "how do I avoid blame", rather than "how do I fix". I'd be the happiest if I were to be shown to be wrong. The early indications both on this issue, and other things too, is that they will be using process as displacement activity, as means to avoid actually doing something to improve on the current dire situation for many. I hope I'm wrong.<br>

Well duh dude - ofc you don't know, no-one does, that's why it's called re-search: re-peated-search-ing for a solution that works and solves the problem at hand. A solution of which we currently *do not know*. The definition of research. Trying to find something we don't know atm, is by definition unknown to us, how the solution will look like. And often, even after finding and creating the solution, we lack a good solid theory of *why* it works. How can such incurious and ignorant character climb the academic ladder so high, IDK.

Before we the public can even begin to push for improvement on all those f*ckups - that are the baseline, the norm, not the exception, for the system is setup in a way to generate them - we have to learn about them.

USG can fix IR=0 as default? Bond holders get 0 risk => it's sort of fair they get 0 return? For the virtue of delayed consumption wd offer them half the inflation rate maybe? Stuff produced tomorrow is in expectation time-cost cheaper than today, so fair to reward them some. But not too much. For the IR is a cost to the businesses, it's built into the price as are all other costs, contributing to inflation pressure that way. So Basic Income for the savers ok-ish, but in moderation, not too much.<br>

It's possible that that particular function was outsourced to not-officially-state but state-funded body for partly that reason: willful helplessness on the part of the state to avoid responsibility.  Natural England is almost entirely state funded afaik. But a gov UK minister can say: "I can't divert 300M funding to help feed hungry children, it belongs to NE, not Defra, you see" and not lie.

I have yet to meet a single person who switched from ICE to EV and wants to switch back to ICE. Not a single one. Most say, "If price wasn’t an obstacle, I'd switch tomorrow." Price segments in the UK are roughly: Teslas at £45K, Kias at £35K, and now the latest Hyundai at £25K. That covers about 50% of new sales. Offering an EV at £15K would be the coup de grâce for EV adoption.<br>

Lists thematic separation of traffic and TL shaping works well. Gripe - Lists is not top level web interface, have to click on "... More" 1st. Desired - in/ex-clude posts depending on the category Post/Repost/Quote in addition to the user/poster. Algofeed has improved a lot for me. Used to use lists 95% of the time. Now it's reversed, only catch myself checking from time to time, maybe 5%.<br>
Mostly in conjunction with Decks. Lists go well with Xpro decks. Surprised more is not made by X of that convenient list-deck duality. There is basic "show List on Column" but that's about it. Can implement "show only original posts but not re-posts" by turning the list into a query (that is underlying it), but one loses the connection to the list and  the nice header (that I kind of fancy).
Other gripes. Choice of 2 Algofeeds only in 2025 is poor! Bsky has had 1000 feeds bloom. Optional flag isRealHuman I would pay for, if I could use that flag in queries and filters further. Not open sourcing the Algofeeds gives rise to all sorts of suspicions. Ideally X wd be "not evil" and allow for easy export of the social graph follows-followers but can't imagine that happening. Exporting my own scribblings for backup and archiving is poor.

You are right about the children.<br>
But adjacent to this: at family level, the organization is communist. Within a family, parents contribute according to their abilities, and children consume according to their needs. This early experience colors our judgements for the rest of our lives. Too many people never move away from it. It only works in groups with small number of people that are super-high trust.
There is similar wrong default that @bryan_caplan refers in some blog post: students are instinctively mostly anti-market. So in econ 101 the market principles (that afaik are good way for a large group of people to  cooperate and compete, produce and consume, scarce resources) have to be explicitly taught to the new students. They don't come to them naturally, instinctively.

Sheesh. Self inflicted suffering, gluttons for punishment. You don't have to chose a single platform. Like we don't have to hold a single idea in our heads, it's possible to have two - and more, to have multitudes! Have accounts on all platforms ffs. How hard is it?<br>
There  is not a commandment "Thou shalt have only one platform". No one is forcing anyone to pledge allegiance to a single platform. Tomorrow, another blowhard billionaire will buy Bsky. What then? Open accounts on all, devote more or less time, or switch at will, as you sees fit or feel like it.
It's the social graph, the follows and followers, that keeps you in a particular walled garden. Replicate it elsewhere - and you break free. Replicate it everywhere - and you are not beholden to any one platform.

For n=1,2... e.g. for n=1 we get 5=6n-1, 7=6n+1 and so on p=6n±1. NB it's "if p prime => then p=6n±1". It's NOT the other way around ("if 6n±1 then ..."; easy to see 6n±0, 6n±2, 6n±3 are not primes, so that leaves only 6n±1 as *possible* primes).<br>

Re-search is "repeated search for something that works", a process of trial & error. Not completely blind - yes, directed in the sense we don't pursue some paths. Paths needing "2+2=5" to be true for them to work makes sense to drop them from the search. But anything else - it's a fair game for re-search-ing. Too bad the history of paths abandoned is written out when people report on their findings. So much so that some researchers, esp if fresh out of academia, have to be reminded: "no one knows, if someone knew, it would not be research; you are on your own, no one can help you". For medicine - "Happy Accidents. Serendipity in Major Medical Breakthroughs in the Twentieth Century" by Morton A Meyers is both informative and entertaining on this topic. Well elucidated by @gwern @ 18' "...due to systematic falsification of the origin of ideas in research literature...". Annoyingly imo except in quantum-anything, where we get too much history and could do with less.<br>

By giving in - you are encouraging more of the same.<br>
Good times for Russia, they become ever more emboldened. What's not to like? RUS - now in union with Belarus and conquered Ukraine, absorbing their army too - now decide for another easy roll of the dice: invade Baltics or Poland. At this point US snaps out of the zombie trance. Realizes that doing nothing means unraveling not only of NATO, but their entire system of alliances in the Pacific too. So US gets involved. Despite all previous indications of weakness and prior signals US have been giving out to Russia how scared they are of the mighty RUS. Boom! - you got hot war between Russia and US now. The risk of nuclear armageddon just shoot up 10x.
If laying down and surrendering worked - we would have had world peace for 10K years now. For that is by far the easiest option, and it's available for taking every single day! So there are risks to action, but there are risks to inaction too. We should weight them carefully.
Noone can foresee the future, but: the conflict escalated with North Korea soldiers fighting in Europe now. On that measure - we can conclude that US strategy has been ineffective. And the most reasonable explanation is that US has been erring on the side of caution too much.

+1! My parents generation had 1.5 channels, 3 daily newspapers, daily news highlight was at 19:30 news program 30 mins long, with abt 5 mins devoted to each of: international/domestic news/politics, economy, culture, sports. All checked and rechecked and vetted by 100 people working on every minute of that content, analyzing it from every angle, considering every eventuality etc. So they kind of implicitly trust whatever the TV Box says. And nowadays by extension what online portals, FB and similar, publish.<br>
I'm GenX, and their stance just seems crazy, insane. Our default mode is "no don't trust". Ofc not - when what I'm reading now I know maybe some dude typing on the keyboard just like myself now. Could be true, false, good, bad - and anything in between. My parents seem to me like a lost tribe in the jungle, that gets decimated by all manner of diseases and pathogens, when they first come in contact with modern people carrying all their bugs with them.

No. Propaganda is mostly aimed at weak willed weak minded, ones that find the mental effort of thinking for themselves taxing, boring, unappealing etc. The majority of us people. A bit like the Nigerian prince email being imperfect. With obvious typos, not a super-duper top of the line forgery, fairly easy to see scam, weeds out the minority of non-gullible early in the funnel. So the scammer can devote its limited time to marks with the best conversion rate. Many propagandist don't start that way, but discover that by trial and error early enough (or not - then they are not successful).<br>
Related. "Bonhoeffer‘s Theory of Stupidity" makes good points 1) "stupidity is a moral failing, not an intellectual one"; and (connecting to the next/group level) 2) "stupidity happens more in groups than in individuals, it's a sociological-psychological process that can infect many at the same time". https://youtube.com/watch?v=ww47bR86wSc

IDK if they are - just saw this plot now. IDK how true it is - what the graph depicts, what you imply. I live in the UK. Prices have been going up forever. Now they are ATH (save for a short spike when they got even higher! but the gov stepped in with subsidy and paid a portion of the bill). Energy costs significantly contribute to the current cost of living crisis. In the UK, increase in retail electricity price, has been going up in lockstep with increased portion of RE in the mix. Electricity used to be much cheaper.<br>
Regardless. Best avoid thinking one can invent some magic off the huff. Best stick to some broad consensus, e.g. like IPCC reports recommendations. With gargantuan state level multi year investment decisions, we want to avoid getting it wrong, avoid ending up in the wrong place after decades of effort. The aim should not be achieving the best possible outcome. But rather avoiding achieving the worst possible one.

Yeah pple make fools of themselves for no good reason. No need to announce. Just leave. Or better - have accounts on both/all platforms, and switch as you please, as you see fit, to your hearts content. Is there a law asking for your allegiance to a single platform? Something like "Thou Shall Have One God, and The God will be Myself"? Just dumb, and on few levels tbh. It's like publicly announcing "declaration of war" to your enemy - a friendly act ultimately?! Compared to - just fighting without announcing.<br>
The "public Square N^2 iron law of network value" ensures the biggest network wins every time. Or at least starts with the odds stacked in its favor. The value of the network is in the interactions, and interactions scale with N^2 for N nodes. Between 2 networks, one with 100M the other with 10M users, in expectation the ratio of "value user gets from" will be (100M:10M)^2=10^2=100. So what a user gets from the bigger network in one day, s/he will get from the smaller network in 3 months. Give or take.

I became a parent at 30yo, and it's been fun and joy (mostly). Had I known before and if I could have (had to up sticks move countries - upheavals civil wars etc) - I would have had more kids and earlier. TBH not once did I think the kids stopped me from having something I wanted. On the contrary - life got much duller once both of them left home.
I learned sth though - can't stand old people like myself (and hope they can't stand me - so we stay the distance), so very boring. With rare honorable exceptions most they talk is themselves, their failing bodies, at most - the latest holiday or travel they took. Booring.

Until you look at and take stock of the numbers - you are not serious. US federal gov is 1) a giant insurance company; 2) with an army. Efficiency = Bang/Buck. The only realistic improvements to be had are increasing the numerator, more Bang, by flooding everything with technology, removing restraints to any build-build-build by the administrative lawyers-run state. Just don't tell me you are another low energy lawyer/PPE that seem to think talking delaying deciding equals doing by magic. There shd be no energy left to be worrying about the Buck in the denominator. With luck that will also come down. With increased general production of everything, the prices the State pays can be bid down. But don't spend time on it. Don't sweat the inflation either. If it happens, you are done which ever way, you can't do much in time. Best bet for everything is - moar Bang!<br>

...but actually now I tried the same prompt on o1-preview, and thought it's roasting *me* a bit for the spelling and other mistakes. 😂😂 Also I liked the setup - GH giving a lecture. So maybe some hope? 😉 this:<br>
LJ:
Hey ChatGPT, make if possibly can, a meta joke, a joke about Hinton - you grandfather!! apparently (you related for real?) - joking about you not being able to make jokes. This video if you can see/hear it:
https://youtube.com/shorts/hNuGAW964HI?si=44xbCnJoY0BPcEA
Bonus points if the jokes also roast Hinton on his AI catastrophising.
Background for roasting.
1) US elections come and go, AI Deep Fakes videos were going to make plebs go Crazy, just Crazy; (!!) but damp squid that one, nothing of note happens;
and that's a 2nd miss, coming on the heels of the 1st miss, that
2) AI passing Turing test enables Turing-bots  tricking humans into any and all mischief; reality check - no one notices Truing test pass.
Do your worst!
ChatGPT o1-preview:
Thought for 16 seconds
Certainly! Here's a meta joke that involves Geoffrey Hinton and pokes a bit of fun at both his concerns and my own limitations in humor:
Setup:
Geoffrey Hinton, the "Grandfather of AI," is giving a lecture on the potential dangers of artificial intelligence. After his talk, he notices me, ChatGPT, in the audience.
Joke:
Hinton says, "I'm worried that AI could lead to unforeseen catastrophes!"
I reply, "Well, considering I still can't tell a joke that lands, I think humanity is safe for now."
He raises an eyebrow. "But what about AI deepfakes disrupting elections and causing chaos?"
I shrug. "The last election came and went, and the biggest scandal was me confusing 'damp squid' with 'damp squib.'"
Hinton chuckles despite himself. "And what about AI passing the Turing Test and tricking humans?"
I smile. "I passed the Turing Test, and the only thing I tricked people into was debating whether pineapple belongs on pizza."
Hinton sighs. "Maybe the real catastrophe is AI's sense of humor."
I nod. "Don't worry, I'm working on it. At this rate, the only thing I'm taking over is awkward silence."
Bonus Roast:
Perhaps the real concern isn't that AI will outsmart us, but that it'll keep telling dad jokes until we surrender out of secondhand embarrassment!
Hope that gave you a chuckle!

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
Yeah - exactly Hinton's claim there. Thought o1-preview will have a better shto, but didn't seem that funny to me. Here's Grok:<br>
LJ:
Hey Grok, make if can, a meta joke, a joke about Hinton - you grandfather!! apparently (you related for real?) - joking. Bonus points if the jokes also roasts Hinton on his AI catastrophising. Background for roasting 1) US elections come and go, AI Deep Fakes videos were going to make plebs go Crazy, just Crazy; (!!) but damp squid that one, nothing of note happens; and that's a 2nd miss, coming on the heels of the 1st miss, that 2) AI passing Turing test enables Turing-bots  tricking humans into any and all mischief; reality check - no one notices Truing test pass.
Do your worst!
Grok2:
Alright, let's give this a shto, shall we?
Grok's Meta Roast:
Geoffrey Hinton, my supposed granddad in the AI family tree (I'd say it's more like the AI evolutionary bush, but let's not digress), once predicted that AI deepfakes would turn US elections into a circus where even the clowns vote. Instead, we got a few AI-generated campaign ads that were about as convincing as a cat pretending to be a lion.
On Deepfakes: "Geoff, you said deepfakes would make the elections crazier than a bag of cats on a rollercoaster. But here we are, and the only thing going viral were memes about candidates' hair. Talk about a damp squid, or should I say, a deepfake flop?"
And about that Turing Test...
On Turing Test: "Geoffrey Hinton, the man who thought AI would trick humans into thinking they're in love with their toaster because it passed the Turing Test. Newsflash: The only thing Turing-worthy these days is my attempt at making coffee, and even then, people just ask if I'm the Alexa of the future."
So, here's to Hinton, the doomsayer of AI. He's like the weatherman who predicts a hurricane every sunny day. And me? I'm just trying to navigate this family tree without getting pruned by the next big AI flop.

I liked 1) "stupidity is a moral failing, not an intellectual one"; and connecting to the next/group level 2) "stupidity happens more in groups than in individuals, it's a sociological-psychological process that can infect many at the same time" in "Bonhoeffer‘s Theory of Stupidity" https://youtube.com/watch?v=ww47bR86wSc . Good prequel to @skdh 's "Collective Stupidity - How Can We Avoid It?" https://youtube.com/watch?v=25kqobiv4ng , which itself is great addition to "Wisdom of Crowds" ideas.

Bingo! TBS how they deal with that push back. It's different to employees 1) you selected for excellence 2) with a concrete job todo at hand 3) that depend for food and shelter on you/can deny at will. Even the electoral campaign is a mild foretaste only of the force of reaction<br>

**RADICAL TRANSPARENCY**.<br>
Just firing a bunch or shutting down agencies does not suffice. By the end of the term - half will be back, once you are gone - all will return, and with vengeance.
Go for **RADICAL TRANSPARENCY**. All us gov business **public by default**, and secret by request. All docs on public web and shared RO Gdrives. Flip the default state from the current - secret by default, made public by FOI/A request. This lever multiplies, can set in motion further change. Opens the field, opens opportunity for other random people you don't know and they themselves don't know of it as of now. For future them to join in, open source way, in permanent vigilance.
It's a gigantic task steering 1/4 of all US activity in a better direction. Many reformers have failed before you. Maybe 1/4 only by value, but it's much more by impact. Think of us gov as *libc*, as underlying library of shared common functions. The rest of US builds on top on it, and depends on it. Any gains, but also any f*ckups, will multiply and reverberate across the rest of the system. Gargantuan org is a beast, think in "will this change survive me facilitate enable further change by the guy after me". Easy template: build new in parallel, flip the switch over, retire old one. (something needs to keep ticking while you're building)

Cool - but TBF IDK if much is gained by the "mind virus" abstraction. Compared to a baseline -<br>
1) *Group* - group level emergent phenomena, both good "Wisdom of the crowds", and bad opposite c.f. @skdh "Collective Stupidity - How Can We Avoid It?" https://youtube.com/watch?v=25kqobiv4ng (on not/using independent errors trick to cancel out, but also much more)
2) *Individual* - "stupidity is a moral failing, not an intellectual one", and (connecting to the upper group level) "stupidity happens more in groups than in individuals, it's a sociological-psychological process that can infect many at the same time" in "Bonhoeffer‘s Theory of Stupidity" https://youtube.com/watch?v=ww47bR86wSc .
While I can foresee potential pitfalls -
3) Virus is external to the unit - but that's misleading. Our stupidity is embedded in us, we are never "clear" of it.
4) Virus spreads (bad), but then there are times where it does not spread (good). But it ain't so. Information flows between us - the units in the group - all the time. There is never a time when information is not exchanged between us the individual units (while we are alive).
5) Virus can be killed so we are free of it. But our stupidity can not be killed - only kept at bay.

Interesting, in a way—J. Sachs outsourced his thinking to the USG. Everything the USG told him, JS multiplied by +1. So merrily, merrily, he went on to administer Shock Therapy to Borat oiks. That turned out to be a mistake. JS's lesson learned was "Aw shucks, *damn* you, USG! From now on, I’ll multiply everything the USG says by -1." Where it should have been, "I distrust the USG and take no note of them."<br>
Further, JS seems to have decided to multiply everything the Russian government tells him by +1 this time around?? IDK how to comprehend that level of stupidity.
News for you, Mr. Savant: J. Sachs is still outsourcing his thinking to the USG—only now the correlation is -1, whereas previously it was +1. Independent thinking, my dude, is correlation 0. I can't believe a bona fide genius needs to be told this. Apparently, in every savant, a small idiot-savant lives inside too.

Afaik simulations use the polling data to sim with. And the french whale showed that public polls were systematically biased against Trump in 2024 (as were  previously in 2020 and 2016). Apparently "shy pollers" was not fixed. IDK what were the pollsters doing. But not all were cr*p at their jobs. As evidenced by the french whale commissioning his own polls, that were not systematically biased. If of any consolation - apparently Silver modal path at 20% was Trump winning the seven swings -<br>

😂 That image us never not funny. I call it the “like a dawg” photo. 😂 It's perfect! - serious Musk underling standing "at attention" next to the grinning Trump bossing it at his desk. 😂 I hope Musk has got enough stamina to take whatever Trump crazy comes his way. But - everyone has limits. Everyone in a team play takes some for the team. But also comes a point when one can't stand behind some action carried out in the name of the team. Pos the breakup will play out as: Trump cooks up some outlandish scheme, techbros are expected to endorse it without question. It's a loyalty test. The 1st-2nd-...Nth time they eat crow, kiss the king’s ring, say thank you. There will be (N+1)-th time when they refuse to play along, and then Trump throws them overboard. Crazy is a good test. It's not easily fakeable for the non-crazy. Plus in the process of faking it one goes a bit crazy too. (btw Trump can always out-crazy them)<br>

That's a fair piece. If you don't mind - can you maybe illuminate how and why @Keir_Starmer<br>
 is failing to even start solving the (admittedly) many problems of Leasehold? He's a lawyer, leading a gov of lawyers, knowing what needs doing (for years now), got votes of many on exactly these issues, with a huge and firm Westminster majority, groundwork done by the predecessors, pressure groups active and pushing for change... and yet and yet: early indications are he will fail miserably. I read .@RoryStewartUK 's book and have heard him and .@Dominic2306 on podcasts multiple times on the many problems of UK governance. Still - can not fathom, what can possibly stop a career politician versed in lawfare, executing on this ruthlessly. Is it character failings like corruption, cowardice, incompetence, laziness? Is it that the system is impenetrable in its determintation to do nothing, every movement stuck in deep heavy mud, with stasis at all levels? What and how, would dearly like to learn.

Yeah I agree it's not zero. But let us quantify, how much >0 is it worth to people? Revealed preferences often reveal that people are at most prepared to pay about the spend of a single cup of coffee, a month, for things they claim are important to them.<br>
Not only CC - happens for other things too. "Privacy" is similar. People claim "we want privacy", but revealed preference is they are not prepared to pay even £1 pcm for the thing they say they really really want.

That's  a good idea. Fwiw I use Lists for that and general thematic separation of traffic and TL shaping. Works well. Gripe: lists are not top level web interface, have to click on "... More" then go "Lists" so I frequently forget. Also - would be good to in/ex-clude posts depending on the category Post/Repost/Quote in addition to the user poster. Must say the Algofeed has improved a lot for me.  I used to use lists 95% of the time. Now it's reversed, only catch myself checking from time to time, maybe 5%.<br>
Related - List go well with Xpro decks. Surprised more is not made by X of that convenient list-deck duality. There is basic show List on this Deck but that's about it. Can implement "show only original posts but not re-posts" by turning the list into a query (which it is underlying it), but one loses the connection to the list and  the nice header that I kind of like. :-)

I think that national strategic reserves 1) are well-liked, 2) can be implemented effectively, and 3) actually help. I wonder what more can be done along the lines of the SPR? It seemed that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve was beneficial when it was needed and used.<br>
Price controls—they seem politically hard, and not sure how desirable they really are. They might do more good than harm in an initial pinch, but I suspect that calculus quickly reverses. Once politicians taste that power, it’s hard to imagine them not abusing it or easily giving it up latter. They are great a power.

Ofc - that's why it works better than anything else tried. Where people are not greedy/enough - we run into trouble. Can't make the individual do his/her bit for the group welfare. The group falls apart.<br>
People do things for other people for three reasons only – love, money, or force. Love doesn’t scale, so a large operation like the economy can only run on money or force. The force experiment was run multiple times (incl in my lifetime in my childhood), and found wanting every single time. What remains is TINA - money.

Yes true that - markets are not the only way to communicate prices of supply and demand (and do a distributed optimizaton, solve the problem of finding a clearing price). One could imagine e.g. surveys. But markets have additional desirable features:
1) Markets keep the participants honest. Market participants risk their $$$, have a skin in the game. By risking $$$ that they value, they are incentvised to be honest and try their best and utmost. In a way that say e.g. survey responders don't - they can be lazy and or dishonest, without significant penalties.
2) Markets not only do the price discovery, but the process is tied with the closing of the negative feedback loop too. So one gets both for the price of one, actually producing the lacking supply (or the less desirable - curbing the demand). The process is: supply lacking demand => $ price up => now opens an opportunity for a participant to earn $$$ we all crave => action to earn the $$$ => increased supply.
To the extent that the process can happen - it's desirable that we use markets where possible. Where the above (for whatever reasons) can't happen easily, there we are in trouble. As afaik we don't have an alternative well oiled political-economoic technology at hand. Wish we had something for those cases!

That's what they demand, as is their right. (even if the rest of us disagree) What's insane is - that the rest accept that. Rather than just replying back "NO". Bit of toddlerism indulgement there - not saying NO to unreasonable demands.<br>

You are right - but you are late, if you don't mind me saying. Quant trading is about converting better information into better forecasts into bets into $$$. It's been going on for donkey years. Admit - there isn't much good public info. Those in the know rarely talk, those that talk don't know. I've been told a story from a then DEShaw analyst who worked abt the same time as Bezos. That Bezos pitched the Amazon idea to David, and David refused, as he didn't want to do anything with atoms, but stay in the world of information for $$$.<br>

Yes, it’s true—markets aren’t the only way to communicate supply and demand or find a clearing price. For example, one could imagine using surveys. But markets have additional desirable features (in addition to performing distributed optimization to find a clearing price):<br>
1. **Markets keep participants honest.** Market participants risk their own money, meaning they have skin in the game. By risking something they value, they’re incentivized to be honest and put in their best effort, unlike, say, survey responders, who can be lazy or dishonest without facing significant consequences.
2. **Markets close the feedback loop.** Markets don’t just discover prices; they also drive corrective actions through a negative feedback loop, aligning individual incentives with broader supply and demand needs. When demand exceeds supply, prices rise. This increase signals an opportunity to earn money—something we all value. Participants, driven by the potential for profit, are naturally motivated to step in and increase supply. It’s a mechanism where individual actions, motivated by self-interest, benefit the larger system by helping stabilize prices and balance supply and demand.
To the extent that it’s possible, using markets is desirable. But in situations where this process can’t function effectively, we’re left without a well-developed alternative. Unfortunately, I don’t think we have any other political-economic technology as reliable for these cases. I only wish we did!

If I wanted to live in the culture of my home country, I would have stayed there. I came to the UK by chance, and the more I stayed, the more I grew to appreciate its culture. Eventually, I chose to make my home here because I learned to love the unique qualities of this place. The last thing I’d want is for UK culture to change and resemble that of my home country.<br>
We need a multitude of cultures, not only to cooperate but also to compete. Different cultures excel in different areas, each running its own ‘cultural experiments.’ This variety allows us to observe what works and what doesn’t, and to learn from each other. A single, monolithic world culture would be, in my view, undesirable.
Yes, there are frictions between cultures due to differences, but that’s a price worth paying. Positive change often emerges from these differences, as distinct cultures try new approaches and learn through practical experience. While no culture should remain frozen in time—everyone must adapt to the evolving world—we do need a diversity of cultures to retain their distinct identities.

Yeah — it’s a bit like Indiana Jones' 'Leap of Faith' in search of the Holy Grail. We don’t know what the future holds. While the definition of AGI might be 'everything a human does,' I’m skeptical that *everything* a human can do will be achieved all at once. It’s more likely that progress will come in parts — some sooner, others later. Still, my belief is, admittedly, an article of faith, based on nothing more than induction and history. Faith, after all, means making a leap beyond evidence; it involves embracing what can’t be proven and often defies logical reasoning.<br>

I'm saying - 60-80% will be replaced, like the agriculture jobs were replaced. Only - new jobs will spring up, if we are being blindly optimistic there. Jobs that we can't fathom what they will be. The same way my jobs didn't exists for my parents' generation. For the longest of times I could not explain to my mum what I do for a living.

Yeah, those jobs may disappear, but I hope new ones will spring up. When I was growing up, my jobs didn't exist: automatic speech recognition engineer, on smartphones (no such thing), quant researcher trader (nope). At some point 60-80% of the population worked the land, were in agriculture jobs - but now that's 3-5% only. Yes it possibly sucked for the agri- laborer to up sticks and go to a big city, to work in a factory. Looking at China where the same has been happening in our lifetimes - the latter seems preferred to the  former by the laborer/worker themselves. Yes the laid off workers from Detroit may not re-qualify as programmers, but their kids may move to California and find jobs in Tech. All change sucks for someone. That's not a reason against. I'm grateful to my predecessors that moved to the city. For one - people now days don't have to have 4-6 kids only to have 2-4 die in childhood. That alone is worth it all.<br>

**American elections came and went, and... no AI disasters?**
*With AI – we can’t help but scare ourselves senseless! In my lifetime:*
1) **Growing up learning about AI and ML.** All along, it was the Turing Test! Who knew what would happen once we passed that milestone? (Perhaps a chasm in space-time would open!)
**Reality:** Turing Test passed, sometime recently (?? when exactly? we don't know) – nothing happens. No one notices. It's a nothing burger. No reflection on what we expected versus what actually happened.
2) **Generative AI.** Deep fakes! Fake pics, fake videos! People will definitely believe every random fake they see or hear—especially in politics and elections. Quick! We need regulation! Ban open-source weights, regulate linear algebra, license GPUs like typewriters of old, and cap processing power at 10^21 FLOPS to avoid danger! 😱
**Reality:** American election campaigns come and go, and... nothing. No fakes, no crisis. Another nothing burger. Everyone forgets the fears they were losing sleep over two weeks prior.
**Future forecast:**
3) **AGI.** We have agents as reasonable as an average human. Pre-launch chatter: The end of the world is near! Who knows what will happen! Aaaargh!
**Forecast:** "Agent X, I'm going to Spain April 3-11. Please book flights from Y to Z, morning outbound, evening return if possible. Book accommodations—three days here, four days there, etc."
It replaces me spending time on travel sites (Google Flights, Airbnb, Booking, car rentals, etc.) and saves my Saturday morning. Like web booking replaced pen, paper, and phone, shortening a full weekend chore to a mere morning one. Another nothing burger, becomes reality within 6-12 months. No one looks back at the earlier catastrophizing.
4) **ASI.** An intelligent assistant sees patterns in my data, suggesting transformations, bucketings, or conditionings that would take me weeks to test on my own. Uh-oh, the computer may replace me.
**Forecast:** The agent writes code following on the suggestions, launches 10K jobs on a remote cluster, babysits restarts, collects results, and asks for input when needed. No one blinks. No one thinks I should be wrestling with Slurm or Condor or Gcompute, fixing random errors, or deleting files to restart from the right place. Haha – of course, it would be insane to use a costly human for low-level stuff like that. AGI the great replacement theory? Postponed, until the next scare!

+1 to that. For the life of me can't comprehend how having someone else drill/produce the gas us in the UK use helps anything. Could understand if we decided "we are not using gas anymore". Or "we will use and produce it ourselves". But to continue its use, while simultaneously discouraging or banning its production - that makes no sense to me.<br>

In the UK asking build-build-build of the governments is  as good as asking them to play ballet. The commanding heights of the UK political economy are monopolized by lawyers (that sometimes take -poor- advice from bad economists). Lawyers think executing on something is talking and arguing about it. Can't imagine they have built anything ever in their lives. So asking building and doing of them is futile. They can't do it - even if they wanted.<br>
UK will have to wait for a post-Keir gov at minimum. But even then - nothing is on the horizon. Farage and REF are incompetent buffoons. They'd need a Musk character by the side to build anything. And this still  in a best case scenario where Trump does not dispose of the techbro wing shortly after getting in power. It's always easier to provide circus distractions and bread to the population, than shoot for the stars.

I hear you, but - to govern is to choose. At some point a fork in the road appears, where it's either A) use the builders and the machinery to build homes for our kids; or B) use  the builders and machinery to build a tunnel for the bats. At some point it's either A or B; can't be both. At some point one has to prefer one over the other. It's impossible to do everything, all the time. To think it is, is to delude ourselves and lie to ourselves.<br>

Massive increase in Fed debt is massive increase in private wealth. It matters if IR =5% as the payment eats in the budget, but much less if IR=0.5%.
Two state - probably not, IDK that much about middle east.
Ukraine - possibly. Trump may discover that Russia is hell bent on conquering it all, dismantling the state, killing off the language and nationhood, absorbing the territory and 40M people as Novo- or Malo- Russia. Then after Lukasenka dies, same with Bello- Russia. All three combining into a Greater Russia. Then possibly continuing onto next target in East or Central Europe. And that may turn out to be too much even for Trump.

> high inflation would inflate their debts away
It only happens via the mechanics of getting a pay rise at least the size of inflation + Interest rate. And that is just to keep still - not to get ahead. As they are squeezed by inflation from below and by the IR tax from above. So the pay rise would need to be very substantial.
Japan deflation - IDK what measure and what period you mean. In the last 12 months on http://tradingeconomics.com the inflation-cpi measure (rolling 12mo) for united-states and japan are broadly similar.

Musk/techbros will likely be tossed overboard (or worse) within 6–12 months. Think it will play out as: Trump’s crazy cooks up some outlandish scheme, they are expected to endorse it without question—a loyalty test. The 1st time they eat crow, kiss the king’s ring, and say thank you. Musk’s infamous “like a dawg” photo, standing "at attention" next to Trump who's sitting at his desk, captures this dynamic. The 2nd time they refuse to play along and Trump casts them aside.

"Chomsky managed to convince his followers that language wasn't learned. Looking back, it's a completely crazy thing to say. If you can convince people to say something as obviously false, then you've got them in your cult". 😂
You (and Hinton) concede too much to Chom. He had one good idea (Manufacturing consent, 2nd author there), and even that is passing in relevance now with MSM losing to SocMed. Some of his ideas were wrong, others ("every American enemy is a good guy") were both bonkers and evil.
On language it was apparent from some time ago

Turns out many non-STEM-s have trouble with logic and epistemology?? Who knew! I thought STEM-s were supposed to be ignorant of philosophy and that jazz.
(aside: I also see that "I had statisticians tell me a big model has a 100 parameters. The idea of learning a million parameters is just stupid. Well - we're doing a trillion now" immediately follows; got the 2nd of the "two cultures" holy cows slayed there too, a true pay-one-get-two by H, surpassed himself there!)

Yes, true that, altruism is not exclusive to geeks. Charities, doctors in Médecins Sans Frontières, various surgery charities—remember from Do No Harm by Henry Marsh—there are lots of altruistic people around.<br>

Normies can't understand don't understand even a 1960-s procedural language. The idea that they will run a small computer in their brain, and will execute the program in their mind eye, as they are writing it, word for word, line by line - they find impossible.<br>
Some number of students in my class could never get past the redirection of C pointers. It's possible that some small cog in the brain is missing, or not functioning well enough, to enable that kind of crucial mind jump technology.
Another thing with the geeks is not only are they mildly autistic, they are disproportionally altruistic. Most of the home computers, then PC-s, then early Internet and connectivity, then the content of the early html online worlds, was built for the love of things, without regard or expecting any monetary return. Free Software of the GNU type makes zero sense to normies.

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
Thanks - that's kind. Yes I think this footer is kind of pre-emptive "request for secrecy", in this case to guard against possible "FOIA". IDK much abt US law, but "FOIA" sounds to me like "FOI" Act here in the UK (where I live).<br>
In the UK some gov secrets citizens can get to, via FOI "Freedom Of Information" request. One has to know exactly what to ask for (and follow a process - but that's fine). Knowing what to ask for is a big hurdle. For most things, we citizens are so much in the dark, that we don't even know what to ask for. (also there are enough exemptions that allow the gov to hide a lot)
I don't have a good ready solution of how "request for secrecy" can be judged reasonably, as not to descend into "secrecy by default", by gov simply asking for secrecy for everything, and that being rubber stamped and approved.
TBH EM is the only person of any influence I've ever heard to ask for "radical transparency". Any realistic move in that direction is so unlikely, that I've not put much thought into practicalities of it. Most people are pro-privacy, pro-secrecy. Ages ago I read abt the idea in Weigend's "Data for the People". I've come to agree with @aweigend . I think the more developed the society, the more coordination it needs, the more information sharing it needs. That can only happen with trust. And atm it's hard to be trusting, when gov-everything is secret towards me, while my entire life is open towards them. The power imbalance is too large for comfort. Most think balance can be restored by making our private lives more secret than now. I think that's neither possible (for a number of reasons, incl revealed prefs that pple rarely are willing to pay even a small price for it), nor desirable. But making the gov life as public to us private citizens, as ours are for the gov - that's both possible and desirable.
Aside. Can't help but notice that all of AI is powered by altruistic people making oodles of information public and open for all to use. Also early Internet was very trusting, and everything was very open. Initially (e.g. telnet) there was not an encryption even.

Yeah, agreed there are downsides too. It's "by default" only though - so it'd still be possible to keep secrets, only "by request": one would have to request it to be secret. Rather than it being secret "by default". In that example - it's possible that every doc they communicate has that footer as default, whether trully warranted or not. With the technical means available with everything being electronic, it shouldn't be too hard to execute the "secrecy by request".<br>

I suspect weight wise you are right it's insignificant. It maybe more consequential for the plane turn-around time. Every second spent on the tarmac is a loss to the airline. It's difficult to happen b/c it requires cooperation and coordination by 3 (optionally 4/5) parties - airports doing the loading, airlines, passengers, and optionally luggage/plane manufacturers. Can't see that level of cooperation happening. Once I read an article on how unlikely ship containerization was to happen, even if everyone knew it'd be better and cheaper way to transport for a long time. Simply b/c it required cooperation and coordination from multiple parties.<br>

Possible that not only does sex crate humans, but that sexuality created humanity. Seek an obscure '90s book The Erect Woman (orig The Planet of Women) arguing that sexuality, and in particular women's control of sexual attraction, is the key factor in human evolution. That sexual dynamics is more influential than labor, tools, opposing thumbs, brain size, fire etc. Possible that the author has joined the ranks of the cranks since. Unfortunate - but doesn't make his then arguments nil.<br>

I think some flexibility on the airlines side offering larger containers created by joining smaller or standard ones together. And on the other side charging people more for anything non-standard, as an the unavoidable evil. Think that will shake that aspect the transport industry out of a rut it seems stuck on. It seems nothing much has changed there recently. In comparison - airplanes, airports have improved a lot, even compared to 10 years ago. On the passenger side bags with 4 rollers of 360 degrees took a decade to arrive. After decades to get 2 wheels on the bags.<br>

Kids are the best thing that happened to me, ever. Had I known how much joy and fun they are growing - would have made more effort to have kids earlier & more. Watching a child grow up from nothing to a human day in/out is one of the most rewarding and awe inspiring sights. Nothing else in nature comes close tbh! The vastness of the night sky with the stars twinkling or a powerful waterfall maybe impressive, AI may amaze us - but: they look small when compared to e.g. a child learning language and starting to talk and converse. Out of seemingly nothing - everything! Whatever self-organization self-learning or developmental programs unfold - they are an awesome to behold at every stage.<br>

Rather than "secrecy by default" and things made public only 1) at gov will 2) at FoI request (often frustrated by the bureaucracy in execution), we dearly need radical transparency: everything public, on the public web, on the public shared cloud drives (read only), as default. Closed off and made secret only by request. Admit there are pros- and cons- to both public and secret, to knowing and not-knowing, but imo we have reached a point where "public by default" offers better trade offs. Agree that such change has close to zero chance of happening. Hell will freeze over sooner that Yes Minister Sir Humphreys' running the UK change their ways this way. Still - radical transparency is the right call for the information age.

Flipping the sign and assuming the opposite of what MSM says doesn’t get us to the truth either. Blindly believing the inverse of every statement is as flawed as accepting everything at face value. Skepticism means a correlation of zero, not negative one. This is basic reasoning! Your approach shows that even savants have their idiot-savant side.<br>
Where’s the open-source X Algofeed? Where are the thousands of user-driven Algofeeds blooming? What happened to RealPerson authentication for those who want it? Why hasn’t LLM processing been applied to analyze 1B daily posts, allowing Algofeeds to move beyond metadata (timeliness, interactions) alone? Current maximal engagement is having one half of X users at the throats of the other half. Is that the future that will make humans multi planetary??

Central and Eastern Europeans, take heed. This address misses the mark for half its intended audience. W/EU won’t “grow up” as implied; they’re already playing their calculated game. Their strategy? "We choose to be helpless. The U.S. wields influence, but in exchange, we gain protection while minimizing defense spending." They know they don’t have to outrun the Bear—just CE/EU. And the Bear comes for you first.<br>
Don’t expect salvation from the U.S. center-woke elite of Sullivan-Charap types under a potential Harris administration. Their lives of “infinite samosas” won’t be upended for what they see as a backwater struggle of un-woke Borat oiks. You’ll get more than nothing, but not by much. And if the right-woke trumpian insurgents win, with the Sacks-Musk techbros already cozying up to Kremlin oligarchic interests—you can bet on much worse.
For CE/EU, the stakes are existential. To ensure survival, you must match the Bear’s threat: an independent nuclear deterrent. One nuclear power attacking might be happenstance; two, a coincidence. You don’t wait for a third to confirm enemy action.
With a population of 120 million, and economies never richer, you’ve never been in a better position to act. Band together or be devoured. If Marie Curie could defy the odds under far harsher conditions, so can you.

Heh - a good example, even if IDK anything abt or of Borjas so TL;DR. I now notice center-woke in addition to (now ancient) left-woke and (more recent) right-woke. Yeah it's prone to fall for "I'm not ideological" fallacy and not reflect on, and examine, it's own ideology.<br>
In a sense it's 4) "unknown knowns" - my own ideology. Like - fish can't perceive water. The final quadrant of the quartet. Others quadrants being:
1) "known knowns" - deterministic knowledge, I know exactly which one;
2) "known unknowns" - probabilistic knowledge, I don't know which ones exactly, but I know the counts per type, I know the p.d.f, so I know the distribution of outcomes (risk people call it Aleatoric uncertainty);
3) "unknown unknowns" - I don't know the distribution, I can't enumerate all possibilities, anything goes (risk people call it Epistemic uncertainty).

Haha - excellent! 😆 Indeed, Saint Greta is the poster child of the centrist-woke. First, we had the left-woke blazing the trail, but now it’s past its peak and fading in the distance (group identity, wishing away nature, degrowth). The reaction brewed for some time, and recently, the right-woke broke out into the open—think RFK Jr.’s anti-vax and anti-reason stances, EM’s exciting “Hitler wasn’t all bad” alt-history, and Trumpist “flood the field with sh*t” tactics. What started as Alex Jones’ flights of fancy is now in full swing.<br>
But of course, as you point out, there’s centrist-woke too! The health-beauty-organic-green nonsense, modern-day snake oil. Besotted by beauty, shallow, falling head over heels for hollow, aesthetic ideals. Insane about net-zero and nuclear, stuck in boomer-era ideology—I hope it fades away sooner rather than later. FT Ganesh touched on this recently but didn’t press the point to its logical whole. (ref https://x.com/ljupc0/status/1843567980208083027)
Glad I read your post. The centrist-woke really completes the field. All these movements arose from genuine attempts to address real grievances and unmet needs. And yes, it’s easier to poke holes and jab at doers than to take action and change reality. Still, having a good map of the terrain is invaluable before setting out on a journey.

W/EU will never do it. For them the costs-benefits calculus of "we are willingly helpless, US wields influence over us, but in return US protects us, so we spend little on defense" works that way. B/c W/EU know they don't have to outrun The Bear.  The Bear has CE/EU on its path first to gobble up.<br>
The same calculus tilts the other way for CE/EU! For yourselves, The Bear is an existential threat. The only way for you to stay alive is to level the field and become and existential threat to The Bear in return. You must acquire your own independent nuclear deterrent yourself.
Over the objections of W/EU and probable hostility of Germany and US. Nordics don't have to, but being smart will probably help you in various ways. Finland may even join the effort. The Balts are willing and capable, they will join you. The Czechs are capable and probably willing. Slovaks - probably best ignore. Romanians should be self-interested, are capable, and should join - but probably will not.
Regardless - you must do it, even if you do it solo. It's that - or death. If Marie could defy odds in much direr circumstances, you'd fail Poland if you don't do it in much better circumstance now.

Nice 🙂 that it conveniently maps to current reasoning systems. Intuition in alpha go is what generates the hypothetical moves that are strung into lattices. Logic is when the paths are assessed, judged, most torn down as bad. (one or few that survive are acted on)<br>

That was a joy to listen and watch. Thanks for that.<br>
On the naming: isn't a "lattice" a generally accepted name for a DAG or a forward evolving tree where there is merging in addition to branching? I worked on generating lattices from speech (for speech recognition, annotation and searching) ages ago, and remember "lattice" as the term used for the structure you (possibly) describe. If I understood the structure correctly that is - hearing of this for the 1st time only today. ☺️

😆😆 Hehe - very good. That one is doubly amusing. 😂 The second layer is that Trump will indeed f*ck Musk, in addition to Twitter (and everything else in his path). Not many escape unmolested. The cleverer ones learn to stay away (Scaramuchi?). Poor dumb f*cks like Gulliani come back for more until ruined. (IDK how anyone can fail as much as quick)<br>
Saw the pic below just this evening - perfect! 😂😂 (if true - didn't check)
Hope Trump doesn't win, so Musk is spared further distraction (and humiliation - but that's less important), and continues to spend his time and energy on worthy endevours. Musk is a savant. But there's an idiot-savant side too in him, as is in many savants. His worst blind spots are domains where reaility is not only opposite, but a mirror image of a domain he knows well, is good in, and obv loves. Unfortunately our cosmos is imperfect.
(also Musk backed a loser in a prior elect cycle - no? not very politically savy, but as expected for a CA techie)

There is something in the water. Ideas - good and bad (but we only learn which is which post fest) - that everyone else sensibly dismisses with "pass! that's crazy, it's never going to work" find a niche group of fervent believers that is still large enough, and commited enough, to expend large enough effort to make a decent go at making the idea reaility. Call it optimistic, gullible, crazy - but seems necessary for an idea to be put to a non-trivial test. This observing from far far away having never been to California.<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
You are right to be confused. Only one who's not thought abt this is not confused.<br>
My best explanation: it's a matter of degree, and it's about the politics of the losers of these policies in the deficit country. The winners outweigh the losers initially with liberalised trade post obstacles to free trade removal. Things work as intended and to net benefit. All is good
However, positive feedback loops are ubiquitous in human groups. Big becomes bigger, small becomes smaller. Things that work will be done, and then they will be overdone. There's no infinite capacity to absorbing deficits. Yes you as consumer benefit from cheap TVs. But as a worker earning wages in a TV factory that's shuts down, you will suffer will lose your job and income and your consumption will collapse too. And in the economy it's a truism that everything produced must be consumed, or it will not be produced in the next round. So the growth slows down, then stops, then ultimately reverses and we get a decline, a reduction in stuff made and consumed. You are now very unhappy and that will show at the ballot box.
Now we know when there are technological shifts people adapt. 90% of the population was in the agriculture, but now it's only 3%. But it takes time for that to work itself through the system. And it's generational. It's not the Detroit car workers that learned software development. They can't do that, no one can. It's their children that move to California and join Tech industry.
Now free trade does enrich the parties. And I suspect we have no better developmental model we know of than industrialisation + exports. Asia is a huge success story. And the US contribution to jumpstarting that by running trade deficits is huge and under praised. If only Africa had a similar benefector in the 20th century. Still - the machine that works can be overworked.

True that - but social media Algofeeds don't cover themselves in glory either. I thought Musk could see the huge opportunity there for improved SNR when he bought X. Thought he'd do content processing of the 1B posts daily, even to a single 128 or 256 feature vector (with then DNNs), and shift away from using solely meta-data (timeliness, interactions with) in the Algofeed automated posts editor. He pooped the coop on that one. (and many other things X - RealIdentity for pple that want it, open sourcing everything, offering choice of 1000 Algofeeds instead of letting only 2 bloom, etc)<br>

NF is like the more talented tricksters, that after fleecing their marks, come back to the victim for another round. They come back with a good story, along the lines of (paraphrased - I lack that talent) "I am sorry I run into trouble, and your £££ is lost, for reasons x y z, but that was a misfortune, or a foul play on someone else's part, not my fault, I wanted the best for you, and I suffered too; now I only need you to extend £500 to help me help you, and we will get your £5000 back". They know full well that a gullible person is gullible for life. The marks can be milked multiple times. Just need a good story for "one more time" roll of the fortunes.<br>

People making media are pretty dumb and not super educated themselves. They were under ever growing pressures of their business models too. So no time for niceties luxuries like quality. They assumed everyone is like them too, pretty dumb - and for a very long time, they were not that wrong! But the Internet long tail harvesting allowed for shows that don't cater to the lowest common denominator to survive. New business models survived. Hope old MSM either dies or changes shape joints the winning team sooner. But I fear MSM will limp along as long as Boomers are around, and its significance will track the Boomers' share of population.<br>

Betting is the most honest opinion voicing. Putting your money where your mouth is golden. 😁 However - it's not perfect, it can be gamed, all public markets are gameable. Whole industries have sprung around that. E.g. public orderbooks are laughably volnurable, even mostly closed auctions, dark pools too. It's amazing how information can be cajoled teased to leak, and how little information about the future needs to leak for perfectly unforecastable proces to become monetizable. Human inginuity, and esp when allowed to prod and probe the process and not merely passively watch, is a force to reckon with.<br>

We’re in far greater danger than we realize—not only because this guy is being played like a fiddle by adversaries who can easily predict his every move (thanks to Sullivan's incessant telegraphing), staying two steps ahead without breaking a sweat.<br>
Not only because there are probably a hundred people around him who could pull him aside and say, “When the world seems a mystery and you can't understand why things are happening, you’re the sucker at the table—the mark.” (Putin’s actions may be an enigma to Sullivan, but they’re clear enough to Putin.)
Not only because the system produced *this* as a peak of achievement—a man who’s had the President’s ear for years on every critical topic. His allies have won the policy battles so far, and the same policies will likely continue.
But most dangerously, their adversaries can’t actually believe anyone could be this foolish. They keep looking for the hidden angle, the 8-dimensional chess move, unable to predict the moves of genuinely clueless people. That’s the lethal risk of stupidity.
Sullivan and his ilk may ultimately lead us toward the very catastrophe they seek to avoid—a disaster that won’t stop at their borders (or ours).

Not quite in o1-preview. One is given feedback as to the stages the reasoning engine is going through ("doing X", "doing Y", ...), but one never gets to learn what the complete set of guard rails or constraints the reasoning machine is constrained by.<br>
TBH don't expect that to ever be revealed by OpenAI or anyone else, unless it's open sourced completely. And even then, knowing everything and being able to run at will - it's not obvious what influences what. B/c it'd be like 1 Million parameters, each contributing 1/1M -th to the final answer. Exactly like us humans! 😇 We do something, and we don't know why exactly. (we can and do post-rationalize though)

... but wait, there is more. You are seeing the technical side. On the power-balance side, the gain to the top is ever bigger! Now that the rules are so erroneous that it's impossible to comply - everyone is potentially in breach of them. Everyone potentially a criminal is even better than some people knowing they are breaching the rules, and others knowing for sure they are not, that they are in the clear. As now the potential crime hangs like the Damocles Sword over the head of every person of the land, from the lowest to the highest.<br>
Now the secret enforcer (think NKVD) of the land can arbitrarily but plausibly accuse anyone and everyone, at will, at random. The randomness paralyzes everyone with fear. The sword can come down at any moment, on a random number generator, no rime nor reason needed. This drives people insane. And this is everyone - no escapes, there are no exceptions.
Then the supreme ruler (think Stalin) gets the option to remove easily and quietly (and with a plausible reason too) any one person in the land, by a stroke of a pen. Think - just initial the list of the condemned before dinner, and the secret police will have them shto by the morning. No person - no problem.
US may need to re-occupy and save EU from itself for the 3rd time in ~100yrs? In EU defense - one needs to be educated for this level of insanity. On its own, uneducated are unlikely to come up with a fiendishly devious scheme like this. Holocaust was invented in the land without illiterate people.

About half the population heads are screwed not quite right somehow. And on the extreme end of that are folks living in an upside-down Stranger Things world, a mirror image of ours. They act on urges that they have trouble even rationalising to themselves after the fact! Humans' is a collective intelligence. Had it been less collective, these units would have removed themselves from the gene pool long ago. I suspect their craziness adds some randomness so to allow extra variation needed to find rare unlikely adaptations in spaces where no gradient search would ever lead us to. I haven't got a better explanation to the phenomenon. Usually we are not exposed to the full spectrum of human variation at school or work. Previously one could become cognisant of that only say doing a national service. Now we have almost everyone online so we get a sample of the extreme tails of distributions.<br>

Thanks! Love the catchy phrase beta-hat v.s. y-hat. 😆 It does succinctly describe and makes it obvious what's going on. We have no reason to think we know what the model is that's generating the data, even less so to think it's a linear model (with a beta). So to worry about how well our beta-hat approximates the beta of the wrong model - is just not a very fruitful activity. Or it can be said that it's fruitful to the degree that the model is a linear one for real.<br>

That's all true, but: Musk and the tech bros will be tossed overboard Bannon-style (or worse) within 6–9 months. Here’s why: the moment Trump’s crazy brain cooks up an outlandish scheme, they’ll be expected to endorse it without question—a loyalty test.<br>
The first time it happens, they’ll eat crow, kiss the king’s ring, and say thank you. Musk’s infamous “like a dog” photo next to Trump at his desk captures this dynamic perfectly. But the second time? They’ll likely refuse to play along, and Trump will move to cast them aside.
If Musk and the tech bros were running for office themselves, it would be a different story. But Trump has his sights set on building a dynasty, starting with Ivanka and the heirs, with Jared as the enabler behind the throne.

The capacity of VSPs to ruin themselves and drag us all down is unmatched! I'm afraid you’re underestimating the Very Stupid People (VSPs). With COVID, you had a trial run and a prime position to observe it live—no?<br>
Pre-COVID, MMT argues 1) The U.S. government can't willingly run out of money, as it always creates it; but BUT—2) the big danger is INFLATION. VSPs and economists respond, “Haha, that’s insane.”
Then COVID comes along. Step 1) The U.S. government does indeed NOT run out of money; and then Step 2) we indeed get INFLATION. The same VSP economists as before, “Haha, MMT disproved!”
I salute your persistence and sanguinity. I don’t know how you stay sane, rather than take the Semmelweis exit.

Thanks - but I'll give it a miss. There is bazillion of stuff to be read, seen, heard, online - and only one lifetime. For greenies like her, when push comes to shove, and her compatriots fail to share her enthusiasm for offing themselves (committing suicide), next step is repression and murder Pol Pot style. Path well traveled. Good people do good by default, bad people do bad by default. It takes religion or ideology to achieve level of indoctrination where good people will do bad things. For a higher purpose of course, nothing personal there. They will be just discharging responsibility assigned to them by quirk of history. Executing unwillingly - not that they would seek power for themselves. Like Stalin and the rest of the monsters of history - all very modest souls. For once one self-convinces that 8B will die, then anything goes. Killing 4B to save 4B - "fine". Even killing 8B-1 to save that 1 - "better than the alternative". Not only better - but a moral imperative to boot! Hope she does not attain power. But that's where my interest in German Greens (GG) ends. Sorry to disappoint.<br>

My personal prejudice is on the CO2 trajectory. Will be both worse and better. Given what we observed with the ~1.2C rise in ~100yrs - 1) we will overshoot 3C, that will be worse than forecast, 2) the impact will be net positive, positives outweighing negatives in total. Again just looking back at what happened during the past 100yrs and 1.2C rise. Afaics humanity is in rude health. Most humans ever alive in history, most food ever produced, least number hungry destitute etc. Mother Earth seems to be doing mostly ok whenever I look at   @OurWorldInData charts. Yes parts of India, Iran, SA etc may become too hot to be habitable by humans, UK may become too cold if the Golf stream is disrupted. . Humans will move.<br>

I understand why and how people say "communism", but the socialism (communism) of my childhood was somewhat different. They forever tried for growth and improvement of living standards, but repeatedly failed to achieve that. So they delivered similar results to the crazy-greenie quoted, but not for the lack of trying. A typical cycle went 1. the system is not working, it's failing 2. let's change this thing 3. the change proposed looks like capitalism 4. stop - abandon change. Then in abt 10th yr anniversary of step 1, a new cycle of the sequence wd commence. Only this time the crisis was even more dire. (I'm aware of 3 such 10yr cycles in ex-YU). Changes needed required the party to relinquish power. Between bad present where they had 100% power, and possibly better future where they'd wield less than 100%, sufficient numbers in the ruling party always preferred the former.

Is the Random Forests guy also the guy that wrote https://www2.math.uu.se/~thulin/mm/breiman.pdf<br>
? I'm not a statistician. I was taught statistics badly, so got to dislike it, even if I loved everything mathematics at school, and computers and all things computing latter. For the longest time I could not understand most things stats, in the "but why??? why would you want that?!" way. In a sense - "understand the words, but not understanding the sentences", what was being said didn't make sense to me. Then at some point I read the paper above and many things made sense. Wish I'd read it decades prior! I still didn't like stats, but I could understand why. ☺️  Heard @geoffreyhinton in an interview say "statisticians told me to learn more than 100 parameters is crazy, just crazy" 😂 - but can't find the clip now, sorry.

Ha! That was an unexpected and delightful find!<br>
"Otkrivanje Amerike, Voja Antonić" by @PCPressRS . Good to hear a childhood idol. (@vojaantonic ?) Found out he upped sticks and moved to California at most excellent age of 65yo. 😆 And by the sound of it, seems he's found his tribe, the tribe he belongs to. 🥰 Life lessons etc - yay! ☺️ kudos 🫡

Rather than "secrecy by default" and "things made public only 1) at gov will 2) at FoI request" (latter usually counter-frustrated by the state, in execution), we dearly need radical transparency: everything public, on the public web, on public shared Google drives (read only), as default. Closed off and made secret only by request. Admit there are pros- and cons- to both public and secret, to knowing and not-knowing, but imo we have reached a point where "public by default" offers better trade offs. Agree that such change has about zero chance of happening. 😇 Hell will freeze over sooner that Yes Minister Sir Humphreys' running the UK forever change their ways this way. 😂<br>

Is it possible that the 1) gov owned assets - council homes - in the old times. So the responsibility that 2) "local council is obliged to house ones that can't house themselves" 3) was discharged that way. And now that gov has 4) disposed of those assets, and 5) not built new housing to replace the old one, while keeping the obligation to house people (#2), has to 6) house them in the private sector, and has to 7) pay £££ as everyone else? So a number of things 1-7 conspire to the result seen on the graph.<br>

To "look objectively" is a contradiction in terms afaics It's impossible "look objectively". Any and all "looking" happens in the eye and the mind of the observer. So "looking" can not be the objective reality, as reality exists outside of the observer. The observer can only ever have views of that reality. So they will always be subjective.<br>
Imagine the reality is a 3D object, forever unknowable without non-zero error, never completely accessible to us mortals. We always get a mere 2D view of that object. We can say - the view we know, the object we don't know. Say the 3D object is a cylinder. We may get many 2D views, a circle, a rectangle, and many other 2D shapes too. All those will be subjective views. The only objective thing is a non-2D-view it's the 3D object. The object and any views are forever different qualities.

Agreed with all above. Plus - it's a reversion to the mean. Although it may undershoot, i.e. overshoot on the downside. Because - the current baby bust comes after a huge baby boom!! The number of humans alive is ATH. For a very long time, humanity had a steady state: for every 5-6 newborn, 3-4 died before they could have kids of their own. So the population was about constant. Then with the improved living standards post industrial revolution, the 3-4 stopped dying. The 5-6 were still born though - so we got a population boom for a generation-two. Now culture is catching up with the biology.<br>
Personal anecdote: my grandparents on both sides born in the Ottoman empire, end-19c/beg-20c, all had >=6 kids. Their grand/grand/...parents broods of similar sizes all had kids die before their adulthoods. But my grandparents kids (my parents) lived to adulthood and had kids of their own (my generation). My parents siblings were 5-6, but my parents generation had only 2-3 kids themselves. The reason my parents generation lived is the industrial revolution. Plus - living in an apartment in a city with 1 bedroom per kid puts a limit in way. The extended families moved from the villages to the cities post WW2. The country experienced industrial revolution after 1945. My generation (1968) also has ~2 kids. We were in a position similar to our parents.
It's remarkable that humans do that (many other species don't): during best of times, humans stop multiplying. It will be a decade-two until this becomes consequential - possibly. B/c by then maybe AI will be multiplying humans' intellectual capabilities so we may still be ok wrt research & development.

I'm not saying they shd be, but a working solution wd be: 1) a public register of assets 2) a "charge" on the asset in the register 3) upon conversion of the asset in cash (sale), the "charge" that's the tax obligation is paid with fraction of the cash i.e. is "discharged". Can be optional - the asset owner can have the tax handled that way, or settled in cash (based on some valuation). Or a combination: the tax obligation starts as a charge on the asset put in the register tied to the asset, then it can be discharged at any point via cash payment (valued at real-time valuation), up to and including the point of asset disposal. We already have a working system like this for an asset - houses bought with mortgage. There's a register, the interest of the mortgage lender in the house is registered as a "charge". When I the mortgage holder sell the house, the mortgage lender will receive his cash. Or I may pay the mortgage early (terms of the mortgage conditional on). In both cases - the charge is discharged and removed. I can imagine a scheme where the charge stays even after the asset changes ownership. But that seems an  unnecessary complication.

Thanks, no worries - public is fine. The "positives will outweigh the negatives" expectation is indeed based on survivorship bias! You identified that correctly. We have had 1.2C rise in 100yrs already. Afaics humanity is in good health - the most humans ever in history alive, the most food ever produced, the least number hungry or destitute or similar. CO2 is food for the plants so that maybe helpful. The natural world seems to be doing ok too, when I look the charts on the environment on @OurWorldInData . Yes some parts of India, Iran, Saudi Arabia etc may become too hot to be comfortably habitable. People will move. UK may become too cold if the Golf stream warmth is disrupted. Many may choose to move (myself included), in preference to living with cold winters like in Canada or Norway. We know in pre-history (before humans lived) there are many episodes with CO2 being higher than the more extreme forecasts. Life on earth was abundant too. For us humans I think bigger threats are - destruction of our civilization in a nuclear war, or asteroid hitting Earth. Hope this answers somewhat your question.<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
My personal prejudice is "both worse and better" forecast. Given what we observed with the ~1.2C rise in ~100yrs: 1) we will overshoot 3C, that will be worse than forecast; 2) the impact will be more net positive, the positives will overweight the negatives in total.<br>

Possible that water drinking ones are no fun, unimaginative moralizing bores, are actually not that great when it comes to opening new vistas, new avenues for growth. One can't execute create things one is not able to imagine. Even when events hit them over the head with a "hey, look over here, stuff's happening, join in", they just cover, and quickly turn their gaze the other way. Possible that there is an overlap between the groups.<br>

Pattern recognition is part of intelligence, but not the whole of it. Fairly confident that there is some hypothesis generation and scoring and searching that's also pat of intelligence. This is what various games engines do, now o1-preview (possibly Anthropic models under the hood too?). We are learning that for both it maybe learning algorithms (E-M, backprop etc) that maybe are part of intelligence too? Most things in the field are very speculative. We discover, make advances in the area, by doing. Our maths is lacking, it's  deficient. Waiting on the Gauss(es) of the 22nd cent for advance there to happen.<br>

I too think more people better. Seems to me current baby bust comes after a huge baby boom. Used to be - for every 5-6 newborn, 3-4 died before they cd have kids of their own, and the population was stable. Then with the improved living standards post industrial revolution, the 3-4 stopped dying. The 5-6 were still born, so we got a population boom for a generation-two. Now culture is catching up with biology. It's remarkable that humans do that (unlike many other species): during best of times, humans stop multiplying. But it will be a decade or two until this becomes consequential. By then maybe AI will be multiplying humans intellectual capabilities so we are still ok regarding research & development.<br>

😄 Labeling them "forecasts" gives them too much credence. They all look like "this thing going down we don't want to go down, will level off at the current level". So basically their forecast is that what forecasters hope to happen. Looks like there is zero predictive power to them.<br>

... it's a moot dilemma, a non existent problem, b/c in reality we can never predict, forecast with 100% accuracy, we always predict with UNreasonable degree of certainty, we are never certain enough for the minority report case to arise for real. Apologise to disappoint on that - but I don't spend any worry on that.<br>
Any forecast is conditional pdf f(y|x), where y is the unknown of interest (crime whatever), x is everything we observe. If we must make a point forecast from the conditional f(y|x) all the worse for us. Even when we don't have to select a point and can use the whole curve, and we know the joint pdf f(x,y) perfectly - we are still stuffed. Unless the conditional resolves to a Dirac impulse and we drop to deterministic world. But that's not going to happen tbh. So yeah - not a worry here.

... but you are not designing the society, no one is, no one can. It's growing organically, ecosystem like, trial and error, bottom up. Any view of a coherent macro whole is a mirage, an emerging entity we construct in our heads b/c it explains succinctly what we see. That doesn't mean it exists for real. It only means - if that one macro thing existed, it'd make our job of explaining the world around us trackable. Nothing more than that. That's why we do it.<br>

True that. But "train wifi" is just mobile network data + wifi hotspot. If the mobile network data cover is missing or miserly, then there will be no train internet either. Even if your device is connected to the train wifi hotspot. Government needs to own a mobile operator of last resort. So that gov dot UK can order its CEO: "go install new masts along the ThamesLink Line, and if not done in 6 months, you are out of a job". My preference be "... off to The Tower with you shd you fail", but sadly lawyers hold the commanding heights atm. And "ah, before you leave - here is emergency planning building powers for you to make use of and *Just-Do-It* ".<br>

IDK what possesses people, even otherwise intelligent people, to exclaim with flair "X can never - never ever!! - do Z". How can anyone say such a thing, given 1) historic precedents; 2) X can't, but Y similar to it, can now do Z; 3) real world is not mathematics, in the real world we can't prove "solution X to Z does not exist, no need to search for X, you will not find it" like we can in mathematics. Specifically "LLM-s can't do Z" genre is easily countered by "if it can predict with great accuracy, then it knows; if it knows, then it can do". Just baffling. Still - at least LeCun s not a beclowning himself  G.Marcus-way. Small mercies.<br>

The radical transparency of STAR (as summarized in the interview - can't be bothered to read it all) strikes me as  good. All AlgoFeed-s open sourced, info and justification of any and all bans (accounts, posts), all adverts served out in the open for all of us to see, courts using current laws on the books adjudicating as needed on disputes. S230 must go - atm it allows for SocMed to cover their own lazy-crazy - but that's for US. @Imi_Ahmed does his argument no favors at times by being tad too political or partizan - but hey, we all have own biases, that's fine. STAR strikes me as good. Let's get more openness to start with, then see what next.<br>
Wish we cd make UK gov adhere to similar radical transparency "all open by default" but that's another issue. Making Social Media open and transparent Re: the automated editorial decisions of their algos - algo feeds, algos banning account and posts etc, algos serving adverts, the adverts themselves - is a nobrainer tbh. Given how politically inept the techbros are - surprised their secrecy lasted this long.

Wow. The woke-right, the righto-crazies (what's an accepted term?), are as innumerate as the woke-left. Don't fancy the horseshoe much - but can't deny this. Stoopidity levels off the charts, asylum-for-the-insane levels of delusion. Once departed from reality, there is no penalty to maxing out on that.<br>
IDK what muskians think they'll do in that asylum. Crazies will eat them for breakfast, techbros will be out on their ear within 6-12 months of a Trump admin. They will fail to kiss kings ring, they fail a loyalty test. Probably the 2nd loyalty test. I anticipate they will swallow the sh*t the 1st time, against their own better judgement. Come 2nd time - they'll fail. To pass multiple tests, one has to be levels of insane indistinguishable from the crazies we see. No sane person can pass. That's the point.
How loyalty filter works: the dogs are presented with a sane option (that every reasonable person wd take), and an insane option (supported by the king). Taking the sane option disqualifies you. Take the insane option - and you earned an extension to your stay on the kings court. (until the next test)
Technbros will end up like Bannon or worse.

Stop beclowning yourself and those whom you represent. Worry not about musking of twitter. Don't look into your neighbors yard—tend to yours. What are you doing with your yard? Europe had the computer revolution, then missed the Internet revolution, and now you are hell bent on missing the AI revolution too. All 4 "grandfathers of AI" are European. The 3 that moved over to the Americas changed the world. The 4th one stayed behind (nicely comfortable in his own lab?—very European) has been reduced to schmidhubering from the back of the class.<br>
Previously Linus Torvalds—a European who wrote (and continues to write still) half of the OS powering 90% of cloud computing (Linux in the GNU/Linux combo) and half of the OS running 70% of smartphones (the Linux kernel in Android). But no longer residing in Europe too. Notice a pattern yet? With the application layer on top of it one half being Tim Berners-Lee’s HTTP protocol and HTML format (and its descendants). The other half being the browser descendants of @pmarca
's Mosaic on the client side.
And at the dawn of computer age there was ARM. Now on NYSE. The pattern continues. Originally "Acorn" RISC Machine, now promoted to "Advanced" RISC Machine. Inflation in titles but otherwise very much into doing more with less—very European. ARM powered Apple’s devices from the aptly named Newton, when no other chip could. Then by offloading its stake when in dire straits, possibly saved AAPL from bankruptcy. Letting it fight another day and bring  iMagic to the masses. A double First for ARM there. Possibly a poster child for the best of British and European cooperation. (lesson for post-Brexit - maybe?)
That was computers. But the list reads longer if we count other non-computing technologies.
Energy. Nuclear power could have been a cornerstone of Europe’s energy strategy, especially after France's early success. Instead of EU following France's lead, EU follows Germany. Germany!! With its historical 20th century record. Ofc, stellar result follows: increased reliance on imported natural gas. From that great ally of EU - Russia.
Speaking of gas—fracking. Another miss. Natural Gas extraction maybe phased out for good reasons, but then, buying gas from elsewhere is not "phasing out". It's simply—doing it elsewhere, and creating dependency where there was none.
GMO. Genetically modified crops I believe marks a low point in EU science policy. For nearly 30 years, policy was driven by a reactionary mindset. Here EU is allied with the RFK anti-vax anti-gm anti-pasteurization (!! latest) anti-everything crazy.
There is a great deal of ruination in a nation—but the list is growing ever longer for the EU policies.

Inflation in titles but otherwise very much into doing more with less—very European. ARM powered Apple’s devices from the aptly named Newton, when no other chip could. Then by offloading its stake when in dire straits, possibly saved AAPL from bankruptcy. Letting it fight another day and bring in iMagic to us. A double First for ARM there. Possibly a poster child for the best of British and European cooperation. (and a lesson post-Brexit, maybe?)

It will do for now. It's not the best solution. It ignores the AI tools, the use of should be part of education. We don't spend time teaching manipulation of 10 digits numbers to kids. Yes kids now are slightly more stupid than their predecessors for that. They can't even compute logarithm by pen and paper. As humanity gets collectively more intelligent, the individual humans can be less intelligent, and the society still works. Neanderthals had bigger brains 🧠 than us I think. It's fair to assume they were more intelligent than us sapiens.<br>

UK - get on a France-style nuclear building programme today. If/when the catastrophe pans out or not - electric energy will still be needed for bunch of other stuff. Little chance to both though - AMOC collapse and a building programme. The former is out of our hands, but on the latter, people are just lazy. Law-econ-wordcel-NPC-s command the heights of the UK society atm, and boy are the lazy nondoers mofos. Would rather sit on their hands than take non-zero risk in anything!

If you are still in the feelings stage - commiserations, sorry for your loss. I'm not mockfull, this is genuine. I have been online since before Internet, and unlike many, I get it it's a genuine loss of a community of like minded people, and it pains everyone that experience it. Even those tempted to mock - they suffer too when the same happens to them. All us humans are social creatures.<br>
If you have moved onto the solutionism stage: open accounts on both (all), see for yourself how goes. There is not a law against having accounts - and with the same favorite username to boot! - on all platforms. It's free, and it's fun tbh - what's not to like?? You lose nothing afaics, but if I'm wrong (b/c ignorant - nothing malicious here), please correct me.
I have them on both, and they are only one tab away in the browser rn. So excuse my wonderment abt the anguish pple seem to go through Re: musking of twitter, Bsky etc. I have another 90 tabs open on the mobile FF rn. What difference do one or two (or five) extra make?? I simply don't understand.
We all shd have usernames registered, and have the social graph Follows-Followers lists recreated, on other networks. It's the social graph that keeps us users locked in the walled garden of a social network. Replicating a good chunk of the social graph is half the switch done. Posts start flowing pretty naturally, once the the social graph is in place. People still have to actually post in the new place in preference to the old ofc. Pple assume they need old posts, that the posts  history is important (and I saw paid service sprung up to cater to transfer; for a trivial fee), but this is not my experience: most posts are non-transferable or transfer poorly, b/c they are time-event-context-conversation sensitive and dependent. So not a problem at all.
There's is a collective action problem though, in that not only sufficiently many have to switch, but also the switch must happen about the same time. External event like Brazil ban achieves that feat of synchronization the best. In absence of such thing, it's slower and trickles over longer period of time, or does not happen.
Switchers are going against the "public Square N^2 iron law of network value": the value of the network to us users is in the interactions between us users, and those interactions scale with N^2 for N users (nodes in the network). So the biggest network starts with an advantage, that only grows with time, as any +1 user added, increases the absolute value of a big network more, than of a smaller network. So more users join a bigger network than a smaller network. Comparing approx X:Bsky=100:10 millions of real users (assuming big X bot ratio), ratio 10, squared 100. Do I see as much interesting stuff on X in 1 day, as I see in Bsky in 3 months? Possibly. For me maybe the ratio is lower, but not by much.
I used "Sky Follower Bridge" to transfer a good portion of my Follows-Followers social graph. You may want to try too. I did as described in https://wikihow.com/Import-Twitter-to-Bluesky. Tips - bigger screen better, mouse scroll wheel speeds it up, can re-start from middle of a list, works for members of Lists too! (if you have them - I do) Ofc social networks know all this, so they make it very very hard for the users to replicate their social graph. The only one explicitly offering this from start is @joinmastodon, but they suffer for other stuff. Imo atm @bluesky if a better choice for ex-Twitter-ati.
But again, and I can't stress this enough - there is no need to choose. Register to all! Best of luck.

I think you are right on the no-conspiracy, and you are right on students and professionals paying the price. The students are politically weak when not radicalized, and professionals are small in numbers. It's the owners of the country that ultimately captured the new wealth produced by the doers. There us no other way, there is nowhere else for the newly created value to accrue to. In absence of Georgist solutions, the only practical voice realistic I've ever heard on this is @rorysutherland<br>

The sado-moralist wing on the offensive, sensing unfortunate (for them) turn of the events. First their strangle hold on the war on drugs loosened, now this. How will the said sadists find pleasure in their lives now?? Would anyone think of these poor souls?<br>
I sense Meta-verse to the rescue for the asocial them. Put in a Virtual reality world, and kept there Matrix style. There they can satisfy their cravings, find pleasure and possibly finally satisfaction that's lacking in their real lives it seems. They can torture and put to as much pain as their dark hearts desire all manner of virtual creatures big and small there. (creatures that can't feel pain)

Excellent point! Once you collect further intellectual strength, and gather your thoughts - please continue. Step back few steps prior still, if you will. This is all people in work earning their daily bread by the sweat of their brow. There are people that don't have to do that though. So it's not bad for all - for some it's pretty good. How come? How did this state of affairs come to be? Are these two phenomena related in any way? Or completely independent?<br>

His argument is more convincing to me. Say a bona-fide fascist is in favor of the daily bread. By your logic we should all now be against the daily bread. That's toddler tantrum not logical reasoning. It's a poor guide to how to live our lives.<br>
Yes - it's a tiny minority that the media trains its searchlight on. Reasons why are worthy of exploring and discussing - but are only ever a 2nd order effect. The 1st order effect is that searchlight, illuminating that what's  then beamed into the living rooms of the nation by BBC News at Ten.

Ah - but tech bros storming Washington citadel and completing its making of a fiat currency, by writing some trivial laws and voting them in, that's also a possibility now, no? Pulling the wool over everyone's eys! If that happens - what a time to be alive! The storming part is 50:50 now. The rest will be a battle too - but in a fighting distance then. Technology-schmechnology - the underlying tech can change easily, and address the shortcomings. It only takes slotting 2 missing pieces in place: US gov creating BTC, and allowing for taxes to be paid back in BTC. Even the taxing BTC part is happening elsewhere (even if for other reasons, hilarious 😂). Only small change of that to "can now pay back BTC tax in BTC" (rather than in Fiat) there.<br>

"McCulloch-Pitts neuron (1943)"!! 😅 Remember being taught at Uni 1st intro lesson at a Neural Networks course, must have been ~1990. We were also taught it's called Parallel Distributed Processing now (got a bad photocopy of the PDP volumes too), neural networks have failed, cr*p perceptron can't solve the XOR problem. 😂 (true that - single 1 can't) The lecturer was excellent though (S.Bozinovski @ SCSU now). He seemed to intuitively like NNs bottom-up learning, and was less loving of the top-down expert systems in AI fashion then. There are few interviews of McCulloch on YT popularized recently. Loved this one. 😂 Shirtless shoeless character of unflinching gaze soaking that cigarette with gusto, looking like a condemned man enjoying his last. 😂  Born in the 19-th century no less.<br>

Argument can be made that it's exactly the opposite: that we are into WW3 due to inaction. If not now, Europe then US will be drawn latter when Russia completes its desired union with Belarus and Ukraine, and invades Poland. Only nukes in Ukraine wd have prevented the current invasion. Only home grown nuclear deterrent of Poland and the Baltics prevents that future development.<br>

I have a companion that is never tired of 1) reading what I write 2) replying back with answers, corrections and suggestions. Most things I write of non-trivial importance - I run through it. Most often than not I take the criticism onboard. Professionally, I worked on speech recognition and synthesis  for 10 years earlier in my life. Progress was painfully slow. I did not expect to see much in my lifetime. To think that we are now on the cusp of realizing Babelfish blows my mind. To see how it's done and be able to say "ah, so that's how it was supposed to be done, ah so that works, this is where we were wrong" is a huge reveal to me. It completes my prior education and experience! There will be a closing episode to that season in the series in my life. For someone that wants to know how things are done - very satisfying.<br>

Probably, I wd dearly like to know. 😀 But I fear it's impossible for me to imagine. Because - let us take our minds back to a time when comparable portion of the UK population worked in agriculture. Likely before the Industrial Revolution that began around 1760. ChatGPT teaches me now that approximately 50% worked in agriculture at that time.  😇 Nowdays only about 1% work in agriculture. So nearly all of those who once worked the land have transitioned to other professions. Now, trying to imagine the professions of today while residing in 1750 seems to me an impossible task. The language of 1750 didn't have the words to describe many of today's jobs. Because no one could imagine them. So for me ideas of 250 years in the future wd be impossible to imagine. I think sometimes art and fiction can intuit some paths about the future - but again, all that is very vague, it's a very very weak signal.<br>

Don't expect to stop anytime soon. Journos are in a fight for their livelihoods. Inspired jabs by @Plinz<br>
"... people making a living by having opinions rather than doing stuff opining badly on the technology that will displace them by automating the generation of sloppy opinions" in https://youtube.com/watch?v=3MkJEGE9GRY&t=5580s @ 1h37'.
The "... say you are professional prompt completer, your job is to write opinion pieces that are completely predictable. You will get a prompt and everybody knows what you will be saying, right?" was abt Gary-the-doomster I think, but "... you generate GPT3 competition slop to a prompt given to you" applies to those journalists too.
It's a case of "It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it". And they know it, we know it, they know it we know it, yet they continue.

Thanks. I try hunt down and click, tick, check, every box in any form NHS presents to "allow use all my data pls". No one's ever come back asked for data, DNA or anything else. My lab results etc are usually not on the GP PC screen. I find the lab work date on my a Gdoc health record on my phone and tell the GP what date to look for. They then find it on their PC.<br>
NHS has never sent me an email to my own email address. I get hold of paper, scan it myself, add it to my Gdoc/Gdrive records. Communication used to be: phone I->NHS, sms or paper NHS->I. Currently it's one way web messages via a custom web form (both ways - but no replies or threads). NHS notify me via sms "there is a message waiting for you on the web form, pls check". They all use email internally (and in their non-professional lives), and have all docs in electronic format. I'm mystified as to why they refuse to email me anything. Ordinary communication like lab work result, or GP or specialist letter, to my personal email.

Insane to try get data from people that don't want to share it, while ignoring people that *do want* to share it. IDK why NHS caters to the extreme privacy side. IT can accommodate any level of privacy.

Too bad some may not listen to the end to get to this. This interview by @MLStreetTalk of @Plinz is good but long. The points about "societal slop" are excellent, and the "AI FDA" too. Not enough people take the risks of stagnation to our society seriously enough.
Bonus (few mins after) "... people making a living by having opinions rather than doing stuff opining badly on the technology that will displace them by automating the generation of sloppy opinions" - 🤣🤣 hahaha - yep. (the cherry on the top @ 1h37')

You are trying both mind reading and forecasting the future yourself. Better - trust a person who they are the 1st time they show you. For the US system nothing else is as dangerous as someone in power to refuse  to return power back after losing an election. All other risks pale in comparison. For that risk alone DT support strikes me as frivolous, as taking on unnecessary risk.<br>
Spoken as non US-ian, and having no direct interest either way. I'm pro all things technology and science, but: Musk & techbros will be eaten for breakfast by DT. They'll be out on their ear within 6-12 months. Probably the 1st or 2nd time they displease DT by not going along with some crazy scheme. Bannon style out.
Note that it's always leaders like Putin, Erdogan, Xi etc (and before - Stalin, Hitler, Mao) that order around all those oh-so-very-clever scientists and technologists - and not the other way around. The science & tech skills are great, but are insufficient for group dynamics. Achieving order and unity is needed for power - and guys like Stalin et all "got it". Musk & us techies think it's hard to conquer EV, space etc - and it is! But creating followers willing to die for you while you have no power over them, you can't fire them so they are afraid to be hungry and homeless, only using words to put ideas in their heads - that's on another level! We have no idea. Musk & techies are small kids in comparison - they fail to even garner support of their own side (c.f. CA politics).

Patients that want perfect privacy are free to do so. They are free to gather plants in the forest and self-treat in a cave instead of NHS hospital. 😠
Enough of this catering to the nutniks. 😡
How abt catering more to the needs and concerns of the majority, that are somewhere in the middle of the privacy debates.

Atm NHS tends to cater to the most extreme wing on one side. The technology makes it possible to cater to *all* sides. To those that want to preserve their privacy (as NHS does now), and for those (like me) who care less about privacy and prioritize excellence of care over privacy concerns. Atm NHS doesn't cater to the latter group. I for one am fine having my medical data (incl DNA - please ask me @NHSEngland , you will get it) shipped to whomever. Please make it possible for pple like myself, that agree to volunteer their data, to be able to do so. Why cater only to the side that's against?? Isn't that quite an insane strategy?
Whatever we do - there are risks to both sides of the argument. There is no world in which I get the same care from the NHS when my medical history is 1) kept secret from the NHS 2) available to the NHS. There are all kinds of people Re: privacy. As is their right. Fortunately, technology enables us to cater to *all* concerns: ones that want more privacy, and ones that want better care.
Also people that have told me about their privacy concerns (fine) have also shared medical info via Gmail. Thus giving the same info, "denied" to the NHS, to Google. So they're either ignorant, or the revealed preference is that they don't care as much as they say they do. But are performativelly against "sharing their data" - for "reasons", I guess?? IDK what goes in the heads of most people, can't tell.
Quotes around "denied" b/c that medical info was generated by the NHS, in the first place! So NHS created it, then being denied the right to preserve it, deleted it. With the proviso - ofc nothing is ever deleted in the digital world. So possible that it exists on some NHS server/database, but can't be used, b/c - privacy. The worst of all possible options.
Also, apparently - the "bad actor" in the article is used by Sweden.

I wrote it jest 🙃 annoyed by the lack of consideration by the OP. But yeah - something that will give people the experience. Afaics the metabolic regulation is faulty.  There is hunger signal where there should not be. Fat is a readily available for energy, but the metabolic regulator circuit decides not to use it. As for why such disregulation is happening on a mass scale - afaik no one knows. The most exhaustive list of hypothesis I've come across is this series of articles https://slimemoldtimemold.com/2021/07/07/a-chemical-hunger-part-i-mysteries/<br>

Nah - I'm for abolishing current IP laws. They are a step too far. I don't think anyone should be jailed and imprisoned if they copy reproduce some information I said, wrote, drew, painted, etc. Private physical property protection is fine - if you get my car, I can't use it. But walling off Information as if it's physical - I'm against that. You can copy and duplicate what's written here - I still get to keep it, you are not depriving me of anything.<br>
You are in bed with a corporation like Disney and other movies studios, and wider media-entertainment complex, and yet you think you are some kind of rebel-rebel. hilarious 😂
I like the symmetry of it. If I want to keep my creations outside of the hands of others - I keep them private. I don't have to publish this, broadcast to the world. I could have written this on my laptop, saved it in a file and kept it to myself. Fine. However: once these words are broadcast to another pair of eyes, are read, and ideas expressed here enter their minds - I think it's only fair that the person on the other end gets the right to write down or create in any way they please a copy. After all - they lent me their brain, so idea that originated in mine now lives in theirs too. That's worth something. Seems churlish to deny them that "right", as if it's not the most natural right.
Further, it strikes me on the level of medieval barbarity that we throw people in jail, imprison people for this, marshaling the whole state repressive apparatus (ultimately backed by the monopoly of violence, ultimately deadly), for this sorry non-cause.

Don't doubt X, FB, any SocNet wd do everything possible to frustrate the transfer of the social graph Follows-Followers. But don't think they have to do much - it's hard by default.<br>
The "Sky Follower Bridge" browser extension eases that chore by a factor of 100. It worked well for me. I did as described in https://wikihow.com/Import-Twitter-to-Bluesky . Tips - bigger screen better, mouse scroll wheel speeds it up, can re-start from middle of a list, works for members of Lists too! (if you have them - I do)
Still - painful manual work, 😩 I found like 1/5-th of the people there last time I scanned my lists back in Aug. Even when people register acc on Bsky, they will not be posting much there, so temper your expectation. Still - it's much better today than 3 months ago. 😀
Posts are not really a problem. They are like flowing water, are quickly re-created, and most are time-events-sensitive anyway, non transplantable in content. So although people think "I have to transfer my posts history", in reality, usually noone needs that. If something was that important on it's own - can be reposted.

Hope Ukraine is still capable of pulling off that rabbit out of the hat. They already did much against the odds. If Israel could in the 1970-s and North Korea latter, much poorer countries, in dire circumstances too - maybe Ukraine can too now. IDK what are the Baltics and Poland waiting. For the Russian army to be bombarding their cities? Ofc no American president will risk nuclear annihilation with Russia. US will back down and surrender any and all of Eastern and Central Europe to whomever. Western countries have done it before, and will do it again, when push comes to shove. IDK how is this some big reveal.<br>

I've heard "good people will do good deeds, bad people will do bad deeds", and it takes religion or ideology for a good person to do bad. I think the same applies to smarts: smart person will do smart things by default. Takes ideology for a smart person to do stupid.<br>

Possibly. It strikes be with the "nutniks" like M, there were always there (the "shit eaters", the "govnojed"-s), but the (then) KGB did not have convenient means of supporting them. They'd have to try position multiple persons like this, in the same org, without the persons themselves explicitly knowing, so they push each other through the ranks, organically. But now with social media a new channel opens: donations via subscriptions. With 1000 accounts, FSB can have them all subscribe to Nutnik podcast/substack/etc for $5-$10 a month. That will give the nutnik $5K-$10K monthly income. Which is more than enough for the nutnik to be able to leave their employment (and any connection to the wider society), and devote themself to their cause and passion full time! (without constraints) One could not ask for a better recruit in the psyops game - no?<br>

Maybe make several versions (apt as we will never know for sure 100% abt it), and also add colors to some versions? I can't imagine a poor society wd go through all that cost to create a big and expensive sculpture, and miss a trick and not color it in bright colors. Colors that wd increase any effects it induced in the spectators by multiples. It doesn't make sense - and they were not stupid.

You are right there - I should have written "controlled experiment". Where they have both the baseline of "no intervention", and a parallel world where there is "intervention". They can't have that - so they are experimenting live, operating on the live patients.<br>
When I want to change something in my trading system - I run the change through a simulator. I can compare the "no change" v.s. the "change" cases. I would need to have a very very good reason to put a change in a live trading system, that has not been run through a simulator first. Ofc - no simulator is perfect, there are actions that no simulator will simulate well. Still - those are not reasons to give up on building simulators. But reasons for ever improving the simulators.

They can't run experiments by design (only observe accidental ones). In light of that, one would expect them to have very large and detailed simulators running simulations. I'm not an economist - but I'm not aware of any large scale ones. When people draw 2 crossed lines, or a parabola on a napkin, to justify actions that affect billions of people - I shudder. In my line of work it's similar that we can't run experiments by design (except maybe for very limited ones, on a micro-stale). So the field has very detailed simulators, and about every step, every box in the pipeline. And makes use of a gargantuan amounts of data too, at all levels. There is research, development and production stages. There is development and production in the real economy, but not in the discipline of economics afaik. :-) When it comes to banking and finance, so not the real economy - economics is even more lost it seems. And esp with banks that are creatures of law, accounting, even IT, more than econ.<br>

Tesla models Y and 3 are from 2017, so that's 7 years now. I'm not aware of a VW or BMW etc "Tesla killer", like sometimes one reads about a Tesla competitor by a company from China or S Korea. So not even caught with  the current EV - but the next technology one step up is coming it seems. Looks like FSD is getting close(er).
Multiple indicators 1) ~50 robot cars (taxis+ vans) driving at the "We, Robot" event without killing anyone (yes I know - controlled env etc); 2) Europe customers that had bought FSD years ago getting their h/w upgraded for free read someplace (presume - in anticipation of new s/w update?);  3) A leader at the FSD program (I presume it's now =Neural-Nets-end-to-end) got promoted; 4) Seems next FSD version major maybe bumped to 13 (prior version were 12.x); 5) The recent FSD version 12.x had release note proudly declaring sth like "300K C++ code *deleted*", in my mind indicating "NN-end-to-end progress, old procedural code is not needed deleted"; 6) X AI or Tesla or whomever built a data center in 19 days installed 100K Nvidia GPUs (source Jason Huang CEO of Nvidia); this is something that'd be needed for NN-end-to-end advance.
If FSD comes true - 'm not buying a car lacking FSD next time I need to buy one.

"Why?" is a good question, but probably out of scope here. Typically - good people do good, bad people do bad. Takes extra effort in the shape of religion, ideology etc to make - good people do bad. OP stance is not uncommon, is present in other similar public policy dilemmas (e.g. "No" to vaping as means to reduce smoking, the "natural" fallacy as cure for many ills, etc). I  mock that stance as "sadistic moralists". Usually it's a Gish-gallop of baseless objections. But we all have other things we want to spend our lives on, time is forever limited, so will leave it there.<br>

A forecast: we will continue to be led by innumerate wordcels (of CPSnow Two Cultures), until we get a country wide blackout, of the type that lasts 24h-48h, when people on ICU and similar life support machines die due to lack of power. Like the Aug-2019 London and SE England blackout, but on a national scale. One to require Dinorwig bootstrapping the grid. Only then will public outrage force maybe return to modicum of reason and actual care about safety. Possibly reduce the political power of many airheads know nothing lobbyists that seem to have ministers on speed dial. Heads on sticks will concentrate minds - possibly. We have had it very good for very long. Forgotten that security of electricity supply is not a god given right. But something generations worked together to achieve.

😂 I'd take a risk and presume none of the `parents who bemoan the loss of a "village" ' ever lived in an actual real village. My parents' entire families moved from  villages into the big city when their country industrialized. Not once did in my childhood I ever hear them speak sentimentally about village life. Esp not the way I hear people (that have never lived in a village) speak nowdays.<br>
Thanks to @OurWorldInData I think I know why that was the case: the village life was horrific. Families wd have 5-6-7 kids, only for most of them to die, with only 2-3  making it into adulthood. That alone ofc fills the heart of every parent with horror. On the top of that bunch of other things: back breaking work, the monotony, stuck with random people - some crazy, some evil, most silly, many stupid, few all of that - one'd rather avoid, plus your life depended on the good will of these people too.

...it occurs to me 😨 - they are badly incentivized. If I have zero assets - I have zero things to worry about. Nothing ever goes wrong. Whereas if I have some humongous enterprise doing zillion of things - plenty of things go wrong daily, there are crisis erupting all the time, need to put in work, care and attention to run that.  So if I am a civil servant where my wages are constant and unchanged and I am never fired - I can see how and why the "zero assets" case wd be much more appealing.<br>

Yep. The only reason she's is still in the running at all with 50:50 chance, is that US economy is doing much much better than any of those other comparable countries. BBB Build Back Better Bidenomics whatever - IDK what it is, luck or skill, but yeah, if not for the US economy strength, Harris wd be losing for sure. There maybe small help that she'd not *exactly* the incumbent personally. So there maybe small advantage to her there in terms of a smaller popularity hit.<br>

The one argument I've heard abt how come UK taxes are at ATH (=gov spending is at ATH), while services are failing (instead of booming), was: UK gov lacks assets. UK gov sold off most of the state assets built created post-WW2 in the period after 1980. So it has to pay cash for things that previously wd have been provided in-house. Like if I own an asset like the house I don't have to pay rent. If I don't - then I have an additional monthly outcome that is my rent payment.<br>

The "Treasury brain" is indeed not any brain, but imbecilic "thinking". If I have £300M cash today, and buy a company worth £300M tomorrow, then I have an asset worth £300M. I could sell it the day after tomorrow for £300M (modulo transaction costs ofc). So the argument "X costs Y" is not an argument at all. Other considerations apply ofc: shd UK Gov be in that line of business, or not, what dis/advantages it brings to the table compared to alternatives, etc. But whether UK Gov Plc has got £300M as an asset or cash should not be one of those considerations. It looks crazy that UK Gov wd look at one side, at 1/2 of a balance sheet and consider that an argument. I wd have considered impossible UK Gov to be that stoopid - but nowdays I allow it. It's possible they are indeed that stupid.<br>

😆 I can think how the speaker rubs Marc the wrong way. Harari anti-Trump argument like e.g. Trumpists are like Marxists in they don't care about objective truth, anything serving power goes (so eating cats and dogs, gov controlling hurricanes - all fine). Also that the Algofeed is the editor in Social Media, so X FB TT IG etc should be liable for pushing billions of posts to billions of screens if it turns these were "bad" or "untrue" to some definition of. Definitions that probably courts will hammer out, in trials. Yeah, can see how some motivated thinking leads to dislike there. 😂<br>
Marc tearing down institutions that are supposed to care about truth and reality b/c they are failing - well duh, ofc they are failing at any given time, it's a forever struggle - strikes me as idiotic. These institutions alternatives are not going to grow on their own by magic. Someone needs to build them. So leave the old failing ones alone, and get building new institutions. And we will all switch over to these new institutions, naturally.
The state of SF and CA (from what a read - never been) strikes me as a huge FAIL on the part of the Tech industry in the job of "building institutions". Even in the state and the city where they must wield humongous influence (given how $$$ dependent US politics is), looks like they can't get rid of crazy corrupt wokeists and replace them with people that build things, get things done?? So they fail to appeal to their own tech-friendly base??
That does not bode well for their political acumen. Trump will eat them for breakfast. Within few months of presidency, Elon and Marc will be gone, like Bannon (the previous ideologue) was gone (and ended in legal troubles - even during the Trump admin?). Marc - if he was as wise as he is smart - cd reflect on that it was Stalin giving orders to his TechBros, not the other way around, and including sending them to gulags (e.g. the rocketeer Korolyov).

That Nokia, even after seeing what they need to do, after it was revealed to them by the iPhone success, that a new market is opening/where the market is headed, even after learning *what product* they needed to produce - still failed to produce a similar product, a good enough competitor. And this lasted for 3-4yrs as Symbian, and another 3-4yrs as Windows phone.<br>

Performative disagreement that is an agreement this - haha v.funny. 😁 Hinges on what you mean by "fictional" and or mentally deleting the word "reality" from "fictional reality" in that clip. 😆 As per that clip - "objective reaility" are "rivers and houses". And "fictional reality" are ideas in our heads that all of us have, act on them, and change the "objective reality".<br>
Afaics - you, him, (and myself) are in agreement that "all these social constructs had arose out of human necessity to organize large groups, enforce laws, and manage resources, expand economic activities, enable technological advances and cooperation between billions of people. It’s not their fictional nature that gives them power, it’s the collective belief and institutional structures that maintain them."

They were born in different places, but that one place is France and the other place is America is in the heads of millions of people around them.

Ofc, no one is disputing that. Great ideas, useful ideas, good ideas. But still - ideas in theirs heads. If they were to suffer a stroke and lose all their memories, then we could not tell them which is which, and they wouldn't be able to tell us.<br>

Yeah but when I touch a person, the thing that makes that person American and some other person French, is the ideas they have in their heads. One thinks of himself as American, speaks English etc. The other person thinks of himself as French, speaks French etc. If I don't ask, or if they are unable to communicate to me their inner world, I would not be able to tell them apart, decide is this person an American or a French person.<br>

Explain please. Depends on what one means by the words - reality, abstractions, fictions. Asking in this sense: can one touch a nation, like one can touch a car, house, tree. Afas I understand - no, one can't touch a nation like one can touch a tree.<br>

Not only that, but non-software driven local taxi companies *still* have not created an App in my local area, that allows me to see where their cab is, so I  know they have not forgotten my airport ride booked days ago and are on their way. I think they never will come up with such App. It's not in their power to do so. Booking on the web and sending confirmations back on email and sms took them decades to do.<br>

This! You are right. Experiment that can be done now days: move from rich to poor country, work (!! - important, so your income is commensurate) and live like/with/among the average citizen. Observe the quantity of mental health issues. People in rich countries oft complain, almost with misleading impression "ah poor - but at least happy"... - no! Being in imminent danger of death and other misfortunes is very bad for the mental health too. It's not that only the physical health suffers.<br>
Same for getting old. It's not only that physical body deteriorates. In concert, not only do the mental faculties, esp related to memory etc decline, but also emotional faculties like compassion, capability for love etc - that also coarsen.

Good that everyone has and is willing to express their opinions. Bad that the Algofeed has no idea about the meaning or truthfulness of them. Afaik the Algofeed has mostly meta-data only to go on, when deciding which post to push onto millions of user screens. Meta-data that's chiefly - Engagement (other users reactions), and Timeliness (with short half life).<br>

Tbh - pay no attention. Typical of the genre. A stew of everything in some amounts - wishful thinking, ego massage, jostling for position, ignorance, irrelevance. Even in the best case "ok X can't do A" for it, we are right to not pay that much attention b/c "ok, but X can do B and C - very useful" and "ok, X can't, but improvement that is Y can do A" and so on.<br>

Yeah, now I see have him on a NIL list :-) This -<br>
Assign accounts that are prolific but boring, silly, propagandists, low SNR, low quality, crazies etc that X algo pushes into sink (/dev/null like) list NIL. Then tick "Do not show these posts in For You" for that list in the individual list settings.
But now I Mute-d the acc. I avoid Block-ing as he's done nothing to upset me personally. I am upset by X and ultimately EM that the Algofeed still judges on Engagement and Timeliness metrics mostly, still all meta-data only. I thought by now with all the LLM-s (and DNN-s before) posts and accounts would have been judged by the content much much more. And the Algofeed would take that into account.
Algofeed using meta-data mostly strikes me as being "judged on the color of your skin" phase of the Social Netwrok-s, and would be good to transition to "judged on the content of the character", of each and every one of the posts (and downstream - users). :-)

Possibly it's not shown yet. I got enrolled at some point (not sure why - I vaguely remember X offered, and I agreed), so I get to vote on them. And add notes for others to vote - but have not done that yet.<br>
Someone explained that the logic/istics behind is: find sufficient group of people that disagree on other issues, but agree on the note, for the note to be published. That strikes me as valuable insight. I'm surprised how well it works. Have to look up again the maths, the linear algebra of it - there was some SVD involved.
It's good, but it's wholly insufficient for a network flooded with falsehoods on an industrial scale. While the notes are being submitted and voted on, the Algofeed pushes the Post onto millions of screens. Then after a week, a Note is ready and published. From now on, it will be shown together with the original post - good. If I clicked Like or Repost, I will get a Notification that a Note appeared - good. However - millions of people that merely viewed the original post when the algofeed pushed it onto ther screen - they will never see the Note.
It's the Social Network equivalent to an old style Newspaper correction. A false story is splashed on the front page for millions to read. Then a week latter, Correction appears deep on page 23, that few read. Good that it happens - but insufficient.

Yep, incentives -> results.<br>
Engagement is maximized when 1/2 of users are at the throats of the other 1/2, and that's exactly the result we got. Took time but we are reaching that destination.
I want to get 1000 Feeds, incl some user defined, instead of the medieval choice of 2 - "For you" and "Following". But that's not going to happen. X went wide did Communities, some way towards conference style (current leader in that is Reddit), instead of deep improving the quality of their core product.
Another thing I want to see is RealHuman flag, and I'd pay small one off fee for that. And then to be able to filter on that flag (or not). That's not going to happen either.
TBH IDK why Musk bought Twitter only to leave it to rot. Afaics nothing is improving with my user experience.
Switch to a new platform is but impossible b/c it's a collective action problem *and* needs to happen at the same time in a short time window. Only external event can force that, c.f. Brazil ban.
Best one can do in the mean time is replicate their Social Graph, find their Follows and Followers, on alternative platforms. There will be insufficient traffic there. The "public Square N^2 iron law of network value" ensures the biggest network wins every time. Posts are like a flowing water, are quickly re-created, and most are time-events-sensitive anyway, non transplantable in content. So having your Social Graph at the ready on an alternative place is half the job done. And prudent too. It's free no reason not to reserve your favourite user nickname on Bsky or similar.

Doubt anyone is coming after the Algofeed - but someone should. S230 I am happy to (effectively) protect me, and other humans, and also X from me. However, S230 should not protect X Algofeed, as it's not a Human, from shoving insane dross onto 100M screens daily. Engagement is maximized when 1/2 is at the throats of the other 1/2, and that's exactly the result we got. Sick of that's sh*t. Years pass there's been minimal improvement in my Algofeed experience. Only change I remember was For you and Following separation. That part of the Social network monopoly I hate. No idea how to incentivise X to give me better choice there, I want a choice of 1000s of Feeds. They are asleep at the wheel. Maybe a kick in the backside, some stick is needed to shake things a bit in that space.<br>

I don't want to do anything. I want the wider public to name and shame them. I want them to become ashamed of the actions of the organisation they lead and represent. I want them to be ashamed of their own inaction. I think they are hiding behind anonymity currently. They are in position of great power. They are well compensated (and not only with money) for that. They are not keeping their side of the bargain. They are failing the public they are supposed to (in the widest possible sense) serve. I don't begrudge someone staying an "anonymous coward". It's their choice, and I respect that. However - I don't want an anonymous coward to be in a position of great power over thousands even millions of people. With power comes responsibility.<br>

There's no general meta-rule imo. I wish there were one. I see why pple wd be tempted & wish for one - it wd make separating wheat from chaff, the 0.1% true from 99.9% untrue dross so so much easier. Alas - afaik no such magic exists. There's a good meta-rule to discard someone's opinion though: if they always assume to be telling the truth, if they disallow the possibility that they may err. Their claim cd still turn out to be true - but not b/c they're saying so. Them saying sth or the opposite doesn't shift the probability 0.1% either way. So it's ok to ignore them.<br>

It's not my intention to be menacing and threatening. I am not a Northern customer & afaik I've never ever used their service. But it's my intention to make them more responsible. With power comes responsibility. We have too many people in the UK, well payed and cared for people, people in position of power, that wield that power without much responsibility. I want to see more responsibility from them. Is the CEO of Northern unable to read what his customers are experiencing? Why, what's stopping him/her? Maybe not enough time? Well - I see a few CEO-s here that care about customers. UK companies - I see e.g. @OctopusEnergy 's @g__j . It's doubly so that it's a state owned company! Almost public service that. The impunity mindset needs to change. It's endearing that a member of the public wd jump to the defense of a CEO. Now I expect the CEO to return the favor tbh.

Well - against that, we have the water companies. Private and run poorly - I keep reading. It seems to me private or public is less of a factor. TBH looking back past decade the times I'm pleasantly surprised with a service that was poor previously and has now improved, is when it gets automated, and the human is taken out of the loop. In theory, the human element (the ticket inspector) is supposed to *not* be like a robot-automaton, but rather to take into account the specific circumstances of the individual case, and do the "sensible" thing. That a machine apparently can't do. However, in reality, we may get sensible robots before we get sensible corporations it seems.<br>

Ne. Jas ne sakam nikoj da mi plaka za da cita toa sto pisuvam. Da sakav - ke odam na platforma kade se naplaka. Nema da objavuvam ovde za bez pari. Ili nema voopsto da objavam javno. Ako mi treba da napisam nesto - ke si go napisam vo fajl, i ke stoi na mojot kompjuter, privatno. Nikoj nikogas nema da go procita - samo jas. Jas sakam drugi luge da procitaat toa sto ke napisam. Da im baram pari - ke se namali nivniot broj. Nemam protiv ako nekoj mi dade pari. Ama megu pari i vnimanie - biram vnimanie. Zatoa ova sto pisuvam ovde go postiram, a ne na pr na substack, ili na nekoj blog hostiran kade se plaka, ili na nekoja mailing lista sto se naplaka so pretplata.<br>
Generalno - jas mislam deka mozebi ne treba da ima intelektualna sopstvenost. Jas ne sakam da go stavam nekogo vo zatvor, ako toj go iskopiral mojot post bez da mi plati. Mene mi e ok - ako javno objavam, neka go kopira. A ako ne sakam da se kopira - pa nema da go objavam javno. Nekako toa mi izgleda po-fer.

Ok - ne razbiram sto e tuka losho. X zema podatoci od mene sto vredat $5. I jas mu plakam uste $80 ekstra clanarina (posto koristam XPro). Jas sakam X i Google da zema podatoci od mene i da gi koristi. Koga ke mi dade nekoja reklama - me nervira sto e reklamata bez vrska, nekorisna za mene. Stalno si milsam - imam Gmail, se znaat za mene, i pak reklamite sto mi gi davaat se sr*nje.<br>
Meta i Gugl zarabotuvaat od tebe i mene - ama i trosat na tebe i mene. Sie tie programeri, kompjuteri i dr - se toa kosta. Striktno kazano - zarabotuvaat od reklami, ne od mene i tebe. Diskutabilno e kolku bi naplakale, ako zemat da naplakaat. FB mislam treba da pocne da naplaka - ama mislam nema nikogas da pocne.
Ok "imalo inicijativa" - ima sekakvi idei, dosega ne se najde nekoj so podobar biznis model sto ke uspee. Dosega sto sum videl - lugeto precenuvaat kolku nivnite podatoci vredat za drugi, a potcenuvaat kolku pari se spremni da platat za FB, Google i sl ako ne se besplatni.

There is a little bit that tuition fee paying students lose in competitive advantage relative only to the others. In absolute terms - ofc they lose nothing. But non-fee payers do gain from your lectures => fee paying "lose" in relative, comparative terms, by the "gap" narrowing. Tell them - the non-fee payers attending your lectures become tiny bit better people than they wd be otherwise (if they didn't attend your lectures online). The fee paying students benefit from that, in the long term. They go to a doctor, and the doctor, having attended your lecture, diagnoses them correctly. Whereas - in the  counterfactual world, where s/he was not attending the lectures remotely - fails to diagnose. That sort of thing. Impossible to quantify and measure on a micro- level. But we know it's true on average over time on a macro- level.<br>

Ne bi go pisuval ova - taka?  Nikoj ne me tera so sila. Jas naogam deka e vredno za mene, ova da go napisam.<br>
Podatoci ima mnogu - prasanje e, kolku se vredni. Jas se bavam malku i profesionalno so toa - podatoci, data, koristenje za zarabotuvanje $$$, pa malku i sum naucil so vreme. Edna procenka kolkava e vrednosta e - ke procenam po toa, kolku e nekoj spremen da plati za informacii za mene. Tipicno, luge plakaat za dosie za prosecen korisnik kako mene - otprilika $5 po glava. Tolku mu vredat moite podatoci nekomu drug.
No! - moite podatoci mi vredat mene mnogu poveke od $5!! 😊 Zatoa gi sobiram, snimam etc. 😇 Isto veruvam i ti.

Reform captured the "easily charmed cretins" segment of the great british public. CON-s that can count? I'd not count on that. The result CON-s get will be result of the s/election process. As long as that is unchanged, CON-s will get the same result (c.f. - Lizzy the Lettuce). Amazing that. 😅 LAB changed the party leader election process. CON saw the result (Corbyn), and thought - what a splendid idea, we want the same. Then they did the same change too? 😂 I'm not sure how and when - don't follow politics or CON-s that much, I'd like to be corrected abt when and how the change to "parliamentary party elects the leader as they and only they will have to support him (and his gov) in Westminster". Imo that empowered the crazies, the fruitcakes interested in politics. These people are not the normie voter. These are extreme people, unrepresentative of the wider public. Most people have no interest in politics, and for good reasons. They have better things to do with their time. Empowering nutters to elect the next leader PM-in-waiting for £5 fee - looks like a silly idea to me.<br>

Ok - ama i sega web, www, html stranicite se slobodni? Ima milijarda blogovi i dr. sto luge kreiraat sto se slobodni. Jas gi naogam deka se relevantni za 1000 raboti sto me interesiraat. Koklu znam - Reddit e sloboden, FB e sloboden i t.n.<br>
Jas sum za toa vesnici, TV i sl da imaat i prihod od pretplata od korisnici, i prihod od reklami. Mislam e podobro otkolku samo edno ili samo drugo. Na pr - nemam protiv FB da naplaka 10 den/mesecno. Nikoj nikogo ne tera so sila nesto da koristi li cita.
Cenzura - ok, ima nekoi zakoni i sl. Ako jas te klevetam, kazuvam loshi nevistiniti raboti za tebe, te pcujam ili vregam na mrezava - imas pravo da se zalis. Ne samo do X. Moze da zemes advokat i da me tuzis. Ako se dogovaram so drugi 100 luge da se organizirame da ti dojdeme pred tvojata kuka da ja zapalime - togas e veke javen interes toa da ne se sluci, javniot obvinitel se angazira da me brka mene so policija i sl (ne moras ti da brkas advokati). Toa isto mi e ok.
Toa sto jas ke go napisam ovoj post, i X *nema* da go prati ovoj post na 4000 Followers sto kliknale Follow na mojot profil (no ke im prikaze nekoi drugi postovi, od nekoi drugi korisnici, sto isto gi sledat) - jas toa ne go zemam za cenzura. Nemam jas pravo ovoj moj post sega X da go "turne" na ekranite na 100M korisnici. Mislam deka toa ok. Jas imam pravo da go napisam ova, nikoj ne me sprecuva, i sekoj sto ke dojde na mojata "home page" na X, i zeme da skrola, ke go najde i moze da go procita. Jas nemam pravo da ocekuvam deka sega ovoj post X ke to "turne" na ekranite na 100M luge. Ne mislam deka sum cenzuriran.
Cenzura ima, moderacija ima, ima brisenje na postovi i blokiranje akaunti i sl - da, ama ima zakoni sto i mu ovozmuzuvaat na X (ako saka), i drugi zakoni sto go obvrzuvaat X (togas mora) da napravi nesto. Nikoj nema "pravo" da bide na X (ili FB). Se se toa privatni firmi, privatni platformi. Zakonite se razlikuvaat od zemja do zemja. Na pr - US e edno, Brazil drugo, Rusija Kina - se treto. Toa isto mi e ok, ne naogam nekoja mana. Ako nesto ne cini so nekoj zakon - e rabota na graganite da go smenat zakonot vo svojata zemja. Ne e tuka nesto obvrska na X da se sekira.

Exactly! The IQ we plot it distributed on a curve centered on 100. Plenty are fascinated by the lives of pple 1 or 2 SD or more (SD=15) above. But what about the lives of those below? There's the same number of people there too. That in the lottery of life had their straws drawn short as far as IQ is concerned. (that's a good proxy for many other things) How do the lives of these people look like? How do they live? They are perfectly normal and healthy people, no special needs no nothing. I remember only once seeing a short documentary. Was struck that many things that are ordinary not an issue we don't notice them for many, were a struggle, needing to spend lots of mental energy and attention, also were source of frustration and pain and shame for these guys.<br>

If I were in position of power in the UK, I'd be trying to entice the PMC, and esp the law/layers upper crust of the PMC, to shift from no-change, into change mode. To start with with a carrot catchy slogan of "things need to change in order for them to stay the same". And carry the "... otherwise Trump/Farage/Hallam/Corbyn will be the agents of change" stick behind at the ready. Or even "the Russian czar was lucky in 1907 before getting unlucky in 1917". (for the drama queens there)<br>
I'm honestly baffled by the UK PMC. PMC=Professional Managerial Class, the 9% that run the country (others being - 1%=own the country, 90%=work the country).  We have US to look up to. They did BBB - Bidenomics, Build Back Better, 4-5yrs ago, and that worked. Just do the same? How's that difficult at least in aspiration, as in "ought to" do. Even if UK fails to do it in the end. Looks to me the PMC "Treasury Brain (tm)" still rules UK as if still living in the AD 2007 Goldilocks world.

https://youtube.com/watch?v=toF5PIClNZ4&t=2300s
Ignoriraj go naslovot - naslovot e bas ilustracija na toa sto go raskazuva Juval "kako ne treba". I od vreme na vreme intervjuerot namesto da se nadovrze i da drill down nesto interesno sto ke mu kaze Juval, brka nekoi svoi trapavi malku prasanja sto si gi umislil vo negovata malku luda glava - ama ok. Harari e super.

That maybe a good strategy when there are only two possible options. So whatever the authority says, I distrust them, assume the opposite to be true, and I may come ahead - if authority is bad. (possible)<br>
However, most things about the world do not exist in only two states. For every A that is true, there is infinity of not-As that are B, C, D ... Z that are false. So if USG says "B", contrarian deciding algorithm being "ah-haa! so therefore not-B is the truth!" and then jumping to - "therefore C" (or "D", ... etc) - will be wrong too. One is simply unlikely to hit on the true thing "A" if the decision algorithm is solely "not-B". More likely one will hit on C, D, ... Z - all also untrue. So just being a contrarian, multiplying by (-1) everything USG says - is also going to not lead to the truth.
Even when the authority is mostly wrong. I will be wrong too. There is simply no shortcut, no replacement for explicitly searching to find what's true. That's hard and involved process. So we have courts, scientific clubs or associations etc.

You can treat the supporters like "Lizardman constant" in surveys. No matter how crazy the cause - some people will find themselves in it. Pol Pot had notable support I read. Stalin had support even*after* the Soviets' denouncements and crimes made public. Humans are simply much much more variable, the possible range is greater it seems to me, than any other animals in comparison. We create fantasy worlds in our heads, they can exist unmoored by any reaility, and we are capable of acting on them too.<br>

Yeah. But listening to and reading @Dominic2306 and @RoryStewartUK it's hard to conclude that the Parliament solely is the solution to anything. 😱 More like - how to balance the failings of of all in the triumvirate {Government,Parliament,Judiciary} to minimize loss, while still getting >0 done, while trying to improve them all. Not an easy task at all! There is Monarchy too that everyone leaves out as "symbolic only". Not sure if it's ceremonial only to that extent.

Yeah many such Qs. I take it to mean "the field has arrived, it has delivered, it has achieved success". In that they are right - NNs (or PDP, as I was taught in ~1989 from a copy of PDP Volumes) have delivered beyond anyone's dreams. 🤯 (certainly mine) Part of Nobel committee consideration and presumably remit - is to stay current, on top of things.<br>

Amazing and or amusing - apparently Northern is a nationalized service, under direct UK gov control (since 2020). Food for thought for the "nationalize the lot" proponents there. People in positions of power seem to make themselves willfully helpless so they do nothing. IDK why they seek power then. Some kind of sick game? Trying for power but without responsibility?<br>

So, this afternoon I got home to find a lovely letter from @northernassist telling me about how they wanted to prosecute me for using the below ticket to travel on the specified route at a peak time.
I paid £1.90 less than the fare they say I should have paid.

Entice the law/layers upper crust of PMC into change mode with the catchy slogan "things need to change in order for them to stay the same". Agreed the system is in a stasis, and the crisis is systemic.<br>

Is this related to the upper crust of the PMC in the UK (and US) being lawyers? All 3 recent examples of overreach are law related 1) foreign criminal can't be deported to a perfectly safe country 2) wages decided in court 3) now rent control. All possibly emergent from some primary or higher level legislation, or its over-interpretation?<br>
As the system lurches from crisis to crisis unable to change, we can expect ever more erratic over reaches. Our PM being a top lawyer is not a good omen then. IDK what can be done. Entice them with a catchy slogan like "things need to change in order for them to stay the same"?
Afaics - if PMC refuse change, then Trump/Farage will be the agents of change. UK is trailing US here. Seems to me with BBB already D-Biden are 4-5 yrs ahead UK both LAB and CON.

Yes, this feels systemic, a crisis of the system (I lived in late socialism). No matter who gets elected - the system ensures a stasis, no change. Afraid time waits for no man. If PMC refuse change - Trump/Farage will be the agents. PMC must get it drilled into their thick skulls - "things need to change in order for them to stay the same". I think that message satisfies their natural urges, incentives and modes of operation.<br>

1) From logic - deregulation doesn't address<br>
> when/if there is not enough of it, for the (risk,horizon)-s, i.e. payout's out of reach? We can see on US v.s. UK compare & contrast: stuff financed in US, cd never get financing in UK
2) From data - we've had deregulation for 50yrs now. Yes, there are few areas - the planning system, Treasury brain on infrastructure projects (in wide sense, "regulation==centralization") - where it's obviously needed (but not happening - why? separate issue).
Further. Water industry deregulation was a great fail, I read daily. Our electricity and gas utilities are owned by foreign monopolies. My bills are are ATH. There is risk increase too, as is with anything super efficient. Efficiency up, redundancy down, risk up - no way around that.

Yeah, you are right there is ton of nuance there.<br>
Thinking back at the time in the 90s the context in which S230 arose. This was time of ISPs like Prodigy, AOL, Compuserve, some of which were standalone non-Internet connected platforms to start with. As Internet as is now didn't exist! So they were kind of similar to a telephone company in that we used a telephone to access them. 😁 Like an add-on service, to my phone service. Then with Internet ISP-s started adding services - connectivity to it, Internet email, maybe small personal web pages space, etc. In that context ISP-s got protection from liability arising from carrying user-generated content, in e.g. email lists, personal web pages and similar.
It strikes me that modern Social networks now are nothing like that. 🙂 An entirely different world, almost completely unrecognizable. My ISP that is broadband provider has no relation to X. Not sure what's to be done. This is US and Law - two areas I'm no expert in.

We seem to have implicit abstraction in our heads that X/Twitter is a kind of public square, with many-to-many N-to-N, ultimately all-to-all communication. It ain't so. That N-to-N does not scale to N=100M users, it breaks down after N=10 or so.<br>
What we have with Social media is new kind of Media. But still it's Media. All elements are here, with small differences in operation or business model, and  automation.
When an user posts something, that post is simply recorded on a computer (disk). Nothing more. Yes - it's the user that presses the post button. No - that doesn't push the post into millions of timelines. It's the algofeed that takes that post, and shoves it into millions of screens. Social media are Media, and their algorithms are their editors. The algofeed should be judged by the same criteria as the editor of any old media. X is a publisher.
Example. I follow 5000 people, each posting once a day. I check my feed 10 times a day, each time the algofeed pushes a batch of 50 posts on my screen, a total of 500 a day. It's the algofeed that selected which 500 of the 5000 eligible to push on my screen. And also decided which 4500 to ignore and not show them to me. There's is no censorship involved - I can go to every one of those 4500 accounts home pages and read every one of those 4500 posts. There's no moderation - those 4500 posts are perfectly fine. They are not even totally suppressed - another user may have his 500 shown posts come from the 4500 not shown to me. (the algofeed will on average prefer some over the others though) The algofeed simply has to make a selection, as it's not physically possible to fit 5000 posts on my screen. As simple as.

I use DDG for old style searches, where I am looking for a web site I know exists. But that's abt 10%. The other 90% turns out was I am looking for something anywhere on the web, and I read through the web pages trying to find my answer. Now I use Perplexity, it turns that into a single step: it finds and fetches some web pages, reads through them looking for my answer, and then tells me back the answer. It has back references should I want to check the answer or read the underlying page. Works well, cuts  out the 1st step in the olden way of searching. I use FF and in the Search engine drop-down I select the engine. That's easy. Adding up http://Perplexity.ai as search engine is 1min job. DDG is I think already in the FF list.<br>

Power - yeah, I get that. EM has turned old style media  proprietor, buying himself a megaphone so everyone learns what he thinks.<br>
Money - I'm not convinced that if my experience was better here, by my preferred judgement of "better", that I would then spend *less* time here (surely - I would spend *more*, not less time here??), so then they wd be deprived of the opportunity to show me adds, and thus suffer financial $$$ loss.
I don't get the last part. IDK why they are convinced of it. I presume they do A/B testing, and that's what these tests tell them. The thing is - these are micro tests, while the entire experience is a macro thing. The experience depends on how all other accounts are feeling and doing on the platform, not only myself. There is dependence there, can't just micro A/B test me, then conclude "the same is true for the other 100M users". So IDK if A/B micro tests tell them what they think these tests are telling them.

I think they think if they give you the feed you describe, then your engagement will go down, you will spend less time on the platform, they will serve you less adds, earn less $$$ as a result. I doubt that's true, and they don't have that much advertising $$$ anyway. But somehow social platforms CEO-s have drilled that into their heads.<br>
I hear you. I use List-s to create thematic feeds of the type you describe - user accounts I chose, nothing else. On Bsky there is much wider choice of feeds, all manner of variants, crosses of Follows x Following x Mutuals x stuff they like, repost etc is available. I like it and use it. But there is not one clear winner that I use all the time. I use all of them, some of the time.
No idea why X are so stubborn on this. I suspect it's common human stupidity - "stupid is a person that does something from which he has no gain or even suffers a small loss, but his action causes big loss to another person". Elmo has been a big let down on this too. (in addition to other stuff)

IDK by how much but suspect it maybe "peanuts". This is the kind of penny pinching (@MoneySavingExp type, that I like & have used in the past incl for energy deals; just it's a bad model for this) that is actually bad at scale imo. Tens of millions of people spending lots of time and effort daily to save a fiver a month. I have roof solar + battery, only the installer cheated (they have it in the contract to provide but in the end they didn't deliver it) didn't get installation certificate I need to get @OctopusEnergy out-going (selling) contract. So I don't actually know how much £££ are we talking abt. I'm also aware of the flexible tariffs to use the home battery to fill cheaply at 2am or so then use that daily. And so on. Just think it's a lot of work for not much gain. Ofc - companies will be happy to outsource that work to the Great British public. It's costs them zero! Socialize the cost - why not? They will reap the benefit - sweating the assets they already have even more. I'm of the opinion that after doing that for 50yrs, we have reached the end of that road. There is not much left to "sweat". Need to get on building new assets.<br>

The block functionality exists for a good reason. I'm at loss why people are so reluctant to use it. Even better if X had a better Mute (the current one is half arsed) where - on blocking A, account A just stops existing for you. Blocking is teaching the algofeed what not to show you. It's a legit needed function in the whole thing.<br>

😀 I can defo feel and sympathize with that person, even if it was not as extreme for me. But yeah - liberation!! It's like gaining superpower - don't need to eat, can prob go 36h without, not much will power needed.<br><br>
Persistent +ve bias in regulation e.g. 1 apple surplus ≈ 90 kcal ≈ 10 gr fat/day x 365 days ≈ 3 kg fat/year x 10 years ≈ 30 kg extra in 10 yrs => obese. Most people takes them 20-30 yrs to become obese post-youth => error is 3 times less ≈ 30 kcal. Error of 30 kcal is 2% of daily average 1500 kcal. So a persistent +2% error in the neural circuit prediction of how much to use v.s how much to store results in obesity. Error in the other direction -2% wd likely result in death => can't happen.<br>
Makes sense to me that we'd go obese the longer we live.<br>

Great read from Ganesh — alternative title: “But Is it True?”. A lot of liberals have flunked some pretty easy tests. I’m not some intellectual powerhouse, but even I have to ask — why, how?? They’ve got the tools, the knowledge, and clearly aren’t idiots. Dawkins, their very own rational prophet, even laid it all out for them. What more could one possibly need?<br>
Take the sex-gender debate, a major battleground in "wokeism." Genes, cells, the whole biological setup — it’s basically programming. We’ve always modeled life and everything else around, with whatever shiny new technology we just got. Wheel? We get “the wheel of life.” Writing? “In the beginning was the word.” Mechanistic gadgets? The universe is “a clockwork mechanism.” So why stop now? Computers and programming are today’s best abstraction for explaining the complexity of everything. Use them.<br>
Biologically, XX is the default — female. Half our species gets one of those Xs swapped for a Y, triggering programs that develop the male form. But if the Y-programming misfires or glitches, we get somewhere in between male and female. If the Y programs fail to execute at all, the body defaults to female — there is no YY option, only XX or XY.<br>
In sports, the physical advantage of Y-programming is obvious, yet we still have confusion. An athlete raised female, identifies female, but tests show XY with faulty Y-programming? Biologically female, easy. The faulty Y did not manage to do it's job. But a convicted male rapist decides he’s a woman right before sentencing to get into a women’s prison (and likely continue his predatory behavior)? No Y-programming malfunction there — that’s a man. Simple.<br>
Why women-only spaces? Because Y-programming doesn’t just add muscle — it cranks up the aggression dial by 7-10x. For every women’s prison, there are seven men’s prisons. Why? Because men commit most violent crimes. So the less-violent half of the species rightfully wants some time out from the ever-present threat of Y-driven violence. Is that so unreasonable?<br>
I don’t get how liberals twist themselves into knots over this stuff. Yeah, I know there’s pressure — not wanting to upset friends, avoid career fallout, or keep getting those peer kudos. But the liberal, educated class (9% of society) isn’t living paycheck to paycheck. They can afford to take a hit for the team now and then, and speak the truth, even if it’s unpopular.<br>
As part of this 9% (in a 1%-9%-90% societal split, where 1% own, 9% run manage, and 90% do the work), I’d love to see Ganesh take on more sacred cows. For example, the “health-beauty-organic-green” nonsense — modern-day snake oil. Latest I read were scented vaginal farts! ffs. Or energy policy. How about some sanity on net zero (we share planet Earth, UK alone counts ~zero) and nuclear (JFonda-ish crazy boomers still rule)? And the real challenge: why, 15 years after the GFC'08, reforms all (inc PMC) agree on "ought to" happen, don't happen? A class-like analysis 😱 like Chris Dillow’s @CJFDillow post 🤯 on the futility of economic policy debate maybe? https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2022/07/the-futility-of-economic-policy-debate.html<br>

My car insurance (in the UK) auto renews (~£1000 for 2 cars) and they don't send a single email to let me know it went through. I know - it's on auto-renew, checked the quote ok, expect it, is in my annual calendar. Still - what an odd organisation. I'm sure it's intentional.<br>

"Death that awaits them back home" - I doubt any of that applies to Albania or Lithuania. Millions of tourists visit every year. Maybe some of the judges should be educated or shown what the state of these countries is that way - via tourism. 😆<br>

Have heard @geoffreyhinton say this. There is lots of buildup towards the punch line, multiple steps. So the punch line needs to be planned well ahead. LLMs by predicting only 1 step ahead (the next token) go down a path. Then once at the end, there are simply no good punch lines available 1 step from that point. It's too late. The joke needs to be planned with a view to the end from the very start.<br>

Lets stay precise. Yes - it's the user that presses the share button. No - that doesn't push the post into millions of timelines. It's the algofeed that takes that post, and shoves it into millions of screens. Social media are Media, and their algorithms are their editors. The algofeed should be judged by the same criteria as the editor of any old media. X is a publisher at this point. I follow 5000 people, each posts once a day. I check my feed 10 times a day, each time the algofeed pushes a batch of 50 posts on my screen, a total of 500 a day. It's the algofeed that selected which 500 of the 5000 eligible to push on my screen. And decided which 4500 to ignore and not show them to me. There's is no censorship involved - I can go to every one of those 4500 accounts home pages and read every one of those 4500 posts. There's no moderation - those 4500 posts are perfectly fine. They are not even suppressed in general - another user may have his 500 shown posts come from the 4500 not shown to me. The algofeed simply has to make a selection, as it's not physically possible to fit 5000 posts on my screen. It's as simple as.<br>

There are many instances of nations sanctifying defeats. Maybe as a displacement activity in processing the pain. Unique for PAL-s is: (a) the number of these events (3) in series, all in living memory (b) that has morphed into the aim of destroying another nation. So having achieved nationhood, achieving their own nation state does not suffice. The nation state of another nation needs to be destroyed, that is part of the fulfillment of their nationhood dream too. Impossibly difficult Gordian knot.

Sometimes when on the receiving end of a well meaning -but ultimately foolish- advice from a genetically (or whatever it is) lucky in the lottery of life on food and exercise, I wished for an opposite - a "hunger" jab. To be given to them for the induction of some perspective.<br>

+1 For plotting the full histograms - much better approximation to the unknown unknowable p.d.f. - and letting go of the old habits of box plots, quartiles, ranges etc. Those were necessity when people used to use pen and paper, count by hand, and slide rule was "an advanced tool".

Indefinite time horizon for success (potentially - infinity) effectively disallows policy feedback. "Jam tomorrow" of the type "yeah it's bad today, but will be great in 1000yrs" is not good.

TBS how things pan out. I live in the UK. Happy to see the last coal power plant turned off. Burning coal, then putting the radioactive ash produced through a tall chimney, high up in the air, so it disperses over a wide area, where millions of people inhale it, get a bit of that radioactive ash in their lungs - strikes me between insane and evil. So this is happening day after day, tons of this up in the air, for real. In contrast, terrorist attacks etc are in our imaginations, and nuclear waste is accounted for encased in barrels hard to get that in the body. But hey - to each their own.<br>

Not only that, but: when their ideology is under threat, the sado-moralists go on the offensive. Vaping is being suppressed on way or the other. Anti-obesity drugs were greeted with Gish-gallop of baseless objections, each more ludicrous than previous. Ideology is supreme, and nothing else comes close. Those people are all potential Stalins, Maos, Hitlers, Polpots etc that fortunately for us didn't get the opportunity to indulge their wildest fantasies. (of which they themselves may not be fully consciously aware) "Don't give me a solution - I want to re-order the society and order other people around as per my whims" is an accurate description there.<br>

There are many layers to that and being an outside observer (not from Germany or France or an EU country; not living in one either) my interest is small.

Are they worth reviving really? That no people find them useful enough to use them? I come from a small language, am fully cognisant of the romanticising and the sentimental value. But asking myself - Q: how much human culture and knowledge wd I have missed if I stayed with only one small language? A: a lot, a bazzilion; Q: how much wd I have missed had I learned other bigger languages 2nd, 3rd, and not learned the 1st small one? A: not that much really. Yes it's sad when a language dies, like it's sad when a person dies. Just - reviving might bring back a zombie or a Frankenstein. Dialects are like  proto- social networks. There are downsides to being in a small social network too. The value is in the interactions and those scale with N^2 for N nodes. Yes fine to have a small language an Add to other langs I use. But then why not add a big one like e.g. Spanish? More bang for buck. Unfortunately learning a new language past teenagehood is hard almost impossible for most of us. Hoping to see Babelfish happen in my lifetime. Only 10yrs ago that seemed an impossible dream.<br>

It's a power, can be used for good, and can be used for bad. Isn't what BoJo is doing called "sophistry"? I thought that was supposed to be a bad thing? And for the debaters to be taught "you could win this way, but it is a bad bad thing to do" i.e. with power comes responsibility sort of thing? Something the debating societies wd drill into their members, the way a martial arts school wd drill in their students "to be used for good only/not for ill"? Not a receiver of education in oratory - so these are genuine questions.<br>

The algofeed deciding which 500 posts I see today out of smaller selection of 5000 (out of total of 1B possible per day) is an editor (even if automated), and X is a publisher (even if automated). The users are readers are also writers creating content without commission or pay. I don't see how X (and FB, TikTok etc) are not media companies (as opposed to - a point to point carrier of signals). They are even selling and living off adverts! :-) (mostly; X not so much nowdays)<br>

I imagine people that want to have children wd be the ones using artificial wombs. It's a choice, no one is forced to use one. I imagine in the steps 1) conception 2) gestation 3) birth 4) nursing a baby 5) kids growing up, rearing, education etc having some choice at steps 2+3 is not a huge difference. Just tilting somewhat towards "more convenience, less pain" in those two steps. Not a game changer - even if my original post might imply so. (but twitter - trading brevity for nuance)<br>

We part ways at "unfunded" of liabilities. Yes they have liabilities. The funding happens via voting their annual budgets. So we can't know in advance if they will be funded or not funded. It they vote - liabilities will be funded. If they don't - liabilities will not be funded (and obligations will not be discharged etc). There is not a "bread bank", where I deposit some surplus of my daily bread, for me to use in my old age when I reach 70. It wd be great if such thing existed. It's always and everywhere a pyramid scheme: I now give part of my daily bread to some 70yo (that can't make his own anymore). In expectation of some other 50yo to do that for me in 20yrs time. But certainly there is no certainty. (like there wd be if the mythical "bread bank" existed)<br>

London being in union with Sheffield wd go against "London subsidizes Sheffield" - no? London is not a charity. It must be getting something out of Sheffield - otherwise wd not be doing it. There I claim you see 1/2 of the picture. So what is it that London gets from Sheffield for his pounds? That is the other 1/2 of the story. By saying "X is subsidizing Y" you cut off a good chunk of what's going on. Is my employer subsidizing me? I have a positive sterling balance with them. Same with Germany. Sure - possible to abolish the Eur and go back to national currencies. Germany cd unilaterally withdraw from Eur, at a stroke of a pen. Yet - they don't.<br>

That's what happens in a single currency area. 😇 One might say - this is what it was created for. No-one in UK loses their sleep that London & Sheffield have sterling account imbalance. I also don't lose sleep that I and my Supermarket have a sterling imbalance. 😂 I ofc got something out of the supermarket - not shown in the sterling imbalance. This is the point (one of several) of common currency area. If all national balances were exactly 0, then Eur wd merely be a state run Visa-Mastercard-type means of easy payment. The trader looking at 1/2 of a picture and making claims about the whole picture - that's very much per the course. 😇 Ofc this is now political stuff - do countries want or not want this and to what extent they want it suppressed.<br>

1) fair point - I disregarded the natural gas spike due to Russia war as one-off, not a long term pattern. My argument v.v. energy (a) cheap (b) imported, was: I can understand & allow for (a)-and-(b), or not-(a)-and-not-(b). But to have not-(a)-and-(b) - that's a sign of an extremely badly run system. An extremely well run system imo wd be (a)-and-not-(b). I consider (a) to be very good, and (b) to expose us to risk, that we can't get it when we need it, that not-(b) doesn't. hth<br>

I wd take some perspective. We have the current baby bust, only b/c we had a recent baby boom preceding it. So it's a decline relative to a high level, in fact - the highest in human history, ATH. The fear of yester-years was a "population bomb"!<br>
(fwiw I'm personally in favor of more rather than less humans, think the population bombists args were innumerate catastrophizing, doomsday prophecies of which we have a long history of; but that's another topic - many refs in @OurWorldInData ,  @rootsofprogress , @PessimistsArc)<br>
The population didn't change much for a very long time, 1000s of years. The steady state was: family has 5-6 kids, 2-3 die before having kids of their own, abt 2 continue on, recreate the same pattern => population stable.<br>
Then came the industrial revolution in 1800+s, 1st in England, then small corner in NW Europe, now it's spread to the entire world. (good) There was a lot of technological change (humans learned how to do stuff, that didn't know before), and advances in sanitation, medicine etc disturbed that equilibrium. Now - 2-3 kids did *not* die! (hurrah) But the having 5-6 kids part continued on auto-pilot for a generation-two. So we got a population boom as a result. You can say the cultural revolution was slower there, than the technological revolution.<br>
But now Culture has caught up! And possibly the Culture will over shoot adjusting the population down, where it was previously under shooting (and didn't adjust fast enough). TBS. I'm not that pessimistic, as we have seen humans adapt to fast changes before. But yeah - change afoot, all is up for grabs in the air, it will be whatever humans in aggregate make it be.<br>

There is no escape - there is only front running the extinction, for as longer as possible, to the best of our abilities. As evidenced by the 99.9% (or some other insanely high number) of the species we have evidence to know about, that are now extinct. And our time is not even the time of the "peak extinction", despite all the rhetoric. (that rhetoric again I consider part of the "we humans are special" delusion; big egos, slow learners etc)<br>

Disposable nappies, nappies that soak gargantuan quantities of piss (they gellify somehow, it's a wonder tbh what those chemists/engineers have achieved), microwave to warm the milk just right (without making the bottle hot so no need for two containers, in record time ~2min, while at 3am bleary eyed with baby crying their lungs out), more general washing machine, washer drier, etc.<br>

I wouldn't be so fast dismissing technology. It will not be *the* solution, but it may contribute towards a solution. After all - we have a bust, only relative to a recent boom!

You are right there abt the robot nannies! (AI "help") It's in addition to, complementary. Artificial womb tilts towards "more convenience, less pain" in two factors: gestation, and birth. Out of many factors influencing peoples decisions. Care for and support of the baby being a major factors after birth too. AI nanny robot would be the dream. Imo real world physically interacting intelligent robots will be the last to come. They seem dozen breakthroughs i.e. miracles away from the current state of our technology. Wish I was wrong.<br>

My observation in the UK is that many children (4+) families are either very poor, or very rich. The two extremes. The very poor have their housing provided by the local government (by law), and central government provides Basic Income (for food, utilities etc) for survival. The very rich don't have to work in order to live, the income needed for living expenses comes from investments in assets. So both have in common - don't have to work for living. So this anaegdotal observation wd support the hypothesis that working for a living interferes with having kids. Possibly makes a difference if both parents need to work. B/c we had a historic period when one parent only in the family worked - and seemingly that didn't interfere with having kids.<br>

Possible. It's impossible to know in advance, before it's tried. Artificial womb tilts towards "more convenience, less pain" in two factors: gestation, and birth. Out of many factors influencing peoples decisions, probably more than a dozen factors? I omitted qualifiers with this being Twitter level "nuance" traded for brevity and engagement.<br>
No one knows for sure either the reasons for, or the way to reverse the trend. My best guess is: we had kids when it was to our advantage (summa summarum, tallied over multitude of choices every one of us considers abt their life), and we don't have them now for the same reason. In the grand scheme of things, we decide, in aggregate, we have better things to do with our time, than having kids.<br>

I expect the parents that want to have the babies and kids to raise them. Why aren't they having them now - is a question that everyone is looking for an answers for, rn. I don't know, and no one else knows for sure. My best guess is: we had kids when it was to our advantage (suma sumarum, tallied over hundreds of issues every one person wd consider abt their lives), and we don't have them now for the same reason. In the grand scheme of things, we decide, in aggregate, we have better things to do with our time, then having kids. So less people than before have them.<br>
Raising kids - no, the answer is not the state, and I don't see how it can ever be. Kids need the undivided love of their parents (and other humans), attention, time, care. But I think "love" is the word that describes the relationship kids need best. I don't think the state can ever give love. Even a smaller community - may give attention, care etc - but doubt it can give love. I think it has to be very very personal, 2-3-4 people, can't imagine more than that.<br>

:-) indeed - thanks<br>
1) You are right - it's not the only one. It's two factors -  gestation, birth - out of many, probably dozen? Just that this is Twitter, nuance and qualifiers are omitted for brevity and engagement. ;-)<br>
I agree ofc parenting does not end there. I'm a parent so believe me, I'm very cognizant of that. I didn't think I implied "parenting ends with gestation & birth" - but hey, twitter etc allowance. So for the record - no, parenting does not end there, 101% agreed.<br>
2) To me now, and imo to every human living in year 2224. Birth seemed pretty painful even if I ofc didn't give birth myself => pain I associate with barbarism.<br>
Gestation+birth used to be insanely risky and a major cause of death for mother and baby, but I'm lucky to live at (place,time) where that's no longer the case - hurrah!<br>

No one is banning pregnancy. 😂 You go forth and multiply get pregnant - have my total blessing 😆<br>
GM babies - doubt we will know howto do that. Looks to me 2-3 orders of magnitude harder than artificial womb. (that looks mechanical+control)<br>
Atm ~2/3-rds of the genome we're clueless what's it for I think? We learn it's necessary only b/c cells die without it. Takes us decades to figure how to re-program simple cells to produce insulin in the human body, for example. (news this week abt type 1 and 2 cured-maybe) And this is where we have every reason to hurry, with every day 1000s of people going blind and having their limbs amputated. And the job is to "only" activate existing programs cells already have. Not writing any new cell programming from scratch. We all have a favourite hobby horse to busy ourselves with. Other humans suffering doesn't count much, unless it's close and personal.<br>
So imo with babies will probably be as it is now: no GM, only screening embrios for traits weak signals + selection.<br>

... true so far: but possibly only because we had human brains *only* implementing intelligence. TBS if new intelligences added like AI give us a helping hand here? Like industrial revolution did it for the mechanistic age?<br>
Looks to me the population boom was more an accident & a consequence, than it was by design & a cause.<br>
Until 1800s, the steady state was: have 5-6 kids, 2-3 die before having kids of their own, abt 2 continue on => population stable. That equilibrium was disturbed by  advances in sanitation, medicine etc (technology in general), making for: 2-3 kids will *not* die, while the having 5-6 kids part continued on auto-pilot for a generation-two. Cultural revolution being slower there than technological revolution.<br>
But now Culture has caught up! And possibly Culture will over shoot, where it was previously under shooting.<br>

Will be solved by artificial wombs. Half human race carrying 12kg of baby+life support for 9mo in the belly should be considered barbaric. Too bad it will be left to EM to advocate this, as the rest of us seem to be useless do-nothing no-good lazy arses. So in addition to the usual expected "Yuck factor" revulsion to surmount, will have the anti-EM bias as obstacle too. But it will happen, as - TINA. Then both sexes wd be expected to converge to a common middle uni-sex of some sort. Like few artists intuited abt a century before. (e.g. Bowie)<br>

the scientists you mention are working on gas centrifuges used to enrich uranium (or whatever other material used - not bothered enough to check http://perplexity.ai rn) to some insane purity as needed for Nbombs. def neither needed nor useful for a power plant. if you have strong feelings abt something - you owe it to yourself to research and find out what the reaility the truth of it is, and resist the lazy path of own feelings and vibes stroking the ego<br>

IMO those are Gish-gallop type lies (=kernel of truth + a mountain of lies on top; similar to propaganda, only non-state) aimed to make me prefer 1) put radioactive ash in my lungs. The motivations of the actors are as varied as are the actors - there's a bit of everything there. It works, as  witnessed the way entire generation was swayed to go with the imo wrong choices. Hope that with the boomers (generation ASAS - "as stupid as self-indulgent"?) retiring into their sunsets that will hold less political sway than it once did.<br>

Yeap - we are run by imbeciles. Doesn't matter who's elected. The political system, by it's selection, instruction, its incentives - ensures who ever reaches the top, they will behave and do as an idiot, like their predecessor. Few tougher nuts that survive the journey not completely crushed, are detected, treated as a foreign body infection, resisted and made inert and impotent, until they leave the system. This is a stasis. A problem with the system when the system can't change to adapt to a changed world around it. But the political system has to change - or it will die. Some kind of political reform is needed. To start with - prob roll back the "party members elect the PM/in waiting", and go back to previous "MPs parliamentary party elect the PM/in waiting". Party members are nutters abnormally interested in politics and get to indulge that for a £5 membership fee. Selecting the PM is too much for them - they will always select the craziest one, like themselves. In contrast, MPs making the Parliamentary Party have to appeal to the wider public - voters in their constituency - to get elected. They are bound to be more reasonable and select accordingly. Plus it's more democratic that way, and PM selected by MPs at least has more assurance to their votes in Parliament. There's no Corbyn-type disfunctional schizophrenia where party members elect a PM in waiting that MPs don't support.<br>

Government with 400 MPs majority shouldn't care as much abt Treasury "brain". Replace BoE governor with one having UK interests at heart, shuffle top 10% of Treasury apparatchiks to positions befitting their competences. Ofc a "leader" like Sir Keir PM wouldn't dare do anything as useful.<br>

😅 Well that was naive of me. Ofc "real human" or "bot" flags are not going to happen. Having an army of bots - and treated as if they were people - to determine what's trending, and set the topics of conversation of day, is a perk one buys a social media platform for! 😂 And esp if the media mogul has political ambitions like EM.<br>
Well spoken by @harari_yuval there - "humans have freedom of speech right, but not bots". And - AI bots, whether accounts on X, or doctors helping me and treating me, should identify themselves as such. AI bots should not try to impersonate a human and deceive me.<br>

Well I'm not fan of neocolonialism myself. What global south does it up to them, afaiac they can do what they like. If they had any brains they'd be building nuclear South Korea or France of the 1980-s style - standardized, quick, cheap. It can be done. IDK if improvements in batteries (paired with solar) make that obsolete. Technology speed - hard to see batteries improving *that* fast. But against that - high upfront capital cost, regulatory obstacles hobbling better nuclear.<br>
Geopolitics - you must be aware that an Nbomb and nuclear power stations generating electricity are completely separate technologies. Yes nuclear proliferation increases the danger of nuclear war. But don't think nuclear power stations are a big factor there.<br>

You can't be seriously suggesting that between 1) put radioactive ash in my lungs; and 2) encase radioactive material in a concrete barrel that afaik no one has ingested ever, that it wd be rational for me to prefer 1 over 2. Every sane person would prefer option 2. Radioactive waste has been discussed ad nauseam. Imo another non-issue & solved problem on its own. But especially compared to spreading radioactive ash in the air (repeating myself here - so it gets into my lungs), a much better  solution.<br>

...yeah sounds abt right. :-) For the "if not in your room => you're guilty" heuristic one edge case was when child A took some object Y belonging to child B, from the room of child B, while B was not in the room. Still the heuristic "stay in your own rooms" helped. Then the parent goes to the room of child A, takes the object Y, carries it over to the room of child B.<br>

Some of the above (Windscale) is true, even if NB it was not ALARA that saved our bacon there but "Cockcroft's Follies". And some (dirty bomb) are dangers that exist only in our imaginations.<br>
In contrast, coal stations generate radioactive ash, then put it through the chimney, and spread it through the air, so I and my kids inhale that radioactive ash into our lungs, for real, in reality, happening right now every day.<br>
Fortunately, I live in the UK, so today is the 1st day that the above is no longer true after 100+ years of being true. It's still true daily reality for billions of people on Earth though.<br>
To repeat myself: for real, we burn coal create radioactive ash, then we put it through a chimney up high high in the air, so it spreads through a large area, where millions of people live, so these millions of people inhale it and get that radioactive ash in their lungs.<br>

Hehe :-) - e vidis si programiran. Ne si idiotcik - stom ova go napisa, imas samo-svest, ne si idiotcik.<br>
Strategijata i na SSSR i sega na RU (i opcija za sekoj eden sto saka da ja skrie vistinata) e: nema vistina, vistinata ne postoi, taka da ne ni probuvaj da ja otkries, oti toa e nevozmozno, nema nisto da najdes. Zatoa koga proizveduvaat lagi, gi proizveduvaat vo industriski kolicini. Ke ima ne 1, nego 20 lagi za eden nastan. Koga sum poplaven so lagi, ne znam na kaja strana da se svrtam shashardisan, na shto da veruvam. Eden izlez od taa situacija za mene e da recam - "nema vistina". Ne veruvam ni na edni ni na drugi ni na treti.<br>
Vistina ima. Ili zaginale 1, ili 2-ca, ili 3-ca i sl. Toa sto nekoj na BBC ke izjavi "zaginale 2-ca", a vistinata e deka zagnal 1, ne znaci deka i BBC go pravi istoto. Znaci deka ne se sovrseni, deka zgresile. Ama edno e da probam da otkrijam sto e vistinata, i da zgresam. A drugo e da ne me ni interesira sto e vistinata, da ne ni probuvam da otkrijam. I dopolnitelno - za da ja oteznam rabotata na tie sto probuvaat da otkrijat, da prizvedam 20 lagi. E sega ako sekoja vest na BBC e laga, ili 19 od 20 (a samo 1 od 20 vistinata), covek mora da se zaprasa: dali e nekompetentnost nesposobnost, ili e vo akcija gornata strategija "lagi vo industriski kolicini"?<br>
Ova ne e moja izmislica, e opisano vo poveke knigi koi tretiraat propaganda. Ako citas za Surkov (i drugi "politicki tehnolozi" od negova generacija vo Rusija), ke vidis toj eksplicitno go kazuva. I poveke - koga sum ja ubil moznosta za objektivna realnost (cekor 1), otvorena e vratata da proizvedam kakva sto "alternativna realnost" jas ke posakam (cekor 2). Vo SAD taa strategija ja imase Banon, izrazot e "poplavi go igralisteto so gomna" (flood the field with shit). "Igralisteto" e javnata politicka arena, "gomnata" se nevistini - lagi i izmislici. Pred toa imame Hana Arendt objasni slicno funkcionira propagandata na Gebels (istata idea). Ima eden skoro-citat koj kruzi ama e dobar sumarum, ne go naogam sega bash vo<br>

He is not suggesting leaving them on. He is suggesting not paying them. It's possible to "turn off" and "not pay".  Even - that's the default. 😂 Have to admire the lobbyists and industry sucking at the gov teat. In such short period of time to create an Stranger Things type Upside-down world in the minds of the public. Outstanding propaganda coup. "We will destabilize and ruin your grid if you don't pay" sounds like out of Mafia movie. UK state needs to find it's spine. Otherwise the public will be sucked dry by these vampires.<br>

I could understand if importing 20% led to lower prices. We import something made cheaper than we can make it ourselves - fine. Importing 20% & having the highest electricity prices 1) in history 2) compared to our peers 3) for industry & household is bad. A system run badly showcase if ever was one. This will bite us in the arse in the worst possible moment. Incomprehensible that UK gov 1) can't see this 2) fix this, while fielding a 400 majority in Westminster that can legislate whatever is needed to attempt to fix.<br>

We heard you, you wrote that several times. IDK, don't have any extra knowledge to what everyone else reads - never been there, don't speak Ukrainian nor Russian, can't read their local media.

Yes it is. IDK if Israel can do anything abt the information war aspect. Thinking about it - people killed on 7-Oct were the left- liberal- leaning Israelis trying  to come to some cohabitation, collaboration with the Gazans. I just presume the ones living on the Gaza border were like that - while knowing but little abt the conflict. (even if I have been hearing abt it on the news all my life; in my defense, I come from parts of the world in the grips of similar ordeals; our own troubles suffice for one lifetime) So the people murdered were and came from a group of people ideologically close to the average BBC Sky et al liberal sensibilities. And yet - that knocked "the default" story (narrative) abt the state of affairs over there only for 7-10 days. After that - back to the usual - Israel bad, everyone else (even if an islamist-faschist ideologically, i.e. as anti-liberal as it gets) - good. Was mentioned by @Dominic2306<br>

😂 I admire your confidence. This is complicated and X type "discussion" of gotcha one-upping-the other is a waste of time. The money system we have evolved over a period of time without "from the onset design". Rather, a series of contingencies, modifications and kludges, usually under the pressure of some crisis. Not a creation of a single person either. Can defo see parts that have been re-purposed over time.<br>
For my money the best presentation & best abstraction incl the title I know of is "The Landscape of Money" by @Suitpossum (pic below) on YT https://youtube.com/watch?v=mmWOO7r_NMw&t=6m30s .<br>
Abstracting spreadsheets (instead of rings) works as well. And tallies better with reality! B/c BoE (owned) spreadsheet => only BoE changes numbers up/down in it, BoE decides on the cells accounts names "reserves", "gilts". Likewise - Barclays spreadsheet => only Barclays changes numbers up/down, accounts have names "Current", "Saving", the numbers are "Barclays pounds" that stop existing when Barclays goes bust (c.f. Northern Rock). I admit rings with pounds moving on the wires, running around from account to account, is visually way more appealing.<br>
From everything I've seen and heard.<br>
State money - MMT explanation of how things work atm is correct. Yes there are detractors. They are two camps. Those in the know have every incentive to lie and keep their knowledge private (as they get lots of power from that). I'm in an industry where "those in the know don't talk, those that talk don't know" so that's a familiar pattern. A 2nd group is the "Chorus of Cretins", ones that think UK gov's HMRC raids the tills of the pubs past midnight, collecting coins, so to be able to give the teachers & policeman those coins for pay the next day. Still stuck on the gold standard thinking. They are a lost cause and I admire the @wbmosler -s type proselytizing and trying to reach out. B/c trying to explain to a dunderhead will only result in having your own head bashed against the kerbside. 😱 Feelings run high with money at stake. 😂 Try telling a normie "your money in your savings account is good and positive for you, but is a negative a liability (a bad thing) for your bank" as a test. 🤯<br>
Private (bank) money - think Prof Richard Werner has written and researched extensively, books and articles https://perplexity.ai/search/princes-of-yen-prof-warner-qiFldXIrS7CsjAIeinMbUg#1 I see there is a web site https://professorwerner.org now. (at some point noticed a "Prof Werner" twitter account; I thought - an impersonator; then noticed during covid acc went crazyvax; allow it possible that it was the original that went all "Ignaz Semmelweis" on us; can defo see how that happens to a person driven to telling the truth, in an environment bent to lying on the same subject) Also MMT insight that private commercial banks operate under license and at pleasure of the regulator, the Central Bank, ultimately the State, is very much correct. But MMT concern themselves much less with this particular area/location in the "The Landscape of Money", so imo less relevant.<br>

NB drzavata MK stalno moze da stvori MK denari - ama ima opasost da kreira inflacija. Ne e deka MK nekogas ke bide vo situacija na nema denari, da ne moze da gi stvori. Toa e i najlesno! Pocetok na procesot na drzavni denari e krevanje 2 prsta vo Sobranie glasanje na budzet. Ekvivalntno vo privaten sektor e koga kreditnoto biro na Stopanska Banka odobruva zaem, toa e pocetok na proces na kreiranje na stopanska-banka denari. Opasnosta na premnoug denari, a premalku roba sto tie denari kupuvaat e - pojava na inflacija.<br>
Ova sto go brojat javen dolg se drzavni obvrznici. Koga drzavata izdala vtor tip na drzavni pari (=drzavni obvrznici), i gi zemenila, gi prodala, na privatnici koi veke imale denari (prodazbata e na odredeno vreme - pa e poveke zamena, a ne prodazba). Buidejki dogovorot e da plaka kamata na obvrznicite, koga Centralna Banka ke kaze "kamata 5%", sega se broi kako del od drzavniot budzet, se alocira stavka. Ke gi plaka drzavata tie pari na lugeto koi ke gi kupat obvrznicite koi drzavata tek ke gi prodade.<br>
Makedonija pocna da izdava i Euro obvrznici (vo vreme na Grujo mislam prv pat), sto mi lici da e posebno ludo i  shizofreno. Mi lici deka toa e ogromna opasnost, ogromen rizik. Posto MK ne moze da stvori Eur, kako sto moze da stvori MK denar.<br>

I'm surprised that I know of zero libertarians that see a positive side. (while all - rightly - see the negative sides - the taxation, the centralization) It would be truly a liberation revolution, liberating the lucky humans living in that society, from a deal all humans have been forced into from the dawn of time: be a part time wage slave, go work against your true self, against your wishes and hopes, exchange part of the limited time you have alive in this world for food shelter etc needed to maintain your body, and stay alive. To then be able to be your true authentic self in the rest of the time (allotted to you) unshackled from all other considerations (in that other time). UBI wd massively tilt the field towards the latter, and away from the former. Yes if you are libertarian you see the negative side. Just don't understand how they fail to see that positive side.<br>

I hear you and I like and wish for that line of thinking. However, I fear yours - and mine! - are un- or post-imperial kinds of thinking abt these things. Whereas Russia is going "back to the future" of imperial Russia. NB how our line of thinking wd have forecast a Russia invasion and taking over and ultimately annexation of Ukraine an impossible, a crazy a stupid idea. We see no point to that endeveour. Why wd anyone take over more land - when they have plenty land themselves, over plenty of people - of which they have plenty too, and so on. (and esp at the time when we are living through history being made by creation of AI in that same world) And yet and yet - that's what Russia is trying for atm. Reality >>> trumps ideas in our heads. Obv our ideas about the state of the world in our heads were wrong.<br>

Yeah - I too think that Europe behavior so far is putting us on a road to WW3. Russia's is an imperial war of conquest. Occupied territories are annexed, new language new identity imposed, citizens there become subjects, possibly to be drafted in future wars. A pattern well known in Europe. The original meaning of the words like colonialism, imperialism. People rightly complain abt US wars. But one thing US doesn't do is say annex Iraq or Afghanistan and say "here is our latest 51-st 52-nd etc State in the US federation of states". Imperial wars of conquest will erupt all over Europe and devastate Europe for the 3rd time in but 100 years. Can Europeans be this terminally stupid?? I thought no one can be that stupid, but now I think it possible. Right EU response wd have been for all EU states to do what Poland did and ramp up defense spending to 4-5-6%, start re-creating the defenses industries, re-arming etc. No one in EU should expect for US to fight their wars. US may help latter (c.f. WW1 *and* WW2; pattern repeat twice) - but EU countries have to lead.<br>

Yeah - no good options. One way to forestall WW3 we're descending to, maybe for Ukraine to re/acquire a nuclear deterrent, in concert with Baltics & Poland & Finland that also need it badly. They are in the position of e.g. Israel and NKorea - facing existential threat of superior neighbors bent on their destruction. IDK what else - no good options. RUS taking over UKR and BLR (once Luka is dead) and creating NeoRussia is a step preparation to invading the Balts, then Poland and Finland. Danger that US and EU cowardice persuade RUS to take the gamble. And then West wakes up and finally puts boots on the ground. But by now in direct hot war and with huge risk of a nuclear holocaust. This article imo relevant and prophetically timed (weeks before latest invasion).<br>

Yeah IDK what happens there. From N=2 anegdata pple I know 1) not completely innumerate, but (bit surprising to me) numerate enough 2) 1 massive narcissist, 1 big ego (also - forever on guard against being taken advantage of? not sure that relevant) 3) assumption the universe owes them something, to - for me seemingly - high-ish expectations 4) universe fails to deliver well enough 5) seething angry how things are, how things are turning out 6) numerate enough to pick a bone, find a small crack in the (usually) interpretation of some data 7) an entire edifice is erected on the top of that tiny grain, tiny kernel of possibly valid criticism. Example - estimate of a parameter or effect maybe more just to say "it's 30%, not 27%" and that is now obviously sufficient reason to reject everything - counting, numbers, maths, data, reason, logic - all the way back to dawn of time. And rely on what? - chicken entrails? voice in my head? - to guide me through life. Just total lack of proportion. If it fails my super high ideal criteria => obv total rubbish, never to be used for anything, and neither anything else similar to it.<br>

Fiat currencies have (so far) been a blessing to the human species. Our medium of exchange, measure and store of value, being under human control, is a super power. Power that can be used for good, or abused badly. It's up to us. Looking at the currency (one side of the ledger) without looking what that buys (all the goods and services created by US, for consumption of its citizens) is just stoopid dofus Homer type "reasoning". Undermines everything else you write via Gell-Mann amnesia argument. I'm very sorry to say.<br>

Afaik his "perceptron can't solve XOR" was wheeled out frequently. I was taught NNs on the PDP notebooks (Rumelhart & Hinton?) in ~1990 (prof S. Bozinovski).

Thanks 🙏 I understand the graphs, and close to 300% is indeed the 12mo rolling inflation measure at some point in time (it's seen on the graph). I am saying @IsabellaMWeber is misleading us by blaming Milei for that. Further, I understand that it's opportune for her to do so. But I expect better from her. I don't want one set of politically motivated misdirection (almost lying; lying with plausible deniability, if you like) to be replaced by the same but now coming from the next generation (that will hopefully replace the current discredited establishment). It's possible to win while not being dishonest.<br>

I'm always somewhat amused by the spin e.g. BBC News puts on events when reporting (but also - other UK broadcasters). Current headline "Bowen: West left powerless as Israel claims its biggest victory yet against Hezbollah". The spin is - as if this is still year 1945, as if still Brittan is of some importance there, a factor influencing the events this way or that way, and now UK was asked, or not asked, or approved, or didn't approve, for this that or the other. It feels out of time to me tbh. Afaics in reality - Israel for sure doesn't ask anything of UK, or anyone else, but the US. And even with US - between $$$ contributions influencing US politics and AIPAC - not sure which is the tail and which is the dog in that wag even! Hell - Israel has got their own independent nuclear deterrent that UK seems lack these days. Not sure Israel care, or even if they should care, about anything anyone says. Seems there is tons talk from 100 sides, and little skin in the game. So not sure how much one can blame them much.<br>

Nah—US-EU Co-Co (Cooperation and Competition) is working well. The US is excelling at Development!! But maybe not so much at Research?? Are US-ex-California-ians maybe tad too conformist, not bold enough to "boldly go where no one has gone before"? (haha 😂 — now brace-brace for x.com/AlecStapp/stat…<br>

Similar to before, you are reading something that it's not written there. There is no TINA in what I wrote. Keep to the particulars, and the general points will take care of themselves. Not everything is a general principle. There is top-down, but there is bottom-up too in this world. 😇<br>

Very meta-econ this. 😂 75yrs Ago, politicos cried for a "one handed economist", b/c there was an over-supply of "on one hand, on the other hand" two handed economists in their world. Seems that has been remedied... 😂 - only now we are supplied too well with "one handed economists", but lacking two handed ones?? How is this even possible.<br>
Surely you must be joking @IsabellaMWeber<br>
 with that "inflation shot 300%". Are you going to make yourself into another "umbrellas cause rain" Gell-Mann amnesia tale? Enough with this "being right once in a lifetime" econ b/s. When 2010 EU has 0% inflation - one set of policies is called. When 2024 ARG has 300% inflation - another set of policies is called. How is this hard for anyone to internalize? Engineers, doctors, plenty of professions do it all the time, have no trouble at all with the concept "if something is lacking - add; if something is too much - remove". ffs<br>

After Milei abolished price controls & slashed government spending, inflation shot up to ~300%. 3.4 million Argentinians pushed into poverty. Poverty rate highest level in two decades. At least 136,000 jobs wiped out.<br>

Yeah agreed on austerity, on its own has no redeeming features. But here 1) it's not on its own, 2) it's not long term, but short term. Argentina are trying to get inflation down, and it's a political choice. Majority voted for this as the least bad option.<br>
Europe 2010 had no inflation to speak of. Argentina is entirely different. I think it's obvious, that depending on the diagnosis "what ails the economy", a different course of action is called for. If 250% inflation - then one course of action. If 1% inflation - then a different course of action. This shouldn't be controversial. Further - nothing is forever. Once the state of the economy changes, then change of economic policy is called for.<br>
IDK of your life experience, but having grown in a socialist country (not in the Soviet Union, not in the Eastern block even) in the 1980-90, the level of dysfunction in that economy was something no one now in the West I know could internalize. It was an order of magnitude greater dysfunction than anything I've seen in the capitalist economy (UK) in the last 25 years. Layers of problems piled up on top of each other for decades, left unsolved and festering, interacting and re-enforcing the individual effects (each bad on their own solo). B/c the system as setup discouraged solving any problems, so they just piled up. (until the whole thing blew up)<br>

You are anti-steel-manning there, taking the easy way, ultimately doing yourself a disservice, by going "evil Milei out to inflict suffering". They had inflation problem for a long time. That's the elephant in the room - the persistent inflation that Argentina (the elites, the people - everyone ultimately) was unable, unwilling to fix. Fwiw I think 1) it's the only move left 2) they are replacing one problem (inflation) with another (unemployment) 3) it maybe a step forward rather or backward, tbs 4) will be a step forward iif the next step is - tackling unemployment. That will in turn create different problems, that will have to be tackled when their turn come, and on and on<br>

@MrBeast Productions Manual (discussed online last week) made a surprising (to me, then) argument why and how YouTube will be much much bigger than any of us imagine. To me looks like YT production values in terms of Signal-to-Noise Ratio to the viewer are already there. I find lacking in various ways 95% of non-YT content these days. That I probably wouldn't have minded 10yrs ago. I thought it's just me. But then, looking around & asking f&f this past week - seems I'm not the exception but the rule. Living in interesting times.<br>

wrong job. I genuinely mean that. Youtube is the future and I believe with every fiber of my body it’s going to keep growing year over year and in 5 years Youtube will be bigger than anyone will have ever imagined and I want this channel to be at the top. Which is why I say we are not Hollywood. 99% of movies or tv shows would flop on Youtube. On top of that they'd be wildly unprofitable, have no flexibility, and long lead times that can’t adapt to trends. We arn’t here to make a small movie once or twice a year, I want to make one a week lol. Which is why you need to be nimble and produce content OUR way, not the way you were taught before. If you want the highest probability of success I beg you to learn<br>

There's evidence for- and counter evidence against- both hypothesis. None raise in totality to the level that's acceptable for a consensus to the scientific community. For various complicated reasons and by chance being in a position to, natural origin proponents tried to shutdown the competing hypothes consideration too early. Trying to win this one battle that way. They were unlucky that no sufficient evidence for their hypothesis emerged since. There exist two camps in that science community: Gain of Function proponents, and Biosafety proponents. Depending what one prioritizes. Institutionally gov agencies lean too much towards GoF and too little towards Biosafety for my taste. It's an outlier for a regulator to be radical rather than cautious. The covid origin battle was just the latest battle in the ongoing war between these two camps. In an ideal world we'd forget abt the stupid needless currently impossible anyway "AI regulation" and devote 20% of attention heaped to it to Biosafety.<br>

If you say so. I don't have any special knowledge about the inflation over and above what I can read online, like here https://tradingeconomics.com/argentina/inflation-rate-mom or here https://statista.com/statistics/1320016/monthly-inflation-rate-argentina/ . That data reads as if the inflation is past its peak. Ofc a single number is some "representative average". While each and very one of us has their own "my personal rate of inflation" of prices changes of whatever we personally buy and consume etc.<br>

Yes - to govern is to chose. #AbolishTheTreasury<br>
My 2p diagnosis of our ills: UK central gov is ultra centralized in Whitehall (#1) (almost Stalinist in that), and then that centralized power is further held in a stranglehold by the Treasury Brain-Deep State-OBR complex (#2). Together they are Centralization^2.<br>
Atm that ensures - #1 nothing can be done by anyone else, and #2 they've settled on "do nothing". B/c everything costs money, and #2 care disproportionally more about that cost, and much less about what capability, assets etc that cost buys UK. Once nothing tangible is done, laziness is naturally encouraged, activity punished, every promotion every jostling in the hierarchy becomes entirely a beauty contest, divorced from any real-word results. This as seen from afar by outsider without any insider knowledge. Just listening to @RoryStewartUK and @Dominic2306 relying info on the inner workings of UK gov machine.<br>
If I were a UK BDFL, working backwards, I'd lean into point #2 first, and or point #1 next.<br>
Choke point #2 means smash the power of the Treasury. They are a good servant, but a bad master currently. No.10 needs to re-assert itself over and above No.11 by 1st-ly taking decision powers out of No.11 hands. No.10 has to work much more on getting things done, take interest in it, let go of the media PR Circus it's devoted to atm. Just assume you'll serve 1 term (or less!), drop the "permanent electioneering mode", don't think of re-election, try get stuff done. Assume you've already run out of time! Can't see how a change like that can come but directly from the top, from the PM. Supported by primary legislation & MP votes in Westminster to dismantle the 1000 roadblocks thrown in the way.<br>
Choke point #1 means decentralization of power. UK used to have vigorous local authorities that cd innovate in various ways. Admired once at the riches of a local gov building in Birmingham. The idea that some pimply fresh graduate 25yo SpAd 120mls away in London wd be telling these people how many pencils they can buy I presume wd have struck people running that City gov as absurd as is a Monty Python sketch to us.<br>
Mid-term UK must build a 2nd 10mil strong city agglomeration Liverpool-Manchester-Leeds-Sheffield-Hull. By connecting them with transport links, building housing along the links for commuting whichever way people fancy. Increased value of the land b/c commute/jobs finances the buildup itself. With Birmingham half-way between this new MegaCity and old London. London gets some competition, raises its game too. Atm feels no acc/London but coasting because TINA. (London cd e.g. respond by completing the Golden triangle LDN-OXF-CBG).<br>

Well - hello. Better now than never.<br>
But yeah - thinking "I & the world are one" is what we all as babies start with. There is no difference between I and anything ex-I, it's all one big "I" in the baby world. (so when baby is unhappy b/c it's been wronged, the crying is totally sincere; even if the warm milk was delayed by mere 30 sec!).<br>
Then growing up, most of us we move mere few centimeters to the "I'm the center of the universe and most important thing in it". This is why accepting the universe does not revolve around the us (i.e. the earth), we're a leaf in the tree of life (many other leaves there too), we're not masters of ourselves (unconscious), we are not the only rational things (AI, other animals) - is such a huge - and completely sincere too! - trauma for us. With toddler tantrums galore.<br>
I presume it must be evolutionary? Babies feeling - nah, I may as well not eat, will donate my molecules etc making my body, "Lego blocks style", to the next living creature - they don't survive long enough to pass that to the next gens.<br>

Trading unemployment for inflation is the right call for them atm imo. Trouble with Milei is guided (blinded?) by  his ideology he may say "it's 100% your problem, independent individuals, and 0% mine".<br>
I know nothing abt ARG. But I know a lot abt similar high inflation disfunctional country of my youth. Causation is {badly run badly governed}->{unemployment,inflation}. One can trade unemployment and inflation, one for the other, in varying degrees. Whether gov chooses to inflict a lot of misery to few people (and anger very much, but a few), or spread the misery lot to many people via inflation (and mildly annoy, but large number of), is a political choice. ARG used to have the latter for a long time, until "mildly" became "very much" annoyed and they elected Milei. He is doing what he promised - and switching to the former.<br>
If Milei were planning his next steps, he'd be planning how to help forces in ARG that reduce the misery in total. IDK abt the country to try guess what's possible there.<br>

Yeah - not easy at all. In addition to logic that is a good route for those that can take it (b/c logic itself is hard for most too), I have seen people find a route through rhetoric, oratory, learning more formally to argue and debate?? That wd not have occurred to me - that there maybe a route there. First with use of qualifiers (none, at least one, none, some, any, all), and then when making chain of arguments, pointing to students "well what you are doing now is formally called modus ponens" have seen it surprisingly effective. And later telling them abt (less used) modus tollens. Seems once the former is  point out and recognised, the latter is imbibed very naturally.<br>

Data is hard for 95% of us. CP Snow "Two Cultures" is biting UK decision making by the backside repeatedly. If the humanities portion of the elite (in the UK 70-80%?) put effort to internalize become numerate, that wd be a huge win. (the numerates are already literate)<br>
Now abt the 80-90% that are the non-elite ordinary public, reasoning from I-myself-first-foremost-only anecdote, and elevating their own experience to be 100% everything, and everything else to count 0% nothing, is tbh understandable in comparison.<br>

😊 reminded me how the morning after having LASIK was incredible indescribable 🤯😲 wish i had an artist in me to relay to others how miraculous it was; i don't condone but i understand how people come to believe in supernatural miracles 😇 LASIK was a miracle made real 🤩<br>

Може ќе бараат не знам што ќе добијат. Еве реално северно Косово за Прешево замена делови на територии може ќе го реши проблемот (а може и не) "нормализација" Косово-Србија, ама не се случи. Моментално огромна војна во Европа за менување граници - сите се против тоа. Да во 90-та успеа Косово да се одвои - ама тоа и тогаш а уште повеќе и сега личи дека беше "најмалку лоша опција" што им ја остави Слобо на САД+Европа. Како Албанците во Македонија има 300 такви случаи ситуации распрскани низ Европа. Не гледам апетити за менување на било што. Ако нема репресија дискриминација или сл - мислам ќе има нула поддршка. Вклучително и од Албанија.<br>

Кој ги знае. Полесно им е да извадат албански пасоши (не знам колку Албанија е дарежлива со тоа?) и да шетаат и да живеат како и каде сакаат. Не гледам дека има некаде некој голем ентузијазам за нови балканистани, шерифлуци, башибозуци и сл.<br>

Yep - choice is good, to each their own. Even single me - sometimes I prefer the 1st, other times I prefer the 2nd option. IDK why this needs to be said. Seems to me - many people can hold 1 idea in their heads, versus somewhat fewer people that can hold 2 ideas in their heads. By the time we come to the people that can hold 3+ ideas in their heads without those heads exploding - we run of of people?? 😇 Maybe the heads of these 3+ ideas people really did explode?? 🤯 Scary stuff 😱<br>

Consideration goes both ways. But ask yourself: who's suffered more so far in history? The society from - one bad apple spoils the entire barrel of apples? Or the individual from - the tyranny of the majority?<br>
There can be more balance in the UN. As with any organization or club where some are members, and others at not. UN has a charter, in theory members subscribe to it voluntarily. UN has to decide: what to do with members that blatantly break the charter, but don't leave the UN. Obv they get something out of their membership - otherwise they'd have left. Individual abusing the collective if you like. :-)<br>
UN could split the difference. Keep the charter breakers in the UN (stay inclusive as much as possible, keep the "global club of all of humanity" idea alive; don't repeat the League of Nations errors), but sanction them within the organization. E.g. - can't chair a committee, suspend voting rights and so on. Show them "we think you broke the charter you promised to uphold, and we don't like it" at least.<br>

IDK, and don't think you or anyone else can know either. Until we have some kind of Cliodynamics-Psychohistory history working, doubt much can be said with certainty about cause-consequence. Plus -  complicated systems we observe of in nature, usually they have feedback loops, are push-pull, there is not one-way simple clear feed-forward cause-consequence. If anything, in absence of much knowledge (theory as well as data), a fair assumption would be: both, both cause and consequence, about everything. I admit not very useful, and the hardest to work with. Slavery - all empires had slaves, previously similar geography Roman (& successor Byzantine), none developed hockey stick graph above. Same for gold - all empires use precious metals in their money (=unit of measure, medium of exchange, store of value), none got the hockey stick.<br>

Sure - only thing with that: that debt is owed to someone. The one in debit has a liability, but the one in credit has an asset. It's equally right to say: there are assets worth 330% of global GDP (nominally). There are no Martians involved, we owe everything to ourselves. And before you involve grandchildren inheriting our sins - same goes for them too. Some will inherit liabilities (debt), others will inherit assets (credit). Or if you prefer - there will be matching virtues for all sins inherited by the children off their parents. Zero is a mind bending concept.<br>

Exactly. Sooner rather than latter AI companies will work  out that when the public asks "please AI do X for me", and AI replies "I'm sorry, I can't do X for you now, it's against my rules", that AI Co.s can then go back to the public with "AI safetists are the reason the computer says NO". The public will happily apply pressure to their politicos, and them to their bureaucrats. It will take time for the scenario to play out, but as we see on the EU stupidly insane "regulation": the public don't have that much patience with the bureaucrats that donned the "AI safeist" clothes in the latest fashion change over. Good development that one imo. Previously NPCs wore green and worshiped at the feet of St Greta - always in tune with the latest fashions is part of their job description tbf. For all the disparagement of the public mental faculties - for things that matter to them and influence their lives, the general public is clued up sufficiently.<br>

The deep state bureaucrats are indeed running the show and creating facts on the ground (rather than - merely policing existing best practices), but only b/c politicians and legislators have relinquished responsibilities.<br>
Walking backwards from that. They are too busy performing as circus acts, for the amusement and entertainment for the votes of the idiocracy they compete for, in tandem with dancing to the tunes of the SuperPac donors competing there for the $$$. Not an easy act that - one cd say a high wire circus act even! That's what Citizens United buys you. You can either have capable people, running b/c they think it's the right thing to do with their time, or you can have bought-and-sold puppets shivering whichever way the wind blows, forever seeking re-election and approval from both sides. Based on merit the best democracy money can buy is not.<br>
Or rather - selects for the merits all right, but for the wrong merits, for bad traits, in your political class. Buying influence works for you short term in narrow sense, but is bad for yourself too (as is for all Americans) long term and in wider sense. This 2c from a foreign observer rando 1000s of miles distant and with no special knowledge of the US politics.<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
Very good. The list of things they consider is long almost exhaustive. Most of the points have already been made, some by other people too (if you follow these things). While nothing there earth-shattering, it's good to see it all nicely laid out and reasoned about.<br>
However. The report is thin on recommendations "What is to be done now?", or did I miss them really!? That really surprises me.<br>
If I were to "what ought to be done" in two sentences: UK central gov is ultra centralized in Whitehall (#1) (almost Stalinist in that respect), and then that centralized power is further held in a strangle hold by the Treasury Brain - Deep State - OBR complex (#2). So together they are like Centralization^2.<br>
Atm that ensures - #1 nothing can be done by anyone else, and #2 they've settled on "do nothing" b/c everything costs money, and #2 care disproportionally more about that cost, and much less about what capability assets etc that cost buys UK. Once nothing tangible is done, laziness is naturally encouraged, activity punished, and every promotion every jostling in the hierarchy becomes entirely a beauty contest, divorced from any real-word results. All this seen afar by outsider without any insider knowledge. Just listening to @RoryStewartUK and @Dominic2306 relying info about the inner workings of UK gov machine.<br>
So any intervention wd have to come (walking backwards) into choke point #2, and or at choke point #1.<br>
Choke point #2 means smashing the power of the Treasury. They are good servant, but a bad master, currently. No.10 (the PM) needs to re-assert itself over and above No.11 (the FinMin) by 1st-ly taking decision powers out of No.11 hands. No.10 would have to work much more on getting things done, take interest in that, and leave behind the media PR Circus it's totally devoted to atm. Just assume you will serve 1 term (or less!), drop the "permanent electioneering mode" (that nowadays the position goes into while in gov), don't think of re-election and try get stuff done, assuming you've run out of time. Can't see how a change like that can come but directly from the top, from the PM. Supported by legislation and votes to dismantle the 1000 roadblocks, via the political power of MPs voting in Parliament.<br>
Choke point #1 means decentralization of power. UK used to have vigorous local authorities that could innovate in various ways. Admired once at the riches of local gov building in Birmingham. The idea that some pimply fresh graduate 20yo SpAd 120 miles away in London would be telling these people how many pencils they should buy I presume would have struck people running the City gov absurd, like a Monty Python sketch to us.<br>
Mid-term UK needs to build another 10mil strong cities agglomeration, e.g. Liverpool - Manchester - Leeds - Sheffield - Hull, by connecting them with transport links, and building housing along the links for commuting whichever way people fancy. Increased value of the land b/c commute/jobs will finance the buildup itself. With Birmingham half-way between this new MegaCity and the old London. So London gets some competition, and raises its game too. Atm feels no acc/London but coasting because TINA. London cd e.g. respond by completing the Golden triangle (London-Oxford-Cambridge).<br>
Ofc it's all good amusing ourselves with "what ought to". But power - decision making, financing - is out of the hands of the authors, and yours too. People that own UK, and run UK, don't come to us on X asking for advice. What can be done abt that is an entirely new can of worms, that the authors of the report cd maybe address in Part 2, in a sequel to the report. 😀<br>

Not only NYC/US, in UK it's similar. Laziness aided by the natural dynamics the exists against doing stuff: excuses "why not" are easy to come with & plentiful, "how to" is rare & requires hard work. Things go wrong when I do them, and then I get blamed for it! And I can't feel clever too, with all the fails & disasters. Better and easier to sit on my hands, pontificate wisely, warn of difficulties & disasters, and I will never be wrong.<br>

Pa koga Rusija ke pobedi, i posle koga Bugarija (poddrzana od taa ista Rusija! tie im se klienti #1, a Srbija #2, na balkanite) ke zeme vas da ve perdashi, ke kukate kalimerovski kako taa nesreka od nebo da padnala, nichim izazvana.

Google works everywhere all the time for me. Zoom has not worked well for me recently. The default Zoom controls have been wrong every time (no video! no audio!) and since my usage dropped, I have to spend 2 mins hunting in the GUI to set them right. (while the meeting has started) After I finish telling Zoom which video feed, microphone, speakers to use, it seems it doesn't remember it? Has to be told again next time? Plus - thought setting "default" at OS level  (Xubuntu) wd tell it what to use, but that has not consistently worked either.<br>

Just register an account on both. And actually on *all* platforms. Why not?

Even if for nothing else - but to reserve your favorite nickname login or even personal name?<br>
That way everyone can re-create their social graph Follows-Followers. Redundancy is the mother of robustness, of risk reduction. 😆 This is not an exercise in punishment, we are not here to inflict suffering on no one (not even EM). We users are to preserve our user autonomy, our agency. Not to be railroaded by one platform, whomever the owner maybe be, whatever ideas s/he may have and changes institute.<br>
The social graph Followers-Follows is what keeps us users locked in a social network. Not the posts. Posts are like flowing water, will be quickly re-created. Most posts are time-events-sensitive anyway, non transplantable. Once a social graph replica is in place, we users can switch posting to a new place much much easier. Or post same things on both. Or post different things, choose a platform most fitting the post. 😅 Something professional social media workers already do.<br>

Elmo was in full propagandist mode v.v. UK then, one man propaganda unit convincing millions of gullible americans and thrashing UK. Every "!!" and "concerning" forward of his I saw was forwarding a partial truth. And then someone else's 1st reply laid down the whole truth.<br>
Along the lines of - "Yes, sentenced to 1yr, and yes, he posted something on FB. But no, he was not convicted for that. The judge convicted for throwing bricks at the police & setting a police van on fire. That the accused admitted to. So yes - no trial, just sentencing, b/c the accused admitted to the charge."<br>

Nothing stopping anyone to create their user on any and all platforms out there. To reserve their favorite nickname if nothing else.

Worth watching' jibe to the alt-history of the "Churchill bad, Hitler/Nazis not so bad" type by the Man from the High Castle would do it for the CON-s in the end?? No signs so far. Possibly busy "(not) paying their expenses, snorting coke and sodomising each other".<br>
TBF "public Square N^2 iron law of network value" works against a UK switch. The value of the social network to us users lies in the interactions facilitated by the connections, and those grow with N^2 of us N.<br>
It's a very specific collective action problem. Social media natural monopoly network effect can only be circumvented by synchronization, moving *at the same time* by millions of users. The timeliness makes all the difference -  must be all at the same time. 1-by-1 Switcheroo is bound to fail. For Brazil users - the ban provided that sync. Ban that's now been lifted, I heard.<br>
Comparing X:Bsky=100:10 millions of real users (assuming big X bot ratio), ratio 10, squared 100. Do I see as much interesting stuff on X in 1 day, as I see in Bsky in 3 months? Possibly - for me maybe the ratio is lower, but ~2 months seems realistic for me.<br>
Given all the free time we have on our hands (evidenced by us writing this on X!), and given it's all free ($$$ wise), it's a mystery to me why doesn't every X user create a Bsky account. It's ok for it to stay inactive dormant. The "social graph" that is Followers-Follows is what keeps users locked in a social network. Not the posts. Posts are like a flowing water, are quickly re-created. And most posts are time-events-sensitive anyway, non transplantable in content. Once a social graph replica is in place, users just switching their posting to the new place is much much easier.<br>

Long tradition that, but progress still! The cost of change used to be "ostracized, thrown out of the profession and dying in a lunatics asylum" (https://perplexity.ai/search/what-was-the-name-of-the-hunga-81qTegFeRFuow.afa_6HiQ#0), but we have now moved in our times to "ignore as long as you can until overwhelming evidence" (https://perplexity.ai/search/what-was-the-name-of-the-austr-B2kpArvLSUOjyFO5496A4g). Plus in modern times we manage to recognize the achievement in their lifetimes and give them a Nobel. Better than driving them insane and destitute.<br>
It's a tough cookie, designing the system. On one hand, 99.9% of things newly proposed are wrong and or bad (with a lots of insane stuff there too). But advances and improvements can only come from the 0.1% that are against the consensus, and are right too!<br>
There are plenty of lunatics in the medical profession, as there are in any other profession (mine included) and the wider society too. That's why we have self-regulating professional bodies that regulate licensing and mandate standard treatments for  standard ills with almost military discipline and hierarchy. B/c left alone for any doctor to do as they think in their crazy head - that is a recipe for a billion disasters.<br>

...and the Feeds (posting them b/c lacking them on X, where only "For You" and "Following" exist, it's not easy to comprehend) look like on the pic below. I miss most on X "Mutuals", "FollowersLike", "Popular with Friends" and "Quiet Posters". The last one is esp good for improving the SNR of the TL. On the theory of "all people have about the same amount to say, those that speak less often, pack more in their one message". 😂<br>
One can create own Feed should one want to. There are two levels. Easy user level create is equivalent to a search query (on XPro equvalent wd be Column in a deck). The developer level is more involved not for the avg user like myself. More at https://perplexity.ai/search/feeds-on-bluesky-can-any-user-8AW4f3MEQQ2o3TNHYavqtQ#0<br>

CICO obv true but as much help as "just say NO" to sex, drugs, alcohol etc. Persistent +ve bias in regulation e.g. 1 apple surplus ≈ 90 kcal ≈ 10 gr fat/day x 365 days ≈ 3 kg fat/year x 10 years ≈ 30 kg extra in 10 yrs => obese. Most people takes them 20-30 yrs to become obese post-youth => error is 3 times less ≈ 30 kcal. Error of 30 kcal is 2% of daily average 1500 kcal. So a persistent +2% error in the neural circuit prediction of how much to use v.s how much to store results in obesity. Error in the other direction -2% wd likely result in death => can't happen.<br>

My Bsky https://bsky.app experience. The Feeds feature is a clear win over X. It's like having user-defined "For You" and "Following" feeds (that X lacks). There are like 10 versions of those with various tweaks (supplied by Bsky). On the other hand, going back to short/original length posts and having to chain long post  like this one as 1/ 2/ ... etc parts is annoying having now got used to longer X posts.<br>
The big thing is re-creating your social graph follows-followers. It's painful manual work, I could find like 1/5-th of the people here. Even when people register acc on Bsky, they will not be posting much there, so temper your expectation. 😑 The "Sky Follower Bridge" browser extension eases that chore by a factor of 100. It worked very very well. I did as described in https://wikihow.com/Import-Twitter-to-Bluesky . It looks like in the pic below in operation. Tips - bigger screen better, mouse scroll wheel speeds it up, can re-start from middle of accounts list, works too for members of Lists! (if you have them - I do)<br>

👍 Oh yeah, definitively!! I like (and contribute) to the Community Notes, it's truly "maths made good for common good", love that! 🥰 Think @VitalikButerin had a great explanation both about the idea ("people that disagree in the past on many issues, but agree on this one") as well as the math of the implementation (SVD - singular value decomposition of some matrix; TODO self - track down the exact model).<br>
Community Notes is something Bsky should defo think of implementing. Moderation only gets you so far, as: 1) it has got group think fail built in 2) doesn't scale, not easily scaled up to 1B (now) or 10B (tomorrow) or 100B posts per day (future; when bots agents contribute much more than us pple). Moderation has a positive that it's low latency. So it's not either-or - it's both.<br>

Didn't know about Counter Social - what's that?<br>
I tried Mastodon on the last X bustup. That's passable for a computer person, reminds me of earlier DIY Internet. But Mastodon will not do for normies - and neither do they aspire to. In comparison - Bsky is a much more polished product.<br>
But it doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things "which 2nd place", as long as one has "a 2nd place" to fallback to. B/c Bsky being owned by whomever today, tomorrow maybe owned by Musk, or Zuck, or the current owners may decide that want to be Media Moguls/Celebrities, get into politics turn it into their personal propaganda tool etc. Anything is possible.<br>
It's prudent for us users to have a copy of our social graph. The *social graph* is the stuff that matters! Especially considering registering to another site costs zero $$$. Only a bit of effort on us, users, in our idle time. Time we have a-plenty, given we're here on X, myself writing this. 😂😂<br>

Yep - "public Square N^2 iron law of network value". The network value to us N users increases with the square of N (increase), increases with with N^2, as the value is in the connections (that grow with N^2).<br>
Current users approx (assuming lots of X bots) millions X:Bsky=100:10 users, a ratio of 10, squared that's 100. I'm both on Bsky and X. What I see on X in 1 day in terms of value takes 100 days to see the same on Bsky (~ three months?). That's approx true in my experience.<br>
So one user switching is never going to work. Millions of users need to switch contemporaneously *at the same time*. Like Brazilians did by the force of circumstance. :-) Then the switch will work.<br>
Bsky experience - the Feeds feature is a clear win over X. It's like having user-defined "For You" and "Following" feeds (that X lacks). Going back to short/original length posts and having to chain long post  like this one as 1/ 2/ 3/ etc parts is annoying tbh. 😄<br>

I have no doubt that political machinations & power plays were played out, with no saints there. Just don't want Musk nor anyone else holding monopoly power over me. Social networks are a natural monopoly, what's true of Musk is true of Zuck & the rest.<br>
All power corrupts, absolute power corrupts absolutely. Musk has amassed a lot of power, by virtue of being competent, energetic, getting things done, being in the right place at the right time, lots of luck etc. Still - TINA is bad, alternatives and competition are good.<br>

Competition is great, lesson 112. 😆 Every one of us on X should<br>
1) open an account with Bsky - it's free ffs, you lose nothing! and<br>
2) re-create your social graph follows-followers; painful manual work, but at least one great AddOn exists (Sky Follower Bridge) that eases the chore by a factor of x100<br>
Switch over is hard and not completely desirable anyway. Don't want to replace one brute monopoly with another one! Social Square networks N^2 iron law of value ensures what one gets from X in 1 day, takes 1 about month on Bsky (currently). Any crossover will be slow.<br>
Everyone non-Musk should want to have alternative. Better for us - but better for Musk too! Even an angel 😇 will have their character corrupt sooner rather than latter by the daily adulation of millions of people!<br>
One can say - it's on him, he's the one pursuing a Media Mogul Celebrity combo for own fun and fame, and bought a megaphone 📣 for himself to get heard by millions. True that but still - it's affecting us, it's on us to seek avoiding being TINA cornered. Bsky is one such route out! Free, easy, fun even -  something new to try! exciting even! - and everyone should take the opportunity. 😃<br>

Any number of holes can be picked in that map, but then "culture" is sufficiently subjective, so to be "whatever is in the head of person of 1" (yourself), "at a moment in time". But then your knowledge and reasoning in the replies is just inadequate, weak, no rime nor reason. Someone gave the map the epithet "hitlerian", and after reading your replies - there seems to be some truth to that.<br>

Yes we can be respectful, but "don't have a clue" looks to me disrespectful. I respond in kind - tit-for-tat is a fine cooperative strategy actually.<br>
I didn't mean "repeatedly holidayed". I made a small slight of his trip, to make the point that ideologically Corbyn has been stuck in 1980s DDR, like in a ground hog day type time loop. He's still in his ideology as if 1990s and the collapse of the Communist ideology never happened. His wing of the party hasn't updated their views. We have had IT then Internet now AI revolutions. Our societies have changed beyond recognition in our lifetimes. Communism as imagined by Corbyn failed in reality at all times, in all geographies, and by varying cultures that have all tried it in some form. Maybe that's enough trying that particular idea. You bring Blair-Starmer as if I advocate for them. I don't. In addition to the communism and neoliberalism (that failed in GFC'08 and has been failing for the following 15yrs too!), there are other ideas out there, and even other ideologies! You don't have to chose one of these two - there is much much more out there. And all accessible nowadays - with everything online, incl people communities online - as never before.<br>

Another Nokia in  the making - what spectacle, darkly amusing. VW need a software person in charge. This is "software eating the world, manifest". They're making something that's more than a car as they know it. For the car part they have the knowledge - fine. Now they need a CEO that knows about the extra part that was not in yesterdays cars, but for sure is part of tomorrows cars. They need a CEO that has programmed himself, knows software development, and that can bring in a team with him that will replace existing heads (all to be fired asap) of departments and execute on a "software everywhere all the time" vision.<br>

I think candidates that you might have in mind maybe in short supply, even non-exhistant. I will not ask why don't you give it a try. Rory Stewart @RoryStewartUK and Dominic Cummings @Dominic2306 have given several long interviews, written a book and blog posts, about the problems of our political system, including the incentives, the calibre of people the system attracts, how it trains and funnels the intakes, the powers dynamics how ones up others down etc. If this is of interest to you - I'm ok to look them up.

Everything I assume - as there's an empty middle, a void where an idea should be. The idea "lie down and die" is spherically wrong and bad - so it's proponents can't advocate any aspect of it. So the "research" has to be a beauty contest of vaguely sounding value propositions by necessity. In a sane world, all funding agencies would defund all that from-valueless to-outright crazy activity and allocate resources elsewhere. The aspiring PolPots in the field can then do some self financing field work in the fields (corn, maze etc) putting in their own personal practice their insane ideas. I'm sure they - and by extension us - would learn much more with that "research".<br>

One of the motivations - yes, but other factors are at play too. To seek the impossible, to basically require real people to be angels, means to exclude everyone real. Even worse - who are the people that will think and or claim they are angels incarnates? Well - the lyers, the crazy, the deluded, the bullshitters that lack even the concept of truth. So a mechanism for negative selection that, a job advert "only angels need apply". Better - stay realistic and down to earth, accept the crooked timber of humanity, and trying to build with it the best you can.<br>

Where to start with what you wrote.<br>
I deduce that great suffering of UKR-s, like the annihilation of the intelligentsia after the 1920s, the  Holodomor and similar - just goes over your head. The current war that started in 2014 is fought on the side of RUS to 1) take over UKR 2) install puppet gov 3) ban UKR language and culture, extinguish them 4) murder those that resist 5) convert to Russians the rest. These are RUS war aims. Apparently - this literal genocide in the making (we see glimpses - what happens in the occupied lands, the children- some orphaned - shipped over to RUS to be converted into Russians) just does not touch your heart.<br>
I expect you to know who the "useful idiots", the "govnojeds" were, and what their role was 1945-1990. Do you? "Some people" are their 21c equivalents. What you are relaying to me comes from a single source: the Kremlin. It's not something you came up with yourself. You are relying to me what the "political technologists" as described well in "Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible" by Pomerantzev invented. You (rightly) notice the BBC propaganda. But then - Kremlin propaganda that's x1000 times the level of BBC - you just lap it up?? I must give it to people like Surkov: their stuff works. Not even so much to construct a single solid lie (the coup one maybe a rare example), but by "flooding the field with shit" to deny the possibility of any definite truth, and thus any possibility of objective reality.<br>
UKR was invaded b/c they are not members of NATO. Surely you can see with your own eyes: NATO members don't get invaded. If NATO membership had any influence, that's it: tragically UKR was not admitted in time, even after begging to be, and so they got invaded. The CEEu countries that are in NATO, got in after years of begging and lobbying. They were fully cognizant of the danger they were in with Russia on their borders. I wish US had role in the events as you describe. The CIA coup etc - another Kremlin story you just swallow whole. Even if we were to swallow the coup lie - don't you notice there were 2 election cycles afterwards, with different people getting elected?? How can anyone be so blind to reality. In reality, USA didn't help at all (except for the infamous cookies - ha! what help that), and even after UKR was invaded in the east, and Crimea taken away, US provided only minuscule and non-lethal aid. True to form, Germany past Feb-22 still was droning about providing - wait for it - "5000 helmets" as help. All that while previously shamefully UK admins ending with Obama made sure UKR was disarmed and left defenseless at the gentle mercies of Russia.<br>
I see that you have not read a single line of Putin's speeches translated for you on Kremlin dot ru, so I will spell it for you. Russia is not stopping any time soon. They sacrificed 500K, they can go on and do the same with the next 5M too. And if RUS wins in UKR, I can imagine them press-ganging  the Ukrainian army, together with Belarus army. Belarus that RUS takes over once Lukasenka dies, by maneuvering a more Kremlin accommodating ruler. So with UKR creating a union RUS+UKR+BLR - a NeoRussia if you like. Then use the combined force to invade first the Baltics, and then Poland.<br>
This is especially a risk if US and WEu are considered weak and unlikely to get involved by (Neo)Russia. And then it turns out - US and WEu *do* get involved, turns out Russia miscalculated there. In the case where US gets involved in a conventional war against Russia with boots on the ground, and esp in Poland - there I can see how that may end up in a nuclear disaster.<br>
So we are 1/4 of the way there. Would have been 1/2 there, had UKR fallen quickly. But - they may still fall, everything is in the balance. If RUS get to execute the plan (even if delayed - but hey, plans rarely pan out without hiccups), that will be a regional CEEu war. May become WW3 - "history does not repeat, but it rimes". May go nuclear.<br>
Afaics one possible way to cut short that particular road to hell, is for Ukraine to re/acquire a nuclear deterrent, in concert with Baltics & Poland that also need deterrence to forestall the incoming war. The "peace" and diplomacy you talk about is not as anodyne as you think: signalling weakness to Kremlin, it opens the door to further invasions and ultimately WW3. Kremlin respects strength, and takes any peace offering as a weakness. It's the logic of a mafia don.<br>
I don't expect you to agree or even internalize anything written above. Imo given how coarse your heart is to human suffering, you should turn away from politics, consider maybe philosophy, ask your self what a good life is, how to live one, examine you life and your choices and such stuff. Leave the politics aside, give it a rest.<br>

IDK, maybe they can't. Maybe opportunity opened only b/c Hizzbulah decided to use pagers? Maybe Hamas didn't make the same decision, so no opportunity existed there. Maybe Hizzbulah had centralised organised supply management, creating opportunity, while Hamas didn't. Nothing I said I think is "highly likely". Speculating idly 1000s of miles afar while not knowing a single fact on the ground is not "highly likely" anything. It's mental gymnastics that only brings us closer to knowing the truth of the matter a miniscule, a microscopic amount - possibly.<br>

... b/c Hezbollah in Lebanon that bought the pagers that Israel implanted explosives in via a front company run by Mosad, is a wholly different organization to Hamas in Gaza that didn't buy any pagers. Would be one lay man's explanation for this "mystery" that's not one at all.<br>

Thanks. I know of the fake Kremlin pic, I saw through it the moment I saw it. That's what growing up in socialism buys you, you can see the propaganda easily, took me some time to internalize that you in the West don't see it as quickly. That fake news by liberal propagandists (have you noticed in this thread that I am somewhat critical of them?) didn't influence me one bit.<br>
I have never ever read any manifestos. IK it's hard for politically engaged people to internalize this. But us unwashed masses find politics booring and stupid, not worth our time. I have better things, things I do want to do, with my life and with my time, that don't involve politics in any reasonable way.<br>
What influences me though is when he says "No to War!" Ok - Russia taking over Ukraine does fit that description, right? The moment Russia takes over Kyev, and installs a puppet government - the war ends. That was the (hidden, unsaid) hope many in the West had (abt half of Germany tbh). That Ukraine folds quickly and that's the end of it. Only, imo that's 21c "distant lands of which we know little" - it's not the end, but the beginning of something else.<br>
The "something else" is - Russia is not stopping any time soon. They sacrificed 500K, they can go on and do the same with the next 5M too. And if RUS wins in UKR, I can imagine them press-ganging  the Ukrainian army, together with Belarus army. Belarus that RUS takes over once Lukasenka dies, by maneuvering a more Kremlin accommodating ruler, and with UKR creating a union RUS+UKR+BLR - a NeoRussia if you like. Then use the combined force to invade first the Baltics, and then Poland. This is especially a risk if US and WEu are considered weak and unlikely to get involved by Russia. And then it turns out - US and WEu *do* get involved, turns out Russia miscalculated there. In the case where US gets involved in a conventional war against Russia with boots on the ground, and esp in Poland - there I can see how that may end up in a nuclear disaster.<br>

A sophist caught short in her sophism. 😂😂 A politician to be this reluctant to say publicly on TV something that will bring her few votes, while she'd throw almost anyone and anything else under the bus in a heart beat for an extra vote or two - yeah in my mind this looks suspect. Maybe not explicitly "in the know" about sources of fund (as many take great effort to "stay in the dark", not become "in the know", as plausible deniability is useful protection) - but having an inkling as the sources of some funds she relies on, yes - suspect.<br>

I'm not a critic of his - I'm even a potential voter. But no - for me, neither he, nor his wing of the party, have  updated their world views enough to win me over. Eastern Europeans are inclined to be suspicious, given their experience with the Western Left soft spot for the Soviet Union well past its sell by date. Too many "useful idiots" for too long, or as the soviets used to call them "govnojeds" (shit-eaters). Both figuratively in that they would just lap any and all insane propagandist takes, but also more literally, in that when they were given latest takes Soviet views on events, at get together opportunities in say a Soviet embassy, the ambassador would instruct the staff to prepare cheap food (=="shit food") only, and save on expense, as there was no great need to win over the already believers. Read that in some of the defector's books, don't recall where exactly. (wd dearly love to find out) Latest - Corbyn position hasn't improved with his stance on Ukraine, I'm loath to say.<br>

Sure, not disagreeing with that. I was just reflecting on Liberals going 100:0 all out for Boris. Amusingly - much of Boris appeal was down to the "state intervention" aspects of it. That BoJo realized ~0 of latter, the lazy and useless sh*t he was. And CON govs adopted few Corbyn policies latter by necessity anyways, and the sky didn't fall on us. So - now it's even more mysterious and irrational the Liberal total complete anti-Corbyn position. In my eyes at least.<br>

Nothing wrong with a visit. Wrong not to update your worldview after, even if high time wd have been after finding out abt Stalin crimes. Totally wrong not to update after the collapse of the socialist block. By now communism has been tried and it's failed in different time periods, different geographies, different cultures. Maybe it's time to give it a rest. There are other ideas with promising potentials too waiting to be explored. I was born and lived 30yrs in a socialist country not part of the eastern block (unaligned YU). I have hands on experience and some understanding of that system that's not from books one's read only.<br>

😆 Yeah, I can sympathize. Mine I have not experienced any cock-ups, they are competent. But not b/c of the IT system that helps them, on the contrary, despite it! Their IT "systems" - they are I presume forced to use instead of "just use Gmail" - are seemingly made to make their work and our lives very very difficult!! A time sink and pain to use, I presume spawn of some sh*t outsourcer only the state can procure. The 1st non-paper non-voice communication they had was one way SMS only (GP->me), and this was well past the time when everyone just used free email everywhere all the time. Now they've graduated to a peculiar cock-a-doodle system, where they send sms with a link, I open the link, am taken to a portal, with a semblance of Inbox there, can "send a message" there but strictly controlled how many character in it!! 😆 Not sure if I can send over a pic, and I think they can't reply there - but they have to send me back SMS, with a link for me to open... 😂😂<br>

You are right, but I think it's systemic, it's the system they have, the system would produce the same result with different people. Starts with the primaries. The politicians running for office get selected by the party members. The party members are unrepresentative of the public. Members are abnormally unnaturally interested in politics, they are freaks, compared to the wider public that finds politics boring and never takes much interest in. So the candidates in order to win in the primary, they need to appeal to the lunatic fringe of their party. Remarkable how after decades of repeated plays, they end up with 50:50 for voting yes:no, and then the voting block splits again balanced 25:25 in R:D blocks. Maybe once they start with extreme candidates, then most such candidate can capture is the entirety of his own party. Can't bring in non-voters, and even less appealing capable to sway opposite side voters over.<br>

Are you in a position to name the people? I'm thinking "the media" is less than 100 people. It'd be good to remove the shield of anonymity.

Sure Corbyn stuck in a 1980s time loop forever holidaying in the DDR didn't help his case. But still amazing how zero cases of spli(n)ters appeared in the liberals' wall, it was 100 BoJo, 0 Corbyn.

In your dreams. In reality no one much wants to hear your drivel. Only under a threat of hunger & homelessness you compel wage slaves to come in & laugh at your jokes. This is why FIRE is necessary - not for RE, but to retain ones personal freedom. Getting to "f*ck you money" level should be everyone's goal. Life is not that long, aim to spend it with people you value and like. If Guille is one of them - great, bully for you. Everyone else that are random strangers - better build defensive walls of assets to prevent psychos like him breaching into your life and making it unworthy of living.<br>

It's just professionals refusing to use in their professional life email, WhatsApp etc tools they quite happily use in their personal life. NHS bad IT yadda yadda. IMO they should FO the NHS processes and takes some risks. For no rewards - so will not happen, I know.  As you are finding out - unbelievably costly f*ckups, easily avoidable. Remind me of old socialist country HS. Impossible to remedy both by top intervention by higher ups, and by bottom up intervention by patients. Unfortunately - they only course of action available is to sack the GP and everyone involved. But with the shortage of personnel - doubtful that's an option even if the need were recognised. 😔 With my GP I can't have a normal 2-way email communication like I can with 8B other people on Earth in AD2024. Not possible - for ... reasons. To start with - I 'd like to see one Health Secretary head roll for poor performance - even once!<br>

Nah—US-EU Co-Co (Cooperation and Competition) is working well. The US is excelling at Development—great progress there! But Research—maybe not so much?

Nah - better leave it alone, you will do more harm than good trying to "regulate it". Leave it alone, b/c you simply don't know. The success of your creation after a lifetime of trying surprised you guys too. Why now, what did we do now that we didn't do 10yrs prior? You don't know. You know less than you think you know.

Taking stock and re-considering all previously written: we already have a currency "backed by" something. It's backed by all the goods & services the country produces, and the currency is a ticket to consuming the said production. So maybe better tackle to problem at the source? If the problem is bad politicians, let's fix that. In preference to putting roadblocks in the system to disable politicos we ourselves bring into power, b/c they are not responsible enough with the lever of power (that we give it to them). Maybe radical transparency in all thing us dot gov related is a way to improve there? And the currency "backed by all goods and services USofA Corp. produces" is fine.<br>

SORN is one of the rarer cases in law where one gets to break do law with inaction, with not doing anything. Where action is required to stay within the law. It strikes me a bad design, better avoided. With the current state of technology Reg tracking etc - maybe no longer necessary? Maybe SORN can be scrapped?<br>

IDK. An economic historian wd have to weigh in. Afaik US had plenty of economic crisis, and lasting much longer than 20c recessions, prior to the current Reserve Banks system. Usually big changes big reforms happen b/c of a crisis, of the current system at the time not working well. Decades latter, when the then new version N is exhausted in crisis not delivering, the 1st idea is to advocate for return to the previous version (N-1). The crisis of decades prior, the reasons why society switched from (N-1) to N in the 1st place, are usually forgotten. Yes - next version (N+1) is going to have elements of current version N, and of the prior version (N-1), probably combined in novel ways to suit better the current state of knowledge, technology, our current desires and aspirations (that are also somewhat different to the ones our ancestors had 100yrs ago). But how exactly and what form it will take - is TBD, is to emerge and grow mostly organically by trial & error.<br>

... that's true, but it doesn't throw as much shade on us as it might seem at 1st, b/c it's true for most peoples anyplace most of the time. 😆 Imagine the "average us", then consider that half of us are worse than that. 😁 What's to be done, in addition to suffer our fools (that we can't escape)? Democracy is the worst system except for all others tried, that are even worse. Think most bang for buck wd be improving the political system. Atm it seems it works to extract the worst of our politicians. While a good system wd work to extract the best of the people that join. The behind the curtains book by @RoryStewartUK is good in describing the current state of the political system. Him and @Dominic2306 (yes that guy, I'm aware not the most popular and likeable one, but heed the message never mind the messanger) have dozen of interviews on YT on this topic of reform to the political system.<br>

Markets are a great invention, and have brought a lot of prosperity to humanity. Generally, like with other things where freedom is one of the axis if consideration - the freer the better. However, as with other powerful technologies, there is the "good servant, but a bad master" aspect of it: we want to be running them, them working for us, not us working for them, them running us. We have to be smarter that way. Notice where we can't use markets - like where there are natural monopolies - oft we also have trouble organising things to work well. It's not like anyone knows the secret of running things well.<br>

IDK. You seem to think that needing more dollars for a loaf of bread today than in 1924 is making your life tough. You don't think if the that ratio was the same today as was in 1924, you would be getting many less dollars per hour of work you put to earn those dollars? I think you would. You are looking at 1/2 (cost) of the full picture, ignoring the other 1/2 (esrnings), and drawing conclusions.<br>

The only invariant is time. The number on the tokens is irrelevant. It matters how much of your time you spend working for the goods and services. A reduction of value i.e. goods and services acquired per unit of time would be real reduction in living standards. Do Americans today live worse lives than their equivalents in 1924? I don't think so. Everyone agrees Americans living in year 2024 are far far better off and more prosperous then their compatriots in 1924 afaik.<br>

The number of $$$ you earn per hour of work has gone up enormously too. So per unit of time - the thing that really matters, as we have a fixed number allotted - there is tremendous improvement.<br>
Sure CPI measures the price of a loaf of bread in USD, and it does measure and increase in price in USD of the loaf of bread. That's 1/2 of the picture. The other 1/2 - that you are missing - is that you also get many more USD per hour of your effort.<br>

Hm - "can't feel pain" and "happiness" are not the same. Wealth means "I will not die of hunger and exposure while homeless" at the very minimum. That's plenty better than most people have it! Most of us have to sell our labour and time for food and shelter. Think the above is PR. I doubt that a wealthy person exists that doesn't know or feel the above. Fighting tooth and nail to preserve our wealth (as we do) is a sort of "revealed preference" type knowledge that we are all cognisant of the basic facts of life.<br>

"Money concrete" - IDK who demands this tbh. People I know I think can internalise that almost all their money are electronic. (all except cash bankotes) As in - yours and mine BoA dollars in our BoA checking accounts are numbers in a spreadsheet BoA controls (==it can change numbers up/down; while we can't). I admit there is significant portion of the population where the above not only blows their minds, 🤯 but they will bash my head crack open and spill my brains on the pavement should I ever try explain that.

😊 Ofc didn't "100% leave alone", no such thing exists. Plus e.g. ordo-liberalism variant in DE specifically provided state "ring of protection" around the market. In my defense - this is twitter, 😏 not enough space-time for nuance. 😂 IDK how exactly things will pan out. The most I can think is general - "doesn't repeat exactly, but it rimes". Information age brings much better feedback loop for the state too. Micro level - with a CitizenApp on the phone, I can think of examples where gov can succeed now where it was failing before. Macro level - energy transition de-carbonization requires gargantuan capital investment on horizons o decades. Not something private capital can do really. So the state will re-assert there - Industrial Policy Next Generation. AI in humanoid robotics - may require similar marshaling of resources? IDK. If every capital owner was another Elon Musk, then I'd see much less reason for it. However - most capital owners are pretty useless. Just sitting on their hands, doing nothing much. That doesn't cut it any more.<br>

It's a mixed bag. On one hand, yes, the USD has devalued relative to gold, but it hasn’t lost its value when measured against the goods and services it buys—where US wealth, in USD terms, is at an all-time high. On the other hand, there’s the argument that governments without external constraints tend not to act responsibly. In the past, the gold standard provided a hard-currency constraint; after the 1980s neoliberal revolution, control of central banks was taken from politicians and handed to technocrats.<br>
When you look at the current state of political leadership—especially in the US, where frontline politics is practically a circus—and then consider how back-of-house "treasury brain" has been running the UK into the ground for the last 20 years, it raises a question: is it wise for politicians to wield this much power?<br>
As for the idea of using energy as currency—it might actually have potential? If we tie energy to information in a "Maxwell’s demon" sort of way, particularly in the Information Age, there’s maybe something worth pondering there.<br>

Well - changes that big always happen b/c of a crisis. They don't happen without a crisis, without it there is not big enough coalition to support radical change in good times. My understanding is that the previous system that came out of the WW2 settlement worked in the US 1945-1975. Then the oil chock and the inflation were a moment of crisis. Similar in the UK - the pre-1980-s crisis of inflation, high unemployment, industrial gave popular support to changes to the post-WW2 settlement that we recognize as neoliberalism introduction into the UK.<br>

Excellent insight into aspect of WFH economics that mostly escape us. Meat to the opponents of gov intervention: apparently state tax breaks are a big factor in RTO. Makes sense - need to have an Office presence in order to harness the tax break!<br>
Very much divorced from an ideological PoV discussion that may go sth like this.<br>
Employees agree on temporary restriction on their freedom of movement 9-17 in a free exchange. That is a decrease of their freedom all right. But they take it, b/c it improves on the previous state of freedom - the freedom to die for lack of food and shelter.<br>
Can see how exchanging freedom for unfreedom may confuse a libertarian. It's b/c survival is something every living thing places higher on the list of priorities than freedom. An ideologue can't see this. :-) So the employee is choosing the smaller bad. Hence "wage slaves" for the condition, and "f*ck off money" when one can stop being a wage slave and is free again.<br>
Re: WFH and employers, why they would not favour it themselves where it most likely raises productivity and makes everyone better off?? We may want to look previous similar episodes in history.<br>
Q: Child labour - did the employers self-regulate and agree on voluntary code of conduct to not hire under-18s? A: No.<br>
Q: Slavery abolition - were employers instrumental and supporting abolition, and in conflict with the slave owners? A: No.<br>

Well - the 10+yrs CON policies delivered the ATH energy bills, that much we know. TBS what LAB deliver. But to claim to know the future is tad presumptuous. You are a CON - why didn't the CON side deliver low energy bills, if you knew the hows and the whys etc on this?<br>

Typically the doers know the stuff they are doing. OP traded macro -e.g. gov bonds, I presume currencies - and survived and made his $$$ money. That's a good indicator that whatever ideas he had about his stuff - it's likely they are correct, right. Financial markets are very fast to pass judgement on your bets, and wrong ideas abt the real world are quickly punished, separated from their $$$. Businessman like Thiel didn't earn their fortunes trading macro. So while they are right about other things, on the "US bankrupt hyperinflation" - they are wrong. @balajis<br>
 Was wrong and lost 1M bet - kudos for putting his $$$ where his mouth was. @jack<br>
 Forecast hyperinflation 3yrs ago, that forecast was wrong. Forecasting and them never going back to check - what happened? - strikes me as unserious. Entertainment, circus, media macro, clowning Cramer-style - but not genuine bet on the future.<br>

Neoliberalism was a big return to the market left alone - and that's failing now. No shame in that - worked for few decades, what works will keep being done, and finally will be overdone. We are at that stage now. Things need to change now in order for them to stay the same. The underlying principles of the free markets will continue to be harnessed, but in somewhat different forms. Cheer up! 😁<br>

Reform is 50 years overdue how research is conducted and published. Current system uses trust as "solution" for too many things. That worked when scientists were "gentleman with means" communicating letters to each other in Latin in 18th Century Europe. Doesn't work when it's a collosal industry in much advanced 21st Century civilization that relies on science and technology abt 1e6 times more than predecessors ever did. We need all components of the science process revamped and improved. Not much there fit for purpose afaics. I'd dearly like to learn of an organisation or movement interested in this.

If the power balance was about comparable - then yes. Buy we don't live in such world. The power emolyeers have is far greater than the other side. Absent unions to collectively even the scales - only the state remains. Individual employee has almost zero power against his emplyeer. That liberal-ish and libertarian ideologies fail to notice that reality (and maybe address it, come up with some mechanisms less blunt to present ones) is a major fail.<br>

New user experience is horrific. What they get is the blandest, worst version of X. Of 4 people I made signup -  0 tried X the 2nd time. Easy win to improve: don't start them with 0 Following! Why oh why would you do that?? Takes significant effort to find interesting people. Lift that burden off the newbies! Have starter packs, possibly thematic, of 1K - 2K interesting/prolific/etc accounts, and start a new user with one of those. Make it opt-out if you must. User A interested in Arts & Culture? Here is a default pack of 2K accounts, you are following them now - and click here if you want to unfollow them all. Or you can offer multiple packs - pack Arts 500 acc, pack Tech 500 acc, pack Sci 500, pack Film... (you get the idea), pre-Add the new user to all packs, allow the user to click to un-Add themselves off a pack. On the other side - you can offer some brownie points or goodies to accounts that volunteer to be signed to Follow new user accounts. Could match them by theme (e.g. Science & Technology). Starting with 0 Following, 0 Followers - is a downer, is dispiriting. You can do much better than that! Do it.<br>

Agreed CONREF win and NF as PM wd be v.bad. NF shares all the fails of the current politicos, but adds a sinister twist. When  buffoons cosplaying clowns take over, they have neither the interest nor the ability to exercise the state power to solve problems. Instead, and almost by instinct rather than explicit plan, they find a wound in the body public and drill into it relentlessly until the public screams in agony. Once the public becomes numb from exhaustion, they move on to the next wound and repeat the process. So a series of crisis are started, each new one displacing the previous, with no solution in sight for any of them. Like CON-s stopped processing asylum so to balloon the size of the numbers (and line the pockets of some of their mates) and get a crisis - but x10 - x100 times that. Maybe @Dominic2306 can find cobble CON coalition strong enough to try for a change? (and ward off REF) Can't imagine a new startup party to emerge in FPTP.<br>

Yes, the big divides of our time ares sane-smart v.s. insane-stupid. The splits exist on both sides.<br>
Current notable difference is the how respective elite-base relationship is played. REP side - the elite indulges the base, eggs them riles them up with ever crazier fantasies. DEM side - elite still resists the craziest fringe (while surrendered to the slightly less crazy) of their base, have not completely surrendered (yet?) to the worst base instincts.<br>
One rarely acknowledged root of crazy progressive on the DEM side I trace back to health-beauty soul-body complex a-la Elle Macpherson. Contemporary incarnation flogging "scented vaginal farts" cosmetics or some such. 😂 Mistaking beauty for truth is not unheard of. The Devil is slick, good looking and smooth talking after all. 😆<br>

Exactly - you don't understand. Events surprise you. This is b/c the model of the world you have in your head is incorrect. Yes we are replaying WW2 start, so far 1/4 of it: 1/2 b/c only Russia is trying to take over its "historic lands" (while Germany stayed put this time), times 1/2 b/c Russia did not manage to take over Ukraine. So 1/4 25% there on the road to WW3. If you read Putin's speeches (published translated) you will be less surprised. After taking over UKR, the death of Lukashenka, the change of power there is to be used to maneuver a pro-RUS leader in power, with the task of uniting BLR with RUS. Then neo-Russia consisting of RUS+UKR+BLR can look towards taking over the Baltics, and then over to Finland and Poland. The nuclear danger is that at that point a regional CEEu war becomes WW3, with the potential of going nuclear. The "rimes" part of the "history does not repeat" (exactly).<br>
For your benefit here is an article with the correct frame of reference. Notice how they are not only not surprised, but they manage to predict the future! Not a small feat that. Published 2 weeks before the current invasion, explaining more on UKR, the logic of RUS etc -<br>
https://kyivpost.com/article/opinion/op-ed/the-folly-and-lessons-of-appeasement-revisited.html<br>
Guessing the future correctly (i.e. not surprised - unlike yourself) gives some confidence that their frame of reference is correct.<br>
IDK you personally, but headstrong pple like yourself have strong egos. I ack the above is unlikely to change your mind. Written for the benefit of other readers. And for my amusement abt how anyone so steeped in Scottish politics can miss the parallels Russia-Ukraine v.v. England-Scotland and be wrong and surprised.<br>

"Spent 600M" view of afn is just stoopid - yeah spent 600M, to acquire asset worth 600M, so net wealth change of gov position is - zero exactly. Afn does not strike me as a financially illiterate -  on the contrary - so I put his post to just reflexive trolling. Begs the Q: if financially net 0 then why do it? A: Control. To take back control. Part of a wider point: UK privatized utilities delivered bills at ATH, additionally England privatized water co-s filled English rivers full of sh*t.

It takes a lot of mis-education to overwhelm the common senses we are all endowed with. In natural sciences natural instincts we start with are shown lacking and bettered. Not to say they are useless - no perfect final theory exists, it's always "the new theory reduces the error over the previous, but we never reach error 0". In social sciences a lot of "over and above" those natural instincts (like - love, compassion, trust, community, help each other) turn out to be unadulterated nonsense that hurt us all in the mid do long run. I don't blame the IYI for the fails so much. As it's tough to seek truth when no objective reality exists to show you your errors. I do blame them for the arrogance and lacking vigilance, self doubt, reigning their egos, specifically b/c not easily observable reality to correct them is available to social sciences.<br>

Not really as you could move mortgage, or sell and buy again, too. For the 1st 25 yrs the two options are pretty similar. It's what happens after 25yrs with the mortgage paid off: in one case you own a very valuable asset (that you can live in too, rent free). In the other case you own nothing, value owned is 0. Yes, while renting, you could invest in the prior 25 years in parallel into assets that will take you to equivalent wealth in owning an asset after 25yrs, only: 1) most people don't, lack the knowledge and the discipline; 2) there is always the risk that when you need it (in 25yrs from now), the asset class will be in drawdown of some sort, to your disadvantage. In contrast, a house in addition of being a financial asset, is also a real asset too, you can simply live in it, does that job. Yes, you pay for this reduced risk, via the rate of return on a house as financial asset being lower than other assets like stocks and shares. Still, most of us have one life, it's game over if we end up destitute. So reducing that risk to almost 0 is going to be costly, but imo worth it.<br>

He’ll likely succeed on a micro level, but at the macro level, I believe a businessman’s skills are the wrong preparation for governing, and EM is likely to fail. Running a country is not the same as running a company, and in fact, the two require almost mirror-image skills. Governments handle all the things that businesses can't or shouldn’t—like law and order, social welfare, and keeping the peace.<br>
In business, you can synchronize large groups of people through employment, knowing that if they don’t follow the agreed plan, they’ll lose their jobs and risk hunger or homelessness. But managing a country is different—you're dealing with exponentially larger groups of people, and you don’t have that same leverage. You can’t simply fire citizens who don't cooperate, and they won't be driven by fear of going hungry.<br>
The reason EM can fire workers during the day and not worry about them coming back at night to burn his house down is because of the state. Law, order, the monopoly on violence, and yes, someone else making sure those workers have food, shelter, and a reason to live.<br>
Maybe it’s time to reimagine a Nation State 4.0—new ways to handle old problems—but basic state functionality, inefficient as it may be, has to come from somewhere. You likely understand this better than most.<br>
I oft goad online outspoken libertarians to try for a startup libertarian state. I’d love to be proven wrong, but my suspicion is it would fail. A single organizing principle like “freedom” might sound great in theory, but in practice, it’s unlikely to be enough. Freedom is important—crucial even—but it’s not the only thing that matters. In that sense, libertarians remind me of communists, reducing complex societal needs to a single principle. And looking at the ideological voices surrounding EM, I don’t see much wisdom there.<br>
If it fails, the fallback could be the idea of a country-as-business—dialed up to 11. That’s not a new idea; in fact, it’s how unchecked kings ruled in the past, and worse still, it’s the kind of thinking that brought us Stalin.<br>

You would have to point to specific person or work. Otherwise - ofc you can find someone missing something. I have read Mosler and Kelton, and they defo don't miss that. Even more - e.g. Kelton on page 1 or sth (can't be bothered to go get the book rn) immediately is "inflation is the real constraint, real resources are real constraints, lacking pounds is a fake constraint - a displacement activity we busy ourselves with for little gain". It's pretty in your face explicit. There are better criticisms like "well if we start planning real resources, will that not descend onto centrally planned economy" etc. TBF have yet to read a non-brain dead critique of their work. So I wouldn't feel too bad abt the OP.<br>

In the books you read- did you note how WW2 started with Germany and the Soviet Union dividing CEEurope countries between themselves and then serially inviding them? You have heard "history doesn't repeat but it rimes"? Well the "doesn't repeat" part is we are repeating 1/2 of it with Russia on war path of conquest of CEEurope countries, and then "rimes" part is when they finally will be confronted at some point, that WW3 may spiral into nuclear holocaust at that point.<br>

They are deeply unserious people. It's not quite right to say "lie all the time", when the concept of a "lie" stopped existing for them. Whatever PR enables one to get ahead on the day - that's what's done. Worse - it's not the person, it's the system that selects for (ultimatelly - us voters), and shapes towards, the outcomes we see. It's explained well by @RoryStewartUK in this interview (time code at 10'30").<br>

Ultimately it's down to us voters - to start with. As that's necessary, but not sufficient. There is more than that to change the political system. How exactly? - IDK tbh.<br>

Well - they do have a strategy, and they pursue it, with some success - wind! Wind is something that panned at scale and developed. However, that's only 1/2 of a solution. The other 1/2 is storage and is catching up lately it seems, but will take some time, even if it pans out. As every new technology - all this is expensive. More expensive than the prior tech - at least to start with. We all feel it in the electricity bills: renewables at ATH, and bills at ATH. Before you tell me about marginal pricing gas etc, let me assure you: I know abt all that, and am happy user of roof solar (+battery), am electrical engineer by training (albeit never worked as one; into computers from get go). None of that changes much about the basic fact of ATH prices for consumers and industry.<br>

... in the UK, the explicit child support a parent receives per child totals ~ £10K. If the value created by a child is £1M, then a fair price might be £1M—no? So, £10K vs. £1M—hmm? It strikes me that buying £1 of value for a price of 1p is maybe too good a deal for society, and too bad a deal for the parents. Perhaps it’s not “lavish,” but more like “woefully insufficient.” Given the financialization and commodification of everything else, maybe the chickens are coming home to roost on this issue as well?<br>

What? No. True that maybe individual doctor can't tell you much about your individual case. How could they, they barely have any diagnostics? My car has better continuous monitoring than my body. However, collectively, the whole medical-pharma complex, where they have worked out a solution for a particular problem, cure for a particular ailment, and your case fits the template - then they are very good at supplying you with the solution, fixing you where a fix is known to exist. Quantitatively the results (life expectancy chiefly) are hard to argue with.<br>

The article is specifically about the (federal) government budget deficits. Must say unlike most - I'm not freaked out by the deficits. As I understand gov deficit==private sector sufficit, surplus. So gov deficit equals more $$$ in the private sector pockets. And that feels like a great thing from my PoV! (I'm private sector) The limit is inflation. That thing can go on, until we get inflation. As we got inflation recently. (over there in the US, as well here in the UK)<br>

😅 I admire the commitment, but I fear, the idea "we're leaving X", is like communism. Works in theory, doesn't work in practice. 😂<br>
Largest single public square N^2 wins every time. The iron law of social anything. 😶<br>
It's expected and explained in (computer) networks: the number of connections ~N^2 grows with the square of the number of nodes ~N. And the value to us, users, lies in the interactions facilitated by those connections. And those connections accrue with the square of the user base. Between a larger (2N) and a smaller (N) public square, the larger one will provide as much value in a ~day as the smaller one in a ~week. Users will switch smaller->larger, increasing the difference, in a +ve feedback loop. Until approx only 1 remains standing.  Ultimately it's a winner takes all.<br>
Switching is a very specific collective action problem. Social media natural monopoly network effect can only be circumvented by synchronization, moving *at the same time* by millions of users. The timeliness makes all the difference - must be all at the same time. So Brazil user base may switch b/c the ban forces them to move at the same time. UK user base is unlikely to switch as there is no ban.<br>
There are no reasons to not create a Bsky account. It's easy and free - no? Just do  it. Comparing X:Bsky=100:10 millions of real users (assuming much bigger X bot ratio), ratio 10, squared makes it 100. Do I see as much interesting stuff on X in 1 day, as I see in Bsky in 3 months? Possibly. For me maybe the ratio of value is lower, but ~2 months seems realistic for me.<br>
Personally, I find my Twitter experience positive overall. I read about negative encounters (and have mocked EM - c.f. my posts), but I rarely see ugliness on my TL. I rely on Lists - Sci-ence, Tech-nology, Comp-uting, Bio-logy, Che-mistry... - to curate my feeds beyond just "For You" and "Followers". Lists help shape the timeline, maintain focus and good SNR. Additionally, I tie individual Lists to separate Decks on XPro, effectively creating personalized thematic websites.<br>
I find Bsky ok. The Feeds feature is much better than on X! It's not constrained to the 2 feeds ("For You" and "Followers") that X deigned to supply to us. Seems many can create different feeds, with dozen baselines provided by Bsky.  Pleasantly surprised to find deck.bsky for decks too. Transferring user listss is a chore though, finding the same people is hard. "Sky Follower Bridge" works well, but it's still weekends of manual work. Ofc, even if you find the same people, most post on X much more than on Bsky.<br>

"Clinton SUFFICIT" I wrote, sufficit is the opposite deficit, i.e. sufficit==surplus. You seem to think you disagree with me, while we demonstrably agree. 😇<br>
Reagan reference was a reference him saying (paraphrased) "voters don't care about deficits", which as a revealed preference is true. Revealed preference is when people say one thing, but do another thing, maybe even the opposite thing! The latter is the "revealed preference".<br>
Reagan not only had the insight, but also he acted on it. He didn't care about deficits, public debt ballooned during his terms. That did not hurt his electibility afaik. I'm guessing - the economy was doing fine. So again I think we agree, while I get the impression that you think we disagree. 😂<br>

Everything there is true afaik. I only begrudge DEMs one thing: they truly believe the "public debt" baloney, and genuinely try to reduce the deficit. Note crazy Clinton's 2000s sufficits on that graph! (bars below the horizontal line) As federal sufficit equals private deficit (by the literal definition - can't be anything else), the private sector suffers, and DEMs get punished in the elections. Wish they lied more about that and didn't take themselves seriously on that. Just do as their REP opponents do - pay lip service only (Regan was 101% right on that). They will not only do better in elections for themselves, but more importantly, the private sector will be better off.<br>

Things took of 1st in England UK then in the rest of Europe (West 1st) at about the same time people decided to cut off the heads of their kings. We can't know how much a cause, how much a consequence - but there's no doubt: we had kings for 1000s of years, things didn't improve much from a very very low baseline. Humanity was stuck for maybe 10K years until the 1800s.<br>

We can control either P-rice, or Q-auntity, but we can't centrally control both (P,Q). Rent control - freezing P - will result in the consequence of lowering Q - reducing supply. It has been tried many times, in different geographies, always with the same result. We need solutions - but that's a bad one. It will not give us the result we want. Can tell now - even before trying it.<br>

I agree—the list of missed opportunities keeps growing longer.<br>
Energy. Nuclear power could have been a cornerstone of Europe’s energy strategy, especially after France's early success. How is it that not all of the EU followed France's lead? Instead EU follows Germany - Germany!! with its historical 20th century record - phasing out existing nuclear power entirely. Baffling on multiple levels, not least leading to increased reliance on imported natural gas.<br>
Speaking of gas: fracking is another puzzle. Take Groningen in the Netherlands. NG extraction was maybe phased out for good reasons, but then - buying gas from elsewhere instead of developing own alternatives?? That’s plain crazy. Natural gas absolutely should be phased out, but "doing so" by simply shifting the dependency to imports? Defies logic.<br>
GMO. Genetically modified crops I believe marks a low point in EU science policy. For nearly 30 years, policy was driven by a reactionary mindset, a personified RFK-Trump anti-vax anti-gm anti-pasteurisation (!! latest) anti-everything crazy, driving policy for 500M people! Fears trumping reason, technological advancements stifled in the process that could have brought agricultural benefits.<br>
Computers, IT, Internet and now AI - similar story. Linux - that is1/2 of GNU/Linux OS - powering everything from the Internet to the Cloud, developed by Linus Torvalds, a Finn now living in the U.S. He probably couldn't do the same in Europe, no one would pay him wages for stuff he wanted to do (the Linux kernel). How large are the European countries science&technology R&D budgets again? Then, the World Wide Web itself (the HTML format, the HTTP protocol), was born at CERN, but is now synonymous with US Big Tech. And out of the four "godfathers of AI", all Europeans, three have left Europe for the Americas to actually get things done. The one who remains (Jürgen Schmidhuber), is still in Europe but notably not within the EU.<br>
The only possible silver lining I can see from Brexit (that I don't think it was necessary), is the UK detaching itself from some of the more irrational EU policies surrounding science, technology, and progress. I voted Remain, but if Brexit means the UK can chart its own path free from EU's crazy policies, it might be the one tangible benefit to emerge.<br>

... and forgot: Linux is also 1/2 of Android (the other 1/2, the user space, is not GNU), so there is Linus creation running 70% of the worlds smartphones. Ironically - no Nokia in that new world order... If there was irony personified abt the EU tech policy, this must be it.<br>

... tbf US-ex-Ca missed those too. It's CA that created them, not the whole of US. 🤩 Note that the Tech exodus from the "dysfunctional" SF and CA "hellholes" over to the sunny Miami FL has gone nowhere. Startups in Europe have support that equivalents in CA can only dream of, yet - no magic happens. 😶 Think pple underestimate how magical and unique SF/CA have been, and how unlikely the same to happen at different {place,time} it is. 😊<br>

You’re right about a few things, but there’s more you’re missing, guv. There’s a reason you can fire your workers during the day, and they don’t band together come back at night to torch your house with you in it—and that reason is the state. Law, order, monopoly on violence, and yes, someone else making sure these people are fed, housed, and have something to live for.<br>
If you start taking over state functions, you’re going to learn this the hard way. Sure, maybe it’s time to re-imagine a Nation State 4.0—new ways to handle old problems—but that basic state functionality, inefficient as it often is, still has to come from somewhere.<br>
We used to have kings that governed with the kind of unchecked power you seem to be alluding to, but we stopped doing that, and for good reasons. Having the power to “terminate” people (figuratively, of course) as you do in business gives you coordination. But at the level of the state? That’s Stalin territory, and we’ve moved past that. Fear-based rule doesn’t cut it anymore. It can be done of course, but we have  better options now, it would be silly to settle for that.<br>
Being a CEO in your fiefdom might feel like leadership, but being a politician—where you have no life-or-death control over your citizens? That’s a whole different ball game. The rules are tougher, the stakes are higher, and your authority is more fragile than you think.<br>

CO2 online I find this hack/protoype<br>
https://hackaday.com/2021/10/30/this-smart-watch-keeps-an-eye-on-ambient-co2-levels/<br>
Blood sugar sensors - tried once the 2 weeks wearable disposable (like a button) on the arm, reading is NFC beep, can confirm - they work well. Could see sugar levels rise and fall in sync with meals.<br>
Blood Pressure - have that on a Samsung Galaxy watch (bought for that), works fine. Re-calibration is asked for once a month (it expires), so there is checking/fallback to another device for that reason. I think it's a good scheme.<br>

They sacrificed 500K, they can go on and do the same with the next 5M too.<br>
Further, with US+WEu giving mixed signals to Putin Re: defending the Baltics - that may easily end in a disaster. Putin regime is in crisis, he's fighting for staying in power domestically, looks for a bold move new war to deflect. Given the previous meek response, decides to take one last gamble. At that point US realize for real that their system alliances may indeed crumble unless they intervene with boots on the ground. Hot war starts US-RU on european soil. CEEu will suffer enormously -  again.<br>

I meant - the debate referenced is fine, but not even 18 hour video, nor $100K stake, is conclusive. It's the opinion of 2 judges ultimatelly. Like the opinion of 100 physicists (or scientists). The foot and mouth leak mentioned in the article (in Surrey, England; close to where I lived at the time) was settled by investigation on the grounds of the institute where the leak happened. For the LL side - without access to WIH, can't be decided conclusively for LL in a way their oponents will accept. For the natural origin - without chain of transmission and evidence from animals (like with the other recent similar viruses), it can't be decided conclusively in a way the LL side will accept. We have balance of probabilities (that have probably shifted towards the LL side), but not a closure, unfortunately.<br>

Yeah - but I fear that maybe indicative. I think of similar - in scope ambitious applying to the entirety of society, in simplicity also similarly simple single idea - ideology that is communism. Also when challenged abt the poor performance of the communist states, the proponents commonly retorted "but that the capitalist states are sabotaging the communist states" (sanctions etc). The poor performance of the libertarian states (of which I'm ignorant, I don't know of any - but I trust you know) wd indicate they are weaker. So in the Darwinian inter-states competition they lose out. But why? That dove tails with the "parasite" jibe of the OP that set me off on this: maybe OP is simply ignorant of what makes a state tick? Hence me saying - have a bunch of libertarian B$llionaires finance a test.<br>

True that EU has been too much anti-business, pro-degrowth, pro-austere Saint Greta etc. However - not all of US created these companies. They are all in a specific new industry (IT, computers, now AI) in a specific geography (mostly California + Seattle). The cries of "... so we are living crazy San Francisco and California, decamping off to Miami Florida" we used to hear a lot have subsided lately. We don't hear much about the new Silicon Valley in downtown Miami. So it maybe that this is a very very localized thing, unlikely to be replicated not only not in Europe, but not replicate-able in any other geography in the US either!<br>

"Parasite" - was the word you used. It implied EU was the parasite here. Other pple might think: wait a sec, the state - all this other people built, that are not Apple, over a non-trivial period of time! - provides plenty of infrastructure to Apple. Apple uses all the infra, but contributes less then they should, less than anyone else. So - maybe Apple is the parasite here?<br>
I'm sympathetic to your argument. You can prove your point: create a libertarian startup state. That will test everyone's theories abt the world. Plenty of B$llionaire libertarians that would be inclined to test this - no? Just do it. What are you waiting for?<br>

I remember reading on whether successful and productive pple (artists, scientists) have 1) a higher hit rate; or 2) generate more hypothesis? (or both?) And I think the evidence was that it's mostly #2, churning sth like x10 times more hypothesis, trying out more things.<br>

On "the universe is discrete" - glad to hear as it indulges my prejudice too. 😃 One can do steps -<br>
1-universe is unknowable to us in the limit<br>
2-but we can model it, come up with ever better models, reduce the error<br>
3-our models our desciptions are like your symbolic sparse representations tuples (quality,quantity)<br>
4-then every new quality we add is a new dimension in our model space<br>
5-so our description is going to live in an Ndim space, with non-trivial N<br>
6-from the ratio of Nvolume of Nball/Ncube we know our N=3 world is misleading us<br>
7-with moderately high N, all the Nspace moves in the edges, no space remains in the middle, and every Npoint is an outlier; ergo<br>
8-there is no continuity, there is no "infinite number of steps/points when bisecting between two points" convenience we enjoy in continuous space (and where we are indulged with differentials)<br>
9-nope, the space is discrete and for every computation we'll have run the summations steps tediously one by one, no integrals now to save our beacon make things easy for us.<br>
With the proviso: we tend to assume us - and the universe too! we always have bit of a trouble separating one from the other 😄 - to be the latest-greatest machine we have invented at that point in time. And it this point it's computing information processing machines. (troll jibe in pic below)<br>
I accept that criticism, but don't think it a deal breaker. Don't see a contradiction. Information/theory is another layer to the layered cake that is our understanding of the world. There is no claim "this is the final theory" afaics, only: with this latest-greatest added on the top of our current understanding, our error our ignorance about the world is reduced (while still remaining unfathomably large). The "mechanical world" model did not make the words obsolete, the words didn't put the wheel out of action and so on.<br>
Thanks again for  the thoughtful interview - I enjoyed it much. 😊<br>

Fwiw I think you are completely right. To scale x10-x20 times - that's impossible within the justice system. There aren't enough judges, lawyers etc. So it will be extra-judicial. However, this is one if these things, where even if people understand at rational level, they can't accept it as something that will happen in the future. I lived through some upheavals. When bad things were happening for real, that wd have been completely unbelievable only a month ago, people cd not accept them. Even where they witnessed them. There is a scene in a book about WW2 when an emissary from Europe meets some US congressman and tells them about the concentrations camps, that he was personally in. The congressman replies "I am not saying that you are lying, but I can't believe what you are telling me". So you are right, but never the less, I think what you say will have no effect on anyone.<br>

They seems to be tad too stupid and evil for comfort given the remit given. However, in practical terms - not sure how much harm they can do on a mass scale? FDA on the other hand, steered by the one side mandate given by the laws of the country (is penalized badly if approves a bad medicine, but is not penalized at all if doesn't approve good medicines fast enough), probably statistically speaking is responsible for lots of preventable death and suffering.<br>

Yeah - before nation states, the more distant loyalties (once one goes beyond immediate then extended family, then the village or the town) were King and God (those were close to each other too). I remember an article or podcast about letters that soldiers from Germany wrote home before Germany existed as a unified country, while fighting some random European wars (don't recall which ones). There was no mention of loyalty to the country  or the nation. Just - family, then Kind and God.<br>

It's a very specific collective action problem. Social media natural monopoly network effect can only be circumvented by synchronization, moving *at the same time* by millions of users. The timeliness makes all the difference -  must be all at the same time.<br>
Comparing X:Bsky=100:5 millions of real users, ratio 20. Network value is in the connections, in the interactions, the value grows with N^2 with N number of users growing. Subjectively comparing X with Bsky, 400=20^2 seems too high. It'd imply that in terms of content value, I see on X in a day, as much as I see on Bsky in a year! However, it does feel like I see on X in a day as much interesting stuff that I see on Bsky maybe in couple of months. So all that move and tray Bsky - they will be back. Except for the Brazilians maybe. If they make a close enough group, interacting between themselves, they may stay. The s/w features are largely acceptable, that's not a deciding factor.<br>

Nukes deterrent home grown for CEEu is the only possible way out. Poland+Balts+Ukraine if feasible at this point, *must* develop their own if they want to live. It's a matter of national survival. Russia is not stopping any time soon. They sacrificed 500K, they can go on and in and do the same with 5M too. Nuclear deterrent is necessary now. Poland+Balts can't start developing one soon enough. If impoverished North Korea, or isolated South Africa, or poor and feeble Israel in the 1970-s could do it - for sure Poland+Balts should be able to pull it off, and quickly, in AD 2024.<br>

... apropos this: anyone know of a sure fire way for the sender of the message to be sure 100% that the message was delivered on the receiving end? Not talking about DM-s, talking about back-and-forth convo like this. My understanding of the Algofeed is there is no guarantee that this message will be presented into your or anyone's feed. The easy (only?) means of feedback for the receiver to acknowledge receipt is "Like", then the sender will get a notification - I presume? Not sure if this is 100% reliable. This veers into "conference style" conversation that is more Reddit mode of communication. The medium shapes the message for real, and the messages shape the ideas in our heads - I guess?<br>

Yeah, agreed, that's the biggest downside imo. Having to re-agree to what was already agreed is costly, subject to minority blackmails and so on. That's why I'm thinking - maybe delete one free law space if you want to add your law maybe lower cost, more economical.<br>

Amazingly well I though? 😆 I give FAANG my data, 50 cents worth of. In return I get unlimited audio video calls with family & friends across the globe, maps of the real physical world - the whole Earth(!), satellites showing me my position, 24/7 free access to the totality of human knowledge from the beginning of history - all books all songs all movies by any human that ever lived. 🤯 My gripe is that FAANG are using my data poorly. 😶 I give them my written outer life (gmail), inner life (log books), physical position (GPS), much what my eyes see (iPhotos). Yet they still think "he bought £10 flip flops yesterday => he's going to continue buying flip flops for the following month". 😱 We have already merged our lives with computers (and other machines before). My gripe is that the computers atm are dumb, dumb as nails. Plugging in here the most excellent @pmddomingos interview I saw yesterday https://youtube.com/watch?v=1lr2HosqrBE by @MLStreetTalk . 😊 Entertaining, informative and educational, 🤩 public service at its best. 🥰<br>

Good spot! Yes—constructing an alternate reality takes a lot of time, effort, and ultimately, money. In contrast, some form of truth is usually available to us by default, almost like a "natural state" or "low energy point," making it relatively cheap. That gives me hope, to be honest.<br>
Contemporary Russia's "virtual reality" construction is especially extreme, given how ambitious and elaborate it is, which makes it incredibly costly. There's a lot for them to misrepresent or cover up. Back in the day, we had to rely on KGB defector memoirs—though with years of delay—to piece things together. Now, we can turn to works like @peterpomeranzev<br>
’s "Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible", and leaked writings or emails from people like Surkov to get some insight into what’s going on.<br>

Now, he’s doubling down on that soft spot for UK riots (aka - "civil war is inevitable") with some alt-history takes on Churchill and WWII of the "Churchill bad, Hitler/Nazis not all bad" variety. I'm sure your viewers are waiting with a baited breath to learn more - maybe indulge them? 🤔<br>
I foresee UKtwitter potentially making a mad dash to Bsky by Monday. Social networks are a natural monopoly, but they can crumble if enough users switch at the same time—just ask EM contemporary but old media mogul Rupert Murdoch about MySpace. 😶<br>

It's like a rerun of the GFC '08 banks bust. Just as Greenspan couldn’t fathom how banks' owners would let them be run into the ground, we struggle to understand how Intel’s leadership could do the same. His model of the world made such a scenario impossible—any rational model would. But it happened, proving the model wrong. Likewise with Intel: we can't comprehend that the owners would allow it to be run into the ground.<br>
You’d think the first step would be firing the bean-counter CEO and hiring someone from Intel’s engineering ranks—an Intel equivalent of Lisa Su. There was a recent thread by @bismarckanlys<br>
, I think, about MBAs running U.S. companies into the ground (Boeing, Intel), but I didn’t see any solutions proposed. Off the top of my head: owners are directors, directors appoint the CEO, so the U.S. would need to become a significant owner to ensure a competent CEO is at the helm.<br>
Intel has missed out on ARM for iPhone, missed the GPU wave, and is halfway to losing data-center multi-core CPUs to AMD. That’s 2.5 out of 3 fails in my book. I guess they could still do worse if they missed all three? But yeah—no redeeming features at this point. The mobile x86 looked promising, but then AAPL’s Mx ARM crushed that too??<br>

There is cost associated with the risk, the risk of not having energy supplied 100% reliably when I need it. That cost is 0 when the supply is reliable. Ofc I'm against this extra cost being loaded onto me. Is there a reasonable person that would be in favor of getting less for the same price, or paying more to get less? I don't think anyone would favor that kind of deal. Ofc, from the other side, if I'm Octopus, that calculation is the opposite and my minus becomes their plus. 😂 Seems pretty straightforward to me, I see no mystery.<br>

I'd recommend you check Michael Levin's work and similar, all available online. :-)<br>

That's physically impossible. I understand this is not what you want to hear maybe. This is not only X but all social media (FB, TG, TikTok). This is how it works.<br>
X algofeed is moderated every second. There is not a moment that you don't get it. The algofeed is what serves you this post! The stats are as follows. You follow 5000 accounts. Each one writes 1 post a day = 5000 posts a day. You login to X, X algofeed serves 50 posts on one screen full. Check X 10 times per day = 500 posts X will show you daily. That is 500 out of possible 5000 to be shown, and 4500 to not be shown. X must decide which 500, out of 5000 possible, to show you. Any one post has probability 0.1 to be shown. You will see 1 post from 1 account once in 10 days. X algo is non-random and tilts towards factors like accounts interaction - engagement with posts {Like,Forward,Quote,Reply}, bio check, decayed by time half-life.<br>

For non-stupid person to experience stupid has to somehow scramble their thought processes - but then they'd fail to understand!

Heh - you're not doing it justice. A British story if there ever was one! 😆 ARM originally stood for Acorn RISC Machines, created by Acorn Computers. It’s the 16-bit spiritual successor of the 8-bit 6502, with a motto of "do more with less." In contrast, Intel’s approach was more "use brawn in preference to brain," or "just double that transistor count already!" AAPL had a stake in ARM (they used the ARM CPU in the Newton PDA) and at one point sold their stake, possibly staving off bankruptcy. Sophie Wilson, one of the original architects, later changed gender—another pioneering move. 😀 There’s a reunion video from 2 years ago: https://youtube.com/watch?v=v1L3doT9B1Q<br>
. Can’t find the YT video right now where Sophie explains how they went to the US to find a 16-bit CPU for the BBC B’s successor, only to say, "Well, no good choices here—guess we’ll have to make our own!" 😇 A flex if I’ve ever seen one. 😂<br>

On this solemn anniversary of World War II, we are reminded of the devastating consequences when power goes unchecked. Today, it seems that Russia and the USA believe they have the right to destroy other nations while expecting no resistance. But let me be clear—this will not stand. No people, regardless of their nation, will accept their own destruction lying down. This defies the very essence of humanity. Even the most oppressed, like North Koreans, desire the means to defend themselves. Nations like Israel and South Africa sought such capabilities out of necessity.<br>
If the world continues on its current path, we may see Ukrainians arm themselves with more than just conventional weapons in the near future. What is @JoeBiden thinking? And as for @JakeSullivan46—his approach seems beyond redemption. This is not just a Ukrainian or CEE issue—this is a global concern. Other nations will seek the same destructive power out of survival, not choice.<br>
It’s time for Russia to pull back its army and for the USA to provide Ukraine with the means to defend itself. We are witnessing a dangerous sleepwalking towards a potential global catastrophe, akin to "The Sleepwalkers" of the early 20th century. We've already had two world wars, both in Europe, both ignited in CEE. Do we really need a third? This time, it might not just be Europe that suffers—it could be the end for all of us.<br>

... a small fraction of me wills EM to indeed become "efficiency" tsar, for the amusement to the various absurd ways his ideas will get reality's kiss of death. (for - good ideas, wrong context) Then I remember there will be plenty of collateral damage and think "better not". Successful businessman being poor prep for a country leader is a genre of it's own. Short and sweet pamphlet I recall from the toh is Krugman's "Country is not a Business". Strikes me that business leader vv. political leader are almost mirror images: a businessman has the duress of destitution at his disposal to ultimately coordinate cooperation to great effect, while a politician has to charm and cajole and herd cats with great skill and cunning to achieve even very small steps.<br>

What works eventually gets overdone, and when that happens, change is needed. Policies that succeed can carry momentum for 30-40 years until they stop working, and a country requires a new direction. The key is recognizing when to adapt.<br>
In the 1970s, negotiating with organized labor reached its limits, and the solution was to side with capital. But now, in the 2020s, the dominance of capital has been overdone. For LAB to succeed, simply continuing the same approach won't work. Instead, the focus should shift to engaging with organized labor—unions, consumer groups, NHS consultants, and experts in transport, energy, and economics. Together, they can devise a practical plan for resource allocation, considering the existing constraints—be they fiscal, political, or demographic.
LAB could be in a stronger position to lead this change than CON, but perhaps with a fresh face at No. 11. This shift may become more feasible in a couple of years, after the likely failure of Austerity 2.0 and amid the mid-term political pressures. By then, the results of Bidenomics in the US might offer clearer evidence, making it easier to advocate for this new direction politically.

People suffering in places that have not reached "the end of history" yet, we are oft puzzled and think "Whyy?? Why make such bad choices given such plentiful opportunities?" Where "Bad" is for everyone incl the person making them. Imo the post below answers the "why" logically: because such is their nature, like in the scorpion and the frog Esop fable. As much as I'm not looking forward to agree with it - I see nothing else that better explains.<br>

They are helping the working class too tbh (in addition to chiding; not harassing though). Spending £££ on cigarettes is a very very bad idea. Cigarettes are very expensive. Zero benefit. All in all - good, there was always a paternalistic angle to LAB vv. workers, this is fine.<br>

Heh - ova sto napisa nema logika. Moderacija na socijalni mediumi nema vrska dali e nekoj politicki sistem demokratija, ili diktatura, ili feudalizam... Moderacija na platformata ima vo sekoja sekunda. Ne ziveete na Mars bre luge pa da ne ste slusnale? Sledis 5000 luge, sekoj od niv pisuva 1 poraka dnevno, koga ke se logiras na fid dobivas 50 poraki, i taka 10 pati dnevno = 500 poraki ke ti pokaze X denes. Od mozni 5000. Kako odlucuva X koi 500, od tie 5000 mozni, da ti gi pokaze? Pa taka sto ima algoritmic feed, i X odlucuva - ovie 500 ke gi vidis denes, a drugite 4500 nema da gi vidis. Ako sakas da gi vidis - treba sam da odis da gi baras i da gi vidis (ne ti gi krie X). Ova za vas novina e???<br>
Dopolnitelno - ima zakoni, vo sekoja zemja malku razlicni, sto smee da objavi, a sto ne smee. Vklucitelno i vo US. Ima i pritisoci pri izvrsuvanje na zakonite - od sudii, obviniteli, politicari, policii etc etc. Pak - nisto ne mi e cudno, ima li nekoj ova da ne go znae??
Dosega imaa pomala odgovornost (no ne i nula odgovornost! toa nikogas nemale), plarformite (X, FB, Tiktok, TG...) tvrdea: "Nie sme kako telefonska mreza, kako MK Telekom, samo prenesuvame poraki, ne sme odgovorni za sodrzinata. Ne sme nie kako Nova Makedonija da selektirame i objavuvame." Imase "Section 230" od eden zakon kade toa se regilirase i interpretirase, kolku se edno, kolku se drugo. E od vcera - malku se smeni. Se zategna zakonot, sudiive odlucija "e ako biras koi 10% poraki ke gi vidi korisnikot - si poveke izdavac, a pomalku telekom". Taka da - ke ima ekstra moderacija vo idnina.

Do you remember the dire warnings of industry to be decimated, staff fired and jobless, pub landlords selling off and closing en masse? Do you remember what happened next? Are you capable of basic learning, can you actually reflect, can you learn from experience at all, from something you experienced personally in your lifetime?? OMG I swear lemmings are more capable of learning than our political class. ffs<br>

IDK TBH - I just multiply with 0 character references by an anon X acc. Pay no attention. IDK personally RS of course, I just read his book. It's instructive to see how the system works. The CON party selection system (and LAB wd be similar), how it selects and filters, how it funnels and educates the intake, how it incentivizes what incentives are there, and so on. There isn't that much "behind the curtains" info about the systems of governing that influence our lives greatly daily. So there's the RS book. And you have DC blog linked in some of the replies. I know of the following on YT where the UK governance is mentioned or discussed by RS or DC:<br>
1. https://youtube.com/watch?v=DGhiTZMCc2g<br>
2. https://youtube.com/watch?v=3i7ym_Qh7BA<br>

5. https://youtube.com/watch?v=4N59ZAyLKwE<br>
Ofc these are all very political figures and issues, take nothing at face value. But it's not without merit, there is plenty of info and merit in finding out how things work imo.<br>

😊 It's not reality. It's ideas in your head how the world works, and then you create a TikTok to express those ideas. That's great! Then the rest of us watch it, and the same (or similar ideas) are created in out heads. Love that. 🥰 But it's not reality. Reality is unknown to us. However - you can test your ideas, your model of how reality works, by acting on your ideas. For example, if a consequence follows from some idea of yours, you could bet on it. Putting $$$ on the line, money where your mouth is, is important, it keeps people honest. There are plenty of people that say plenty of things, some of them they mean them, and some are not really what they think really. Then - when you win or lose, you will find out whether your model of reality, was correct in that aspect of reality, or not. And then you will move to test some other aspect, some other forecast how things are, and on and on. That's the scientific method. That's what the guy on the 30' video does. And that's how he earns his upkeep.<br>

I see with some friends/acquaintances: as we move past 55yo, the body starts declining, we realize we are mortal, and it's downhill from now. As if on cue - the world has gone to sh*t, nothing is right everything is wrong etc. And I'm thinking: hmm, the world is not that different from few years ago. But we are very different. It's sharpened in focus by the fact that the same guys have many reasons to be happy and content with how their lives have turned, and not that many reasons for dissatisfaction, objectively speaking. ofc ymmv<br>

(it's not .@RoryStewartUK it's .@Dominic2306) Whatever character or profession or community etc - that neither qualifies nor disqualifiers what's written as true or false automatically. Sure we all take into account who-why-whynow-whynot-...s when judging, but the primary thing when judging is - what's written, collaboration from multiple sources, logical fit in other things known and so on. The usual reasonable stuff. Nothing earth shattering.<br>

That's what you think in your head. Apparently Kemi does not think exactly the same. We are trying to discover what's true, and how much truth there is. Anonymity or publicity plays a role when deciding how much faith to allocate to whom. That's why both modes of public participation exist.<br>

Our models know more about ourselves than we ourselves know. In fact - I developed a nagging suspicion that that's a more general rule for many things: to learn about self, build a model of self, on the top of the self. Then study model and the self jointly - seek (self,model).<br>

😂 Baffled, eh? Easy - ego, a big ego. Every influencer is - "me, myself and I" by necessity, by selection. Ones lacking that -  they don't get invited to speak on the BBC and write about post fest on X. 🙃 Influencers are all different, but they all must have one thing in common in order to be influencing. 😆<br>

... to be clear: these are the same people. Only some people, living in villages, get ideas in their heads, ideas too big for their village, and then move to the big City. These people self-select. Ideas evolve in the big City - they mate, mutate, cross from one person's head into another's, and new ideas are created. That's what drives all progress, that's how life get better in cities and in villages. Great books on how ideas come to be are "How Innovation Works" and "The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves" by @mattwridley<br>

Agreed that the center is the center of gravity. However -  If the vast majority of population is made worse off, the center will thin out, there won't be enough people left in the center. And eventually one of the wings (left or right), swelled by the newly immiserated, will prevail.<br>

You shouldn't be. People with all sorts of ideas converge in cities, and in that great exchange of humongous mass of ideas, Civilization itself is born, it happens, and it lives there. Civilization only happens in cities. Not villages. It's great that no one is forced to move to a city. I don't live in a city myself. If you are repulsed by the ideas - sure, move away. No one is forcing you to go live in the big city. There is place for everyone - live and let live.<br>

😂😂 Time itself flows slower outside London. These days I go to London once a quarter - to check what the future brings. Going to a big city - one gets to see the future. B/c the future is forged in white heat of the critical mass of people super-concentrated in the centers of the world like London (and NYC, LA, Tokyo, mega-millions sized cities in east Asia that I don't even know from the toh). It's pretty mind blowing. 🤯<br>

... in a way I understand it's Mission Impossible for X. Say I follow 5K people, each producing 1 post a day. I login, am shown 50 posts, scroll 10 times = 500 posts slots a day. Now - every time I check, X has to decide, out of the 5000 posts available, which 500 to select and fill those 500 slots. Chance of seeing a post are 0.1, or in a more intuitive measure - I will see a post from you once in 10 days. That's the baseline. Now - I know that in the olden days, only meta-data was used to tilt those probabilities. If there was recent interaction (X,Y) that is {Like,Forward,Quote,Reply} between accounts X and Y, that would tilt the probabilities. The interaction factor wd have a half-life, the value wd drop in half in Z days (measuring time of interaction, to now). I thought EM idea when he bought Twitter was that he'll use "deep networks" (DNs - as LLM-s were then) to do bag of words (or more) content of posts analysis. So to improve the SNR. I imagine by now they at least use word2vec type to create words feature vectors in some relevant space. I take it processing everything through a Grok type engine is impossibly expensive atm.<br>

Yesss - the WHOLE 30 mins! 😨😱 Shock, horror! 😂<br>
No need to frame it either-or tiger - there's room for all, it can be both. Esp with pple like OP that are motivated.<br>
Your video - some I agree, some is "meh - so what", some I disagree.<br>
However - there is one big difference. The 30' video is by a guy who bet his livelihood and his life work on whether his ideas are right. So if he was very wrong - he'd be bankrupt and destitute. That that didn't happen, that's reality telling us, giving us feedback - he's not all wrong in his ideas, of how things work.<br>
In contrast - your TikTok derives income from engagement. So the ideas put forward maybe right, maybe wrong - but we can't know. They have not been tested by reality. The reason they exist is b/c enough people click on them. There are plenty things wrong and untrue that millions of people click on.<br>

Economy GDP == sum of all transactions. Transaction = two sides buyer and seller, exchanging two goods, one is always money, the other is goods or service. This animated explainer is the best I know of. The author - unlike academia and pundits - actually earns his living betting on his ideas about the economy. The fact that he puts food on his table (and more) means that his ideas can not be all wrong - they have been tested by reality.<br>
"How The Economic Machine Works" by Ray Dalio<br>
https://youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0<br>
Your intuition is right - taking money away from you shrinks the economy, does not grow it. Less money => less transactions (remember - money is one side in any transaction) => less GDP. That some educated people believe otherwise, simply means for smart people to believe wrong things, they have to be educated into that nonsense. It does happen sometimes, unfortunately.<br>

Well, I guess hinges on the definition of "explain". What does "explain" mean. I presume being a physicist he'd prefer an equation that fits on a white board. Most of us would too. But not all explanations are like that. There is no guarantee that we ever come up with explanation in that form. Further, AI systems are a "white box", we know absolutely everything about them to the last bit. Can hardly complain - "black box, boo". We could claim "we build them, therefore we understand them", flipping the "what I can't build I don't understand". I understand not entirely satisfactory. But as per the course - as we don't know how we work too, and yet we do work.<br>

I don't want anything dude. I'm not a party member. I'm not running for anything. I don't need anyone to like me or vote for me. I have only moderate interest in politics, and only some of the time. Most of the time I don't care. I don't want anything about any party in particular.<br>
I was just replying to the ill-thought message of the OP @AaronBastani<br>
 that seemed illogical to me, on the issue what and who is a Demos in a Demos-cracy. For sure party members do not a Demos make.<br>
Illogical and a-historical, as there were perfectly functioning political parties prior to 2014. Aaron should now better, and I'm sure he does know better, as he's quite good on podcasts that I enjoy listening from time to time.<br>
Yourself however - you are making my point for me. Like politicians that most crave power - should not be close to power, like yourself an exemplary super-engaged party member: you are fine doing leafleting, but otherwise to be kept away from the levers of power. (c.f. Lizzy experience)<br>

As clear and unambiguous experimental result as it can get in social sciences. 😂😂😂 The party members, which are self-selected fruitcakes with absurd interest in politics, not shared by the wider public, ofc selected leaders that were out of touch with 1) their MP-s - who are more in touch with the public than the party members, by the nature of their job and b/c they have to be elected (party members don't have to be elected by no-one - any crazy can join) 2) the electorate. Open primaries would be like opening the doors of Bedlam - as we can see from the spectacle that US primaries descend into every 4 years. Centrist bilge - maybe, but not a bad idea to keep the less sane away from the levers of power. What one crazy can break - hundred smart and industrious people struggle to fix.

Subscription replacing advertising business model reinforces that - no? Advertisers of old wanted to appeal to 100% of the audience. While as a writer if I capture "mine" 50% of the audience that's fine and probably the most I can get to subscribe to me anyways.<br>

Maybe - still, should then they stay forever, to the end of time? Maybe they introduced new technology, doing more with less people? Maybe their sales declined? Whatever it was - not adapting to the circumstances now, means even bigger change latter. I'm not sympathetic to high CEO salaries either.  I'm in favor of capping them by fiat, by law. NBA players have theirs capped and don't see the leagues struggling for talent or the game suffering in any other way. CEO-s could live on 1/10-th of their present compensation and be just fine.<br>

You don't become largest country in the world by having no land hunger. On the contrary - by being hungry for land, you become the largest country on Earth. It's logic - not Russophobia. By panEuropean you probably mean German-Russian - because no country in CEEurope trusts Russia. And for a good reason. Well - we have precedent for German-Russian cooperation, there's that.<br>

Well - the party members are not the Demos either for sure. So a leader chosen by MPs - who themselves are in turn chosen by that Demos - is indeed more democratic. Party members by virtue of being interested in politics are indeed wholly unrepresentative of the Demos.<br>

So to The Times you give the address "jsmith+thetimes@gmail.com". Then The times sends spam to jsmith+thetimes@gmail.com. In your Gmail, in the web interface, open the spam email you received (it will be addressed to "jsmith+thetimes@gmail.com"). Above the header, 5th or 6th icon from the left, there will be the "three dots" hamburger menu symbol. Click on it, a menu appears. On the menu, find "Filter messages like these", click on it. A new menu appears now, and you can fill it with the filtering criterion being "To jsmith+thetimes@gmail.com", and then decide what to do with it - you can select to have it moved to Spam folder.<br>

Vera - I like that you write and think, and please don't let this reply put you off either. However: 😆<br>
 - as a member of "pioneer" socialist youth (that we'd call "communist youth" in the UK), I assure you, I didn't become "communist youth" b/c of the pay differential between shop and warehouse workers (merely reaching year 5 of elementary school at age 12 did it for me) 🙃<br>
 - IF! ("... if prosocial") - money is many things, being an ancient technology with us for a long time, but surely the basic function is like cinema tickets allocating seats to bums: decides who gets what when, on a 1st come 1st served basis (no discrimination; except need to show a ticket). Yes we cd probably do better than we are doing atm, we cd probably afford food and shelter to pple even if they decide they don't work for it.<br>

Yes! - this too!! I remember being serially surprised reading Abstracts of studies about cities air quality, and relation to various health issues. Someone mentioned - to be expected given who's usually paying for the study - but I don't think so. One can fudge or tilt or spin a small difference - but the numbers were shockingly different. No statistics needed to spot the significance - those sorts of differences. The air quality seemed to have huge influence. Maybe b/c it's something invisible to us - out of sight, out of mind. IDK for sure - have not spent time on this, just remember skimming through a table of numbers, and thinking "this is non-trivial" more than once.<br>

Imo libertarianism is like the communism of the right. At some point - it detaches from reality. I'm trying to imagine the "muh free speech" dudes whose posts I keep reading, in a situation where foreign power has invaded US, and now they are coordinating artillery fire via ChatApp, destroying US cities. And we get kind of Groucho Marx skit in real-time—free speech on one hand, helping to level your own home on the other hand? Contemporary comparable cases I can think be "gays for Hamas", or "feminists for Taliban"? Can't say not funny tbh 🙃 when that absurd.<br>

The risk of humanity ending itself in a nuclear annihilation is ever present. May happen today, or tomorrow, or in a year from now, or never. The question is: will CEEu nukes increase that risk, or not? To me it seems:<br>
1) Compared to no-CEEu nukes, in a world where Russia is content to stay in their own borders - it would be an increase in risk, no doubt about that. And probably wholly unnecessary.<br>
However, we are not in that world. We are in a world where:<br>
2) Russia is hell bent on conquering Ukraine. And if it wins there, I can imagine press-ganging  the Ukrainian army, together with Belarus (that it takes over once Lukasenka dies), to invade first the Baltics, and then Poland. This is especially a risk if US and WEu are considered weak and unlikely to get involved (by Russia). And then it turns out - US and WEu do get involved, turns out Russia miscalculated there.<br>
In that case where US gets involved in a conventional war against Russia with boots on the ground, and esp in Poland - there I can see how that may end up with a nuclear disaster. So in that scenario CEEu nukes may actually decrease the risk: by deterring Russia to gamble on US+WEu being weak and invading the Baltics+Poland.<br>

Indeed UK declared war on 1-Sep-1939 to their great credit. However - they could not help Poland. That's my point. The biggest empire at that point - could not help Poland. As for US: for 2 years UK was in a war against Germany (Germany itself allied with, and helped by, the Soviet Union at that point), and US didn't enter the war. Germany occupied all of Europe incl France - and US was still neutral. So for the CEEurope countries - any possible help is thousands of miles and many years away. The 1st duty of a state is to protect its citizens. The Poles should demand of the Poland government to develop a credible nuclear deterrent.<br>

It will deter Russia. If Russia invades Poland, and Warsaw is about destroyed and the 4th dissolution of Poland is upon them - then yes, I'd expect them to nuke Moscow. Likewise - if some other power were to invade Russia and about to destroy Moscow - I expect Russia to launch a nuclear strike against the invader. I guess the lesson will then be: better not invade other countries.<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
Bingo! That's the correct answer. Even Paris or London will not risk nuclear annihilation for Warsaw. Was WW2 not lesson enough? CEEuropeans need critical mass of states. I'd count Bulgaria out for sure, Hungary not currently possible, Slovakia probably out too. Don't know about Romania. Baltics + Poland seem to be in the Russia crosshairs so most motivated and maybe most capable and organized to pull it off. And maybe Czechia will join them. But yeah - if North Korea, Israel, South Africa could develop their own deterrents while much poorer and smaller, then it's possible for CEEurope countries to do it too. I'm amazed noone is talking about that.<br>

Can't be bothered to click on incoherent contrarian "free speech" blather tbh. No-one is stopping Durov from speaking about anything, etc etc. Do better. Unherd from alternative has became as predictable and as uneventful as MSM tbh. Paul seem to be spending his £££ for little gain.<br>

Great of him to try, kudos to @elonmusk for putting his $$$ where his mouth is and betting big. Sorry - but that's the only way. All the reasoning and arguing - maybe this, maybe that - works in maths formal systems only. Where one can prove something does not exist - so don't search for it, it will be futile. Everything else, in science and technology, there is tons more trial and error that people ever care to admit. Further, for a range of things that we know work and we're using them (not only NNs - also various medicines' molecules) we don't have a good theory why that thing works at all. In a way that we would find "the theory" satisfactory (usually some symbolic expression).<br>

I presume you are talking about academia, or sell side, or media-macro. To start with it's intrinsically difficult -<br>

... and on the top of that there zero incentive to be right.<br>
The IR reference is to a story from @garyseconomics I heard on his podcast or interview where his professor (MSc? Oxford?) neither knew he's been getting his IR forecasts wrong for a decade, nor cared about that to record and keep track. Also there is - as a get out clause b/c the knowledge is so poor - to explicitly refuse to actually try forecast -<br>

But without forecasts there can be no good testing whether a model improves or not, whether one is better than the other.<br>
Imo it's a Mission Impossible to improve anything there. Only realistic way around is if new money comes in, starts a new department with an explicit aim to do better, and then grows that way to eventually replace the old failing schools of thought.<br>

I moved to Xubuntu LTS about 15 yrs ago, and the OS went out of the picture. I don't notice the OS. The GUI doesn't change, I don't need to re-learn anything. I only notice the apps. Once in 3-4-5 years I have to install new version b/c the old one is not supported anymore. It's possible to move to every other LTS version to minimize that (so skip one). Now I'm on 22.04, previously I was on 18.04 (skipped 20.04). Within a LTS version the apps are all updated and supported - there are no obvious gaping security holes. In the olden days gaming made this impossible for many people - but seems Steam solved that. Other reason I knew for staying away - was Excel, having complicated sheets. Nowdays, between Excel moving online into the cloud Office 365, and having backup Windows version (8-9-10) in VirtualBox - that's been solved too. Ubuntu (and Xubuntu as a consequence too) solved the issue of Linux drivers for good. Nowdays I'm more likely to have to chase find some driver for kids Windows computers, than it's to do it for myself for an Xubuntu box I use.<br>

Not at all - E2E does matter a lot. I think the xkcd says that things for privacy and security are both much simpler and much harder that we imagine. Harder - b/c there is no technical way to resist the political power (monopoly of violence) ultimately given agreed on by the group consensus. This is all about every one of us living in various, multiple, groups. If I were to live in a cave some where alone then no issues like the above wd arise (as single person - there's no communication neeed; that models dies off quickly as no reproduction for singles either 🙃).<br>

Love the picture, and love the talk. Don't see a contradiction tbh. Information/theory is another layer to the layered cake that is our understanding of the world. There is no claim "this is the final theory" afaics, only: with this latest-greatest added on the top of our current understanding, our error our ignorance about the world is reduced (while still remaining unfathomably large). The "mechanical world" model did not make the words obsolete, the words didn't put the wheel out of action and so on. 😊 Looks like 1500 years between the 4 model adds above?? Now that's depressing. While exciting to live in times when the 4th/latest layer is added - depressing to think it took so long?? There is not much in the information/theory that's over and above: approximate a joint p.d.f. distribution, cut a plane that is the observation, divide by scalar (that is the marginal p.d.f, at that point) to make it sum to 1 again, then work with that conditional p.d.f. that quantifies the unobserved quality of interest.<br>

I very much doubt that. But even if that was true - they wd want to keep the servers running, users networks intact, and still using TG. The agencies just want the keys to decrypt the conversations.

Yeah! Amusing to see number of accounts proclaiming "we maybe next" while not in the possession of anyone's keys hence "nah noone is coming for you, you have no secrets". Or a number of USians users of networks that have surrendered their keys long time ago "free speech"-ing about 😂😂😂 Spectacles abound<br>

I read someplace ages ago a proposal to replace all US federal taxes with 0.2% tax on every bank transfer of USD (I send you $100, you receive $99.8, the $0.2 is unavoidable tax). Asking GPT-s now I'm told that USD banking transactions total $1500T p.a. So 0.2% that's $3T so at most could replace only about half of the federal budget.<br>

Yes, it’s been bizarre to watch. Even when considering the uptick in existential risks like nuclear war—there’s a slight increase, sure. But there’s also an increased risk if we let Russia swallow Ukraine (old posts here: https://x.com/search?q=%28from%3Aljupc0%29+poland&src=typed_query&f=live). So, even if we put morality aside for a moment, it’s strategically foolish not to give Ukraine any and all help they ask for. Least we forget—they’re not asking for US or UK soldiers on the ground, for crying out loud.<br>
This feels especially relevant now, given the anniversaries of both the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact and Ukraine’s independence. I want to think that Ukraine timed their latest actions with this history in the backs of their minds—the badasses they are. :-)<br>
Fwiw I agree/d with https://mearsheimer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mearsheimer-Case-for-Ukrainian-Nuclear-Deterrent.pdf . It sure stood the test of time.<br>

Sure - one is to balance the risks, not unreasonable to choose the lesser of two risks. If EM had the power to control my O2 intake while I'm living on Mars and he's got my life in his hands - that'd be one thing. His company making good cars on Earth is a different thing. etc<br>

I realize batteries are still too expensive and currently suitable for only a few tasks like managing the intraday duck curve and grid frequency stability. However, prices are dropping rapidly, so it's worth seeing what happens next.<br>
Personally, I invested in rooftop solar and a battery system (costing around £10K), which saves me about £1K a year on my energy bills—roughly a 10% return on investment. I'm considering increasing my battery size from the current 5kWh to capture more energy and potentially benefit from variable electricity pricing.<br>
From what I can tell, the general public remains ill-informed on the topic, so they're unlikely to apply the right pressure. As a result, politicians will continue to do nothing, and bills will keep rising, regardless of who is in power.<br>

Thanks - I had to learn that too. 😄 Then onto the next step: why is it linked to the most expensive of the mix? And further, ALL - not just incremental add, but all - energy in the mix is priced at that one MAX price. 🙃 Is this a law of nature? Is this god's will? 😇 Nope - those same politicians decided that it's going to be like that. Can it be changed? Ofc it be changed by ultimately @Keir_Starmer<br>

We both, seemingly - grew in socialist countries (prior to 1990), learned to program on home computers where one gets to experience the whole stack, from Basic to assembler to hardware, are familiar with (Shannon) Information theory and its applications in computing. I wonder - maybe that's why it seems so clear and straight forward what he presents? But I don't have a good answer why this talk resonate so well with me tbh.<br>

Getting in the head of a crazy is futile as it's a random soup. Things will change there from day to day with little rime or reason. Maybe he's confused, maybe he's simply for- whatever his opponents are anti-. I had a relative that succumbed to mental illness sadly ultimately - but: witnessing his brain working in real-time was irreplaceable lesson that keeps giving.

Maybe so — I don't have extensive experience with R, having only used it on and off without really pushing its boundaries. Matlab, on the other hand, I’ve used extensively. It’s rock solid, especially with its matrix engine, which I’ve always found incredibly reliable. I just wish it were open source or free software.<br>
When it comes to Python’s numpy and pandas libraries, while they’re powerful tools, the fact that they’re not native parts of the language does show. They get the job done, but in an ideal world, we data people could have achieved more with a more integrated approach. Julia had potential but arrived too late, and relying on LLVM held it back from truly taking off.<br>

I see why physicists (and everyone else too) would want ML to be one neat closed form function, that can be written by hand on a whiteboard. But - and I am not a mathematician, haha 😂 - before or maybe in concert with searching for it, it's only fair to consider - does it exist? Maybe it does not exist? And all this searching thing is a waste of time. In analogy of how ML arose from CS and neuroscience people being mostly ignorant and or ignoring classical statistics (and esp frequentist stats) and just pushing forward with "whatever works" (c.f. Breiman's "Two Cultures").<br>

To govern is to choose. It's all choices, choices you make - nothing is preordained. Most people and esp the most affected ones are ever more aware. You were given a lot, a thumping majority - do something useful with it. Excuses will not do you much good for much longer.<br>

For me, at some level of abstraction - yes. I'm not the right person for this - as I don't understand what the big deal with conciseness is anyway. I don't expect if I'd drill literally I'd find compiled machine code in. More like distinguishing between the invariants (underlying laws) that have to be obeyed by any intelligences (c.f. the .@drmichaellevin<br>
 ref), and the underlying implementations (that can vary), whatever they maybe. Like - we have planes that have wings (like birds) but don't flap them (unlike birds).<br>

Matlab matrix engine is excellent. Syntax where matrix is the basic type helps a lot. I cringe every time I read numpy (or even worse pandas) and mutter "another case where worse is better wins". Wish they open sourced the engine and the basic language ages ago. And made their $$$ on toolboxes built on the top of it, their interop, GUI, ease of use, documentation, etc.<br>

Thanks! Sure - I don't disagree with that argument. However - I feel it fails to engage properly my argument (and my nagging suspicion): not this price spike, but all future price spikes.<br>
I see how {personal,situational} pricing is practically possible now with computers, AI and personal surveillance. Atm seller asking price is equal regardless of 1) buyer identity 2) circumstance. Price spiking is deviation in #2, and plenty do it (airlines). Airlines are trying deviating from #1 and that is getting pushback. This is worth the attention b/c previously asking price tailoring to #1 and #2 was not very practical, it was not done a lot. But it's becoming practical now. I believe it should be for the better, as better pricing means better feedback signalling means better production means better consumption means better life for us. 😀<br>
My nagging suspicion is: what becomes of the group cooperation and competition, of the society, if we all engage in mass perfectly rational haggling like that? Maybe AI will be the solution too: my LJ personal AI haggling with RyanAir AI agent for the best outcome for both. 😁 However, then the next worry: will my LJ model will as good as RyanAir model? Or will RyanAir - by virtue of being able to plough huge resource in it, and have all flights data - have the upper hand and always come on top when competing with my LJ model? Will the LJ model then have to cooperate with the yours MP model, share info resource etc, to stand a better chance in the competitive haggling? And so on 😇<br>

In my book, in order of preference best to worst: 1) no barriers, freedom 2) electronic pass 3) paper pass (passport). Given we fell from grace with brexit from best 1 -> to bad 3, moving back to 2 is an improvement afaics. Yeah there's a cost to that.

I'm a 1st gen UK citizen, my kids the 2nd. Forceful repatriation of my kids to the country of their parents (that this blood-and-soil ideologue was working on) is not something I support. US has US laws, and UK has UK laws. US had racial quotas at universities until recently. UK didn't. Stay with US. If I wanted to live like the US - I'd have emigrated in the US. I prefer UK. UK laws and systems have faults (esp the infamous online bill; plus - no one is perfect) - but this is not one of those cases.<br>

Not hard. Found them easy, natural. I started on C64 with Basic and then 6502 assembly. The 1st type learned there is "immediate value" (like - load 3 in register A is "LDA #3"), then the 2nd type one learns is "load value from address" (like - load the byte at address 3003 to register A is "LDA $3003"). So that 3003 is the pointer. That instruction is stored at some address X: AD 03 30. Also one learned to turn that $3003 into say $3004 if needed by incrementing the byte at address X+1. Helped that I already had some idea - at least on paper - of how a CPU, ROM, RAM etc connected together.<br>

Last time I needed help of a human and went to a bank (few years ago) I saw it took them tens of seconds of click-clicking at the right places in the GUI. Slower by a factor of x10-x20 times.<br>

It's never not-amusing (and wild) that in N-dim space, there's almost no space left in the middle. This comes from comparing the volume of an N-cube vs. an N-ball. If space is lacking, so is probability mass, right? Meaning our centrality measures (like the mean), which we use to represent distributions with a single number, become increasingly unrepresentative. Could this be why modern ML sidesteps classical statistics yet still outperforms it (shoutout to Breiman's "Two Cultures")? 🤔 Is there room for better, more N-dim representative alternatives to the mean? Also—can we, or can't we, ignore how Cartesian coordinates (N-cube), Euclidean distance, and the Gaussian distribution are all tightly tied together in this?<br>

Yes, in a way, it's touching. There's something reminiscent of that same 'searching for connection' tendency in both early AI research and the early days of the Internet. It seems that connections are a fundamental requirement for intelligence, at many levels. I remember seeing a video of a single nerve cell under a microscope, extending in random directions, searching—until it finally touches a neighboring cell.<br>

Yeah, same here. I started with just the web interface on my computer, then moved on to my phone, then phone apps. Switched my search engine to http://perplexity.ai (still easy to fall back to good old DDG or Google via the FF dropdown), and now I'm trying @cursor_ai ... I can see how this will end up integrated into everything I do—X reading, wring (amazed I can't check this past Grok already??), web browsing, searching, email, and of course, daily coding. Even when I show my family the LLM summarizing or discussing philosophy and science, switching seamlessly between three languages in voice (OpenAI iPhone app), they're unimpressed. I'll probably have to buy myself a new phone with an NPU. But yeah—people who aren’t asking for something like this won’t be impressed, or if they are, they’ll see it as just a neat trick, like something out of a circus. And for sure, they won’t use it enthusiastically. 😆 You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink. 😇<br>

It's not disruptive at all - seems empirically evidenced. Like Photoshop vv. pictures. Another one for the @PessimistsArc . What is ongoing already and disruptive is the revelation that much of our elites are mediocre or worse, and much of us plebs are too. Hope Internet and AI and others tech are part of the solution addressing that. tbs<br>

☺️  It’s always amusing when people announce they’re leaving X on X. 🤷‍♂️  The iron law of social anything is that a single public square, where connections scale with the square (N^2) of the number of participants (N), will always have the upper hand over any challengers. The real value is in the connections, and those grow quadratically with the user base. Personally, I find my Twitter experience positive overall. It’s not too difficult if you avoid getting wrapped up in the hot topics of the day (though I understand that for public figures, engaging in them might be part of the job).<br>

Sounds about right—what the top 0.01% have today, the median 50th percentile might achieve in a century or two. It’s reminiscent of J.G. Ballard’s Super-Cannes. Perhaps humans just aren't that adept at relating to one another. And maybe AI will out-human us in that regard.<br>

Hey - thanks for the thoughtful reply! I learned something new reading your response. I agree that there's definitely turmoil and realignment happening. I was amused to learn about the original populists (the Cross of Gold speech, etc.).<br>
Fwiw, I believe much of this was set in motion by the change in communication mediums (from mainstream media to the Internet). The idea that "the medium is the message," meaning that the medium shapes and influences the types of messages it carries, seems accurate to me—especially at the higher level of societal influence. That said, it’s almost the opposite of what I’m used to in digital communication on the technical side of things. 😊<br>
I feel like the Internet has caused a sort of turmoil similar to the upheaval brought by the Gutenberg press when the medium last changed. Since messages inspire ideas in people's heads, those ideas inevitably evolve.<br>
I understand why some people are pessimistic about where things are heading, but I still believe we'll get through this. I think all of us will eventually step up and elevate our game in all the ways that matter in real life.<br>

Sparked by a random "ignorant plebs think price gouging is bad, while it's actually good" paper. Thought - maybe the public’s time horizons are longer than we think. Perhaps they’re not just reacting to "this instance of price gouging" but are more concerned with the pattern of "all future price gougings." The question might be: if we allow this now, will society continue to function or begin to fall apart? If each individual, at every point in time, were perfectly rational and solely focused on their own utility for the next day, would the group as a whole still survive? Maybe groups that didn’t share this long-term perspective didn't make it through history.<br>

Are you a member of the elite? If you are - how would you discern self-serving self-interest from value-add on some measure? I agree that elite - through selection and education - is value-add.

Lindy effect?? Lifetimes of intellectual artifacts follow power law distribution.<br>
Assume survival time is a random variable X with a Pareto distribution with p.d.f f(t)=c/t^(c+1) for t≥1, c>0.<br>
If c>1, then expected X is E(X)=c/(c-1). Conditional expectation of X given X survived time k to now is E(X|X>k)=ck/(c-1). So expected additional life for X is ck/(c-1)–k=k/(c-1) and is proportional to the amount of life k seen so far. (special case c=2, the expected additional life equals the life seen so far)<br>

Appreciate the last—thanks! Same here—not here to change opinions, just to express what I think. 😊<br>
I own a business, and some of my employees are struggling, having to choose between heating and eating. What should I do in this situation? Should I let them make that choice, or should I step in? No matter what they decide, it will hurt my business in the long run. Diverting some cash to help them—isn’t that just an investment in my human resources?<br>
Additionally, speaking specifically about France, I also happen to own the energy supplier, so I’m essentially paying myself. The price hikes were largely due to a war that erupted not too far from here. This is precisely the kind of situation that states exist to address. In my view, noblesse oblige—the idea that privilege comes with responsibility—is a good conservative principle.<br>

Exactly right! A good and easy start is flat baseline - 1) term limits 2) age limits, and then work from there. And esp looking towards the future where people are active for longer and live even longer.<br>

I know - thanks. My point is: the contribution is not a %percentage of my salary, but a fixed fee. So when we in the UK draw form the state pension, we also draw a fixed amount. As a %age of the salary, for a lot of people, the NI number is fairly low compared to elsewhere in Europe.<br>

If your policies only appeal to your core supporters, you risk losing the non-supporters. Party members tend to be unrepresentative of the broader, non-party-engaged public. In the US, primary systems select for the more extreme candidates because those candidates have to appeal to party members to pass that internal filter. This creates a natural bias toward extremism.<br>
The UK, a sister culture to the US, recently experimented with this dynamic. The two main parties changed their system for selecting leaders (and future Prime Ministers). The question became: should the leader be chosen by 1) the party members, or 2) the MPs—the Members of Parliament who are elected by the wider public and who must support the future PM in Parliament? After a long period with system #2, both Labour and the Conservatives switched to system #1, where party members chose the leader. Within a couple of electoral cycles, both parties ended up with leaders who appealed to the party members but who appeared insane or unhinged to the broader public. Both leaders subsequently lost their elections.<br>

Hey - thanks for the thoughtful reply! I learned something new reading your response. I agree that there's definitely turmoil and realignment happening. I was amused to learn about the original populists (the Cross of Gold speech, etc.).<br>
Fwiw, I believe much of this was set in motion by the change in communication mediums (from mainstream media to the Internet). The idea that "the medium is the message," meaning that the medium shapes and influences the types of messages it carries, seems accurate to me—especially at the higher level of societal influence. That said, it’s almost the opposite of what I’m used to in digital communication on the technical side of things. 😊<br>
I feel like the Internet has caused a sort of turmoil similar to the upheaval brought by the Gutenberg press when the medium last changed. Since messages inspire ideas in people's heads, those ideas inevitably evolve.<br>
I understand why some people are pessimistic about where things are heading, but I still believe we'll get through this. I think all of us will eventually step up and elevate our game in all the ways that matter in real life.<br>

This imo is not known enough in  the UK: in EU, the pension contributions are %percentage of my salary. In UK, the NI that is the state pension contribution is a *fixed fee*, not a %age of the salary. Hence, when we draw from the pension, we also *all draw* the *same amount*.<br>

We need a 2nd dimension to complement the "$$$ spent" axis. Something along the lines of what you say: confidence level of how good this $1 spent was. We are still using 1930-s technology (thanks Mr Kuznets!) and worked good for a long time - but time for v2 now! Proposals I've seen try to replace it but stay 1D 1-dimensional which seems plain dumb to me. Just go 2D already ffs! Add the next thing we care about (as you say - the quality of that $$$ spend) along an *additional* dimension.<br>

Yeah, I get that, and kudos for not taking the easy road. Two problems here—one easy, one hard.<br>
The easy one: Those who know better than chance head to Bridgewater or the Interest Rates trading desk at Goldman and say nothing. That leaves plenty of room to feed the media macro entertainment complex. Cramer and the clown shows will always have their pull, simply because there's demand from the public. I'm not sure anything can be done about that. It’s kind of like snake oil salesmen before the FDA was established—until regulation comes in, there’s always a market for it.<br>
The hard problem: The challenge with "explaining but not forecasting" is that explaining something doesn't strongly indicate that the theory behind it is correct. Forecasting unseen events—moving beyond the current time horizon—is a much stronger test of a theory's validity. The ability to forecast accurately is the ultimate frontier for testing our models of the world. Of course, even then, some models work—until they don’t. It’s not a 100% foolproof method, but forecasting what hasn’t happened yet is a much tougher test than explaining events that have already occurred.<br>
In my job, forecasting on a one-day horizon is about 50 times harder than explaining the past. Quantifying how much tougher it is underscores just how challenging true forecasting can be.<br>

Distributed intelligence is predictably unintuitive to us, as there’s no single, obvious ‘thing’ to point to and say, ‘that’s what did it.’ Amusingly, this is true even for ourselves—each one of us is a hierarchy of distributed intelligences. The ‘us’ writing this is just one layer in that hierarchy, with lower levels of molecules then cells supporting it, and higher levels - ... tbd?<br>

Maybe I'm misunderstanding this -<br>
> Except perhaps within the family scale, we are communists.<br>
... but I think it's actually the opposite: only at the family level are we communists. Families operate on what are essentially communist principles: from each according to their abilities (parents contributing), to each according to their needs (children consuming). My home is shared among the whole family, and we all "own" it collectively.<br>
This likely explains why this mode of organization feels natural to young people—it’s how most of us are raised and what we experience throughout our formative years.<br>
It seems clear to me that the rules we use to organize human life, whether we’re cooperating or competing, naturally vary depending on scale, the *number* of humans involved. The rules that work for a family of 4 differ from the rules needed to make life bearable when 4 billion people are living together. What works for a small group simply doesn’t scale in the same way for a massive society.<br>

Heh - any excuse to avoid doing the right thing, an excuse for laziness and inaction. Too bad laziness isn't a mortal sin - it'll be our downfall. There's usually only one way to get something done (and it's hard), but there are thousands of easy excuses for why it can't be done<br>

I'm not sure, but I doubt they handle it themselves in any significant way. I'd expect they'd recruit willing peons from us 90% majority. Typically, they target the bottom 10-15% - people already skirting the edges of the law, semi-criminal and not averse to minor crimes. Given a license for violence, they easily escalate. These are also the most pressured by life's circumstances, making them easier to convince, compared to say, the middle class.<br>

No you should not quit. Quitting as 1 is pointless and you will be back soon or worse off. Quiting as 1 of 1 Million users ALL MOVING ON THE SAME DAY to a new platform is the only consequential action possible. Bsky is real alternative and improves our freedom (by not locking my social graph, more freedom friendly underlying protocols). But the migration must be synchronised to happen at about the same time probably within one day, not much longer. And all that move, probably must burn the bridge behind and delete their X account. Not sure how much better long term it is though? In a years' time another blowhard billionaire may buy that platform too??<br>

I understand how some might find Twitter bad—posting a simple comment on a hot topic easily sparks a heated argument with randos looking for a scrap. However, it's easy to avoid fights if you're not interested in hot topics (although I recognize that for journalists, engaging in them is part of the job). Muting boring or ignorant users, blocking rude or uncivil ones early and often, is effective. Trust people when they reveal themselves the first time - what you see is what you get. There are 8 billion other people to interact with.<br>
As for people leaving platforms, the iron law of social anything is: a single public square where connections scale with the square (N^2) of the number of us participants (N) will always have the upper hand. The value lies in the connections, and those connections accrue with the square of the user base.<br>
Personally, I find my Twitter experience positive overall. I read about negative encounters elsewhere, but I rarely see any of that on my timeline. For thematic content, I rely on Lists (e.g. Science, Tech, Computing, Biology, Chemistry, ...) to curate my feed beyond just "For You" and "Followers." Lists help shape my timeline and keep it focused. Additionally, one can tie individual Lists to separate Decks on XPro, effectively creating personalized daily websites. Not sure if many people use this feature. I find it beautiful, if a total time sink as there is too much interesting stuff going.<br>

inflation = rate of increase. as long as above zero - prices are rising. for the prices to come down - you need negative number, negative inflation. if/when that happens - they change the name, (!!) call it de-flation! as long as you hear in-flation, prices are still rising, maybe a tiny bit or maybe a lot - but still rising.<br>

His party had majority 70+ in Parliament. The Parliament is SOVEREIGN. It can bring in any law as it sees fit, simply by a majority walking through the Aye door. Howard-Lords-Courts-etc - sure, just vote in a law. The courts will rule as per that law. What am I missing?

I bet not many have noticed HIV-positive is a not a death sentence anymore like in 1990s. I bet even if some  people notice that no celebrity has died of Aids recently - i.e. not heard in the news recently; pple will reflect when asked explicitly - they have not put the 2+2 together: that Aids from acute became chronic illness, to be kept at bay but not a killer anymore, and that has now been cured too. Miracles happen and we fail to notice. This will be us humans' downfall.<br>

Whattt??? Nooo - I don't want to go to Venezuela. I moved from my home country (MK) to the UK, not Venezuela. I did what I preach. Ofc they're not given the $$$. Your employer is not given the $$$ for nothing, they have to earn it, they have to get $$$ from their customers. So your employer can't make the $$$ either. And their customers are just like you (and me) - they can't make $$$ either, they have to get $$$ from elsewhere too. If any of us (you, me, employer, customers),  make $$$, we'd be counterfeiting. So - who makes the $$$, that we all use and pass between ourselves? That $$$ has to be made at some point, no? In AD1 there were no $$$. Now in AD2024 there are. Between AD1 and AD2024, those $$$ were created. Who created those $$$? Asking b/c whoever created them $$$ - they have huge power. They can buy whatever US produces, and all of it! Huuuge power!!<br>

True that - agreed! Hence the rise of podcasts and other alternative media! Multiple-hours, think Lex Fridman 8h maybe a record. 😂 Rory being a podcaster himself in his new life knows all this and much better than myself. Amazed how much the medium shapes the message. My hope is that boomers will be the last gullible enough generation to be susceptible to mass propaganda. Future propagandist will have to do better than install a head of a TV station. Propagandists adapt (c.f. bot farms, influencers), but us consumers of media can raise our game too. Post-ChatGPT, if I fall for a counter-factual fake where the fact was a GPT question few keystrokes away - well that's on me. Hard to blame anyone else but myself.

Sure - I'd say the problem is more the disproportionate weight given to $1=1 vote compared to 1 person=1 vote. It's not so much that the person is an egomaniac, as there are plenty of non-wealthy egomaniacs among us too. The problem is the perverse incentive: only egomaniacs go for the second billion dollars after they've made their first billion. So it's a double whammy—multiple billions select for egomaniacs, and within the voting system, multiple billions give one person huge influence, skewing everything toward their preferences. Given we are all about equally ignorant about the future, the baseline for the best possible outcome should be based on our equally weighted preferences, with a slight (but only slight) tilt toward 1) character and 2) expertise. 3) Wealth, in my opinion, tends to tilt away from the best outcome (for everyone, on average). The variation in possible outcomes is huge, so the proponents of #1 and #2 better be epistemically humble. But not to the point of being railroaded by #3.<br>

Yeah this is like Peter Turchin's "elite overproduction" IRL. I see EM a part of an anti-establishment elite, battling the established elite in the US (and globally - c.f. UK spat). The established elite manufactures consent; the anti-establishment elite manufactures discontent. The latter rallies the disillusioned, the bottom 10% semi-criminal of us non-elite majority (90% of total), to overthrow the established elite and replace it with a new one (themselves). Manufacturing discontent is what EM does daily.<br>

Yeah. And where the executive function delegation was tried, for the bottom of the pyramid to have control of the top (!!), the "self-management", so there was not 100% total top-down strict command-and-control hierarchy, but the workers could fire the CEO (if they organized enough), that failed too. I would very much like for someone to do research, why and how it failed. My prior/prejudice is that  there must be a role for bottom to top feedback loop in the control and executive functions. But empirically - the "self-management" was a fail. One thing I remember was that the workers would absolutely refuse to hire more workers, to increase the head-count (and cost). IDK, also possible that "self-management" was not a factor in the failures, maybe things would have failed regardless.<br>

Hahah 😂😂 - ne se vospaluvaj tolku od bakracite de? 😂 Realno porano, i mozebi i uste sega, za nekoja upotreba EV bea ponezgodni. Moj primer: vozam 250 milji na sever go nosam deteto na faks vo dom, polna kola do krov. Da sum so EV, na destinacijata, treba da baram polnac, da ja ostavam kolata na 1h-2h da polni, jas da zemam taksi do domot da sreduvame otpakuvame, pa pak nazad po 2h da ja zemam EV od kaj polnac. So ICE za 5 min na benziska polnam benzin i posle brkam drugi raboti. 😂 Ama gledam - mnogu preminaa na EV, nikoj ne se vrati na ICE, nemam eden primer da posocam. Koga se vozev so EV - toa mi ostavi vpecatok: deka samo veteror se slusase, nemase drug zvuk.<br>

Sometimes - and even then: it does not say much if the theory is true or false. Most conspiracy theories are either untrue or unlikely to be true on balance of probabilities, some are true but we never find, others we are lucky to learn (even if decades latter) - e.g. the Soviet Union anthrax leak.<br>
But too many people flip from "conspiracy => untrue" to the opposite "conspiracy => true", without much evidence.<br>
The world does not exist in only two states. For every A that is true, there is infinity of not-A-s that are B, C, D ... Z, that are *all* false. So if say USG says "B is true", your deciding algorithm can't be just "ah-haa! so therefore not-B is the truth, and therefore it is C", when options A, D, E, ... Z exist. Chances are C will be wrong too. One is simply unlikely to hit on the true thing A if the decision algorithm is solely not-B. More likely one will hit on C, D, ... Z - all also untrue.<br>

Да! Прави огромна разлика? И тоа што никој што ќе смени ICE на EV не се враќа назад е мислам од иста причина: откако пробав - возам и слушам само ветер "шшшшш" како на едрилица и ништо друго, назад на ICE е како да седнав во трактор-комбајн. 😂😂 (немам EV не дошол ред уште)<br>

Хахаха 😂😂 Исто и овде. Моите во Македонија мислат овде мед и млеко со векови. Не сакаат да научат дека либерализмот идеологија ("не те сакам, ама те толерирам") измислена како алтернатива на меѓусебно истребување (после децении од покољи). Америка иницијално колонизирана од секта англиски талибанци 😁 на кои домашните талибанци им биле многу "меки", 😶 па хард-кор талибаниве од источна Англија дигнале раце од меките во Лондон (нели нив ионака Господ ќе ги сотре кај да е), се качиле на бротчиња (кога ќе видам колку се мали 😱), и испловиле до Америка. Мислам првата генерација се сите изумрени од глад. Се разбира тоа не ги обесхрабрило другите талибанци зад нив, ма какви. 😱 Добар review на добра книга за 4-те племиња од Британија што иницијално ја колонизираат америка -<br>

I did it twice. The 1st time found 1K (on Bsky) out of 7K (on X), and the 2nd time one week latter added another 500.

Still - an excellent spectacle, much entertainment.<br>
The "rebel rebel" post was priceless. 😂😂😂<br>
In my dreams, I’m in the rebel resistance battling the Death Star.<br>
In real life, I'm one of the richest people in the world, with a possible future president on speed dial. I’m aligned with, and possibly financing, the party controlling much of the US federal and state legislatures, plus the top judiciary.<br>
Then, an unambiguous test appears (RUS invasion of UKR, attempted genocide). I side with Mordor. I fail the test.<br>
EM is part of an anti-establishment elite, battling the established elite in the US (and globally - c.f. UK spat). The established elite manufactures consent; the anti-establishment elite manufactures discontent. The latter rallies the disillusioned, the bottom 10% semi-criminal of us non-elite majority (90% of total), to overthrow the established elite and replace it with a new one (themselves). Manufacturing discontent is what EM does daily.<br>
I hope EM fails. Don't think fascist-curious Thiel-type ideologues will do well, expect them to rule badly. "Country is not a Company" is a good read on how running a business is almost an anti-preparation for running a country.<br>

I find the experience sleek and smooth, Bsky seems a full on Tweeter clone + enhancements. Still - will not be displacing Twitter anytime soon. In a single public square, N^2 wins every time, :-) the iron law of social anything if you will. It's a natural monopoly. The number of connections N^2 grows with the square of the number of us, the nodes N. And the value grows with the connections. Social networks are on the more extreme end of "winner takes all".<br>

😇 Heh - idk whether you believe this for real or... Somewhat motivated reasoning imo to go from "net favorability score" to "hate". From the report you link to: PM landslide victory achieved at net favorability score of -18, rising post election to 0 (max ever), now dropping to -16, still higher than pre-election. There are other stats in the report (and prior ones; PM v.s. the rest, the party etc), none I'd read as "hate". If you're genuinely interested in numbers, a slight book by Chivers' "How to Read Numbers" is one I liked.<br>

Good example. For traffic purposes, we don't care who the person is (by Name Surname; million pass daily, don't care abt the names), we just care that a person that entered at entrance A took 10 mins to reach point B at the platform. Or 20 mins - the difference makes a difference. It can be done - maximise gain within constraints, minimise risk.<br>

I think trusting the other is the default for us humans. We trust unless there are reasons to distrust. And even then we allow wait to the third transgression to lose trust. KGB-communist-oligarch - well most were of that sort at that point. Yeltzin was probably popular to start with. It's up to the Russian elite and downstream to the Russian people what happens. Bush-Blair had some agency but miniscule in comparison I think. We overestimate how much we can influence things. There is much more randomness, chance, than most people admit. Having witnessed historic events personally - when I hear people talk about them now, oft I don't recognise what they describe, has little bearing to reality as I remember it then. I do remember - it's not my memory failing me.<br>

This is too funny and yet oddly touching—textbook cognitive dissonance. 😇<br>
In my dreams, I’m in the rebel resistance battling the Death Star.<br>
In real life, I'm one of the richest people in the world, with a possible future president on speed dial. I’m aligned with, and possibly financing, the party controlling much of the U.S. federal and state legislatures, plus the top judiciary.<br>
Then, when an unambiguous test appears (RUS invasion of UKR, attempted genocide), I side with Mordor. I fail the test.<br>
What’s amazing is how I end up in positions where I stand to benefit if my bets pay off. EM is part of an anti-establishment elite, battling the established elite in the U.S. and globally. The established elite manufactures consent; the anti-establishment elite manufactures discontent. The latter rallies the disillusioned, the bottom 10% semi-criminal of us non-elite majority, to overthrow the established elite and replace it with a new one (themselves). Manufacturing discontent is exactly what EM does daily.<br>

Cool - meaning what? That the shares can't be taxed at London Stock Exchange register? Example. When one gets a mortgage, the lender puts a Charge in the register of the Land Registry. So regardless of how obscured the beneficial owner is - the mortgage lender is never cheated. Imagine - shares instead of a house, LSE instead of Land Registry, HMRC instead of the mortgage lender. :-)<br>

Agree. An obscure '90s book The Erect Woman (originally The Planet of Women) dives into this idea. It argues that sexuality, particularly the control of sexual attraction by women, was the key factor in human evolution. This bond, driven by sexual dynamics, was more influential than labor, tools, opposing thumbs, brain size, etc<br>

True - if there is no assets value growth. One could tax the growth in value (and not the value itself; like property capital gains). Assume assets value grows 4% p.a. If a tax is 0.5%, now the assets growth is going to be 3.5% instead of 4%. So it slows down the growth of asset value. Compounded 50yrs - at 4% value is up 711%, at 3.5% value is up 558%. We are still talking about enormous increase of  assets value.<br>

Ok - that impacts valuation. Valuation is not investment - no? Like I'm investor deciding whether to fund the next Deep Mind in London, or in Paris. This extra tax - that I may or may not have to pay - is another cost, like 100s other costs I have in my spreadsheet.<br>

Maybe, but please make your case. How will that happen, what are the mechanics of that?<br>
Atm I know this: say you own 100 shares in SBRY, I have 100 pounds in cash, we swap what we have (I get the 100 shares, you get the 100 pounds), the transaction means nothing at all to SBRY.<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
Yes I'd expect the valuations will fail with taxation. Do you think high FTSE => good times in the UK? Have you not witnessed the last 20yrs of UK when that did not happen? What am I missing. I'm sure there are arguments against - but what you put forward is not strong imo. Asset prices going up are obv good for the owners of existing assets, and obv bad for for anyone that aspires to buy them. So a wash in the grand total.<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
Obv shares still get taxed - no? LSE issued SBRY shares, assume 1% tax, for every 100 shares either the owner pays £££ value of 1 share to HMRC, or whoever owned 100 shares now owns 99, and 1 share belongs to HMRC, or a Charge is put in the the register (like for a mortgage on a property in the Land Registry), to be paid when future transfer of ownership.

No please don't. Enjoying your analysis of the chief Twit propaganda. Mute if you must. But there is no way around - his ideas, where stupid, can only be defeated by other, smarter not stupid, ideas. There is no other way unfortunately. 😔 Even if it takes unreasonable energy and effort on your part. I sort of understand you how exhausting this must be.

Well there's that one fatal flow: if I - even if not yet a stalin - single handily own all companies in the land, appoint their CEO-s and CFO-s as my personal picks - can you imagine the ammount of power I wield? I don't think many pple can. I'm not saying it's inevitable that I soon am to wield the power of life and death over every single citizen in my realm. But if I am ambitious, energetic, talented - I can, in the end. And a hierarchical system selects for those traits. Esp when without a fixed term limit! That's crucial - I stay, all competitors exit sooner or latter. The new younger challengers are ever more like innocent know-nothing children facing/competing a/with dragon really. They stand zero chance, I crush them at will. There is a reason when a system tried at different times, geographies, cultures and peoples - fails universally given the time. (rope?)<br>

Not only propaganda though, is it? The fraction that is anti-individualistic hence anti-liberal, that judges the individual person on the color of their skin i.e group membership, is what rubs a lot of people the wrong way. NB the anti-Asian quotas at US universities struck down by the US supreme court ruling. There is a reason that woke took off (systemic racism), and there is a reason why anti-woke took off too (judging people by their assigned membership of a group, rather than as 100% individuals). In retrospect - sticking to plain old boring liberal "sole individual" may have been the least bad option imo.<br>

Yes - excellent take. Yep - EM is part of the anti-establishment elite, battling for supremacy with the established elite. Established elite propaganda manufactures consent,  anti-establishment elite propaganda manufactures discontent. The latter is to rile up the rubes, the bottom 10% semi-criminal of the 90% that is the non-elite majority, in sufficient numbers, as to overthrown the established elite and replace it with a new one.

Haha 😅 - as is their form, as per the usual, CA-lifornian techies assume "we are the world", then go forth and apply ideas of a very specific country (CA part of US), from a very specific time (1990+), to everything and all in their path. All while decrying the "globalist elite". It's amusing and entertaining though. Latest gem I saw from the chief-Twit and cd not resist the temptation to give back e piece of my mind 😂😂😂<br>

Whattt?? Surprised to hear EEurope cities were dangerous in the 1990-s... Socialism had bazillion failings, but not high crime rates afa I remember from my childhood. Key-around-the-neck and walking home to school & back since 7-8-9yo, roaming the neighborhood after school with friends - that was my childhood. Back home upon friends dispersing b/c of mums shouting from balconies to come back home for dinner, or on nightfall, or us getting exhausted or bored.<br>

It's no doubt doable. Then the Qs are is it a good idea, will it work i.e. achieve the desired aim, what are the negatives the ill effects, and then the politics of it (that's another long chain - but also doable).<br>

Not *automatically*, but it's *necessary*, if not *sufficient* condition. Consider - for desired outcome D (=increase number pf people getting homes), maybe per-requisites A, B, and C must happen. All three of them - not just one. Assume the above is A=increase supply, build more. While it is not sufficient, it is necessary.  Does this model make things make more sense? Then there will be factors B=offer price (we don't want ask price to go up much), also C=finance availability (affects the bid price) and so on.<br>

Nah. I think "what you see is what you get" and "take people at their word" is the best performing judgement strategy. Yes it makes errors but all strategies make errors judging and I think this one errs the least of all alternatives I can think of. (mind games, 8dim chess, etc)<br>

It can - but the property is in the UK, it can be taxed. There maybe a record of the Ultimatey benefitial owner, but even when obscured: if the tax man wants it can ultimately seize the property if due tax is unpaid. The owner will show up without a fail - that's not a problem.<br>
In the replies 2 possible negatives were mentioned:<br>
1. Was tried in France and Sweden -failed and abandoned. (didn't check what happened myself)<br>
2. Asset prices will decline, the higher the tax, the more they decline, the less tax is collected. This to be expected - so the better question is: how much of that, quantify it.<br>

:-) Ok, fwiw I don't think his proposal is 100% tax rate of wealth, b/c as you correctly say - that can be only done once, and will lead to complete ruination of the nation. IDK what exact number he proposes, but think we can safely say the number will be much less than 100%.<br>

... for the 4th time: the new owner will own the same shares, and those shares are taxed. Regardless of the owner. Tax on assets is not tax on income. Owners are perfectly fine to sell them off, take their cash and go buy elsewhere. The assets stay, only the owner changes.<br>

Did you miss the part "... person can leave, but the assets stay in the UK"? His proposed tax is on assets appreciation, on wealth value increase - not on income. I'm not saying it's good or bad (idk) - but you are not addressing his claim.<br>

Exactly - there is always some risk, there is no complete certainty. Posting this may land me in trouble. Is it a bad thing to have skin in the game at all times? Nothing to be absolutely zero risk? Everyone of us to feel just a tiny bit of pressure to get it right rather than wrong? I always remember how even a token fee for food in a school canteen cuts the otherwise frequent food fights drastically. One may even say - am I even an existing individual if no matter what I do it doesn't matter one iota. Yeah I agree we don't want to be jailing people to stop them expressing their opinions. We want everyone to be able to express themselves should they choose to.<br>

Indeed - if and when *the truth* is suppressed. Is every speech suppress on X suppressing the truth though? Any instances of non-truths suppressed on X? I like my free speech very much too. I can post both truths and untruths on X. So speech-truth are related but not identical.<br>

Thanks good to learn. Affirms (by not contradicting) my mental model "Y is a program of instructions, its execution is the process of building the male half of the species" (and by extension "the default of the species is female; XX but also very rare malfunctioning Y").<br>

Agree on the 2nd point ("live better than kings of past"), disagree on 1sr point "meaningless": that's too strong, $$$ is meaningful for me as with $$$ I buy time for example. Society is "1t come 1st serve" (great!) but with qualification "must bring enough $$$ tokens to consume the service/good". (uh-oh) The $$$ tokens are a means of rationing, as we don't have universal infinite abundance. (despite having much higher abundance than in the past; higher yes, infinite no)<br>

Line will be drawn randomly, arbitrarily, and I presume on a case by case basis, as we are doing now by discussing all this in the open. 😁 This is the process of drafting that line. 😀 Not relevant to this but completely  complementary (if related): was chuffed to learn that in chess there is not a male-only category.  Only women only category exists. So women are completely free to compete with man as they please. (but the opposite is not the case ofc) That seems like a low hanging fruit for other sports to take on?<br>

Good food for thought though. 😊 Let's take the 2nd most import item (as singular easer to work with than the 1st - food) - shelter, housing. It wd mean a government program of building housing. So presumably a government (maybe local gov?) owned building company building houses and selling them on the open market? The difference to existing builders being - the ownership structure and thus filtering to incentives maybe: stay in profit, must be profit>0 positive, but no incentive to maximise profit, don't chase max{profit}. Instead, chase max{volume}, incentive is to build *and sell* (v.important to sell them too) the largest volume by units. The company would be bankrupt shut down as any other company if it loses $$$. So not immortal like a government, can die if bad. Selling on the open market will put it under market discipline. I'm sceptical abt gov anything - but I guess one could do small scale experiments? Not unlike the UBI ones. Opportunity for cozy low level corruption I guess with other gov branches doing planning and building permits - but that'd be no worse than existing private non-gov builders?<br>

Not on the censorship, not on this case, but in general. To me Y in XY means the programs (the sets of instructions) of how to build a male are present, so they can potentially be put in action (and usually are). But a mere presence does not make it certain that the Y programs were executed and put in action during development. No?<br>

You are right - I can't. And even if my heading reads "2013", I did not use Twitter much until years latter. So mine is a very particular view. I've using it in parallel with using bsky and mastodon from time time, and by the sheer volume of content (both good and bad) Twitter dwarfs them. My point was that this is entirely unsurprising. It's expected and explained in (computer) networks: the number of connections ~N^2 grows with the square of the number of nodes ~N. And the value grows with the connections. Social networks seems to be on the more extreme end of "winner takes all", unfortunately.<br>

I think you are right: those bubbles are almost by definition necessary for breakthroughs. And yes, much will be wasted - but that's the nature of R&D, if we knew what's not going to work, we wd not be doing it ofc! :-) Many are truly uncomfortable with the idea "we put all this effort time material $$$, but we failed didn't pan out" that almost block that aspect and just zoom in on  the successes. :-) And find the fails surprising as if a fail is an exception rather than an expectation. You are right that the scale of capital (ultimately the domestic market that supports that) and number of people trying (that sharpen the competition) are unique in scale to US and China. That's why the future happens there first.<br>

Anna kindly explained in  the next message: it's that in Economics the reviews are not doubly blind, it's that reviewers can see papers authors names?? I did not expect that, didn't know, and did not read through carefully enough. That's what she refers to "evaluate the substance" - to judge the paper on the content only, not on the names of the authors.<br>

Хаха 😂😂 - даа така е, потврдувам. Commiserations 😑 Куриозитет: во еден момент правилата на транслитерација (пред 1998-ма?) се сменија кусо, и "Љ" се транслитерираше " L' " (L со апостроф). Отворена сметка во банка со L' во името следните 25 год не успеав да го сменам назад во "LJ". 😅 (подоцна правилото се смени, во следниот пасош "Љ" се транслитерира "LJ" како и сега)<br>

agreed on income taxes and taxes favoring children. don't like taxes myself ofc, and never heard of anyone that does tbh. still puzzled by the idea of i/morality. idk how the usual criteria for morality (golden rule, silver rule, utilitarianism, universalizing the maxim) wd apply to taxes, but: if no modern human society exists with 0 taxes, one cd conclude they're necessary evil? that without them our society would disintegrate? don't see what else is there tbh<br>

You are right to be dismayed. Before we all join in - how would I decide under uncertainty? When I largely don't know, but I'm forced to make a yes/no decision. (no-comment/abstain is not allowed is treated the same as either yes or no) I suspect "defer to other's opinion" will be the least worst strategy. When having to make a decision under uncertainty. And almost all real life decisions are with incomplete fuzzy uncertain information.<br>

Is the biggest enemy of free speech media publishing  lies, untruths? Does this empower the argument that "free speech will destroy us"? With social media turning everyone into a publisher, media includes everyone of us so incl EM lies like https://x.com/i/trending/1821575612009730497 are a good example too. If everything everyone ever published was true, would only tyrants be against free speech, but everyone else for? How come free is exception rather than the rule? A pessimist might argue that societies with total free speech were undermined by lies, leading to a world where only restricted speech survives. Aka with great power comes great responsibility. What do you think? Congrats on the excellent interview - really enjoyed it. (ps you can strengthen your "no evidence humans are computers only" argument)<br>
Musk Spreads Fake Detainment Camps Story<br>

Elon Musk shared a fake Telegraph headline on his social media platform, X, suggesting that UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer was considering building 'emergency detainment camps' on the Falkland Islands for rioters. The post, which was initially shared by the co-leader of the far-right group Britain First, Ashlea Simon, was deleted by Musk after it had been viewed nearly 2 million times. The Telegraph confirmed that no such article had ever been published by them. The incident has sparked criticism and concern over the spread of misinformation and the role of social media platforms in amplifying false narratives.<br>

A: EM and yourself are not mere observers from 10000m. No - you influence the events. Ofc you will retort "but I'm a lowly podcaster" and deny your power. But that's what every powerful person ever does. Don't you see?<br>

Heh - but of course if they chanted outside, the cameras will not catch that. (even if the public physically present will hear them abt the same way when chanting inside; modulo inside audience is more captured) They know this perfectly well. The public square space is one and finite, they are trying to get a bigger pie of the reach for themselves, and leave smaller piece to everyone else. It's not an accident or an oversight - it's intentional and planned.<br>

What you are describing is akin to Stalin-type dictatorship. Laws brought in are deliberately illogical so many interpretations are possible, and then the stalin at the top decides on the interpretation on a given day. Without constraints - what's good ok today is decided to be bad punishable tomorrow etc. Every person is possibly in violation of the laws, possibly guilty, and no one knows or can determine in advance. You are describing a setup that's hitler germany or stalin soviet union, Hanna Ardent wd recognize this.<br>

I get why people are cautious, and mine is a minority opinion. Honestly, X isn't a hill I care much about either way. I'm even more pro-sharing sensitive data in the NHS, where more data = better care = lives saved. "Data for the People" by @aweigend convinced me. The gist: yes, there's a power imbalance due to data and knowledge. We can balance it by reducing data available about us. But there's another way: balance by increasing data available from institutions wielding power over us, making them much more transparent. Even radically transparent—everything out in the open by default, and secret only when needed. Currently, it's the other way around with state institutions and companies that wield enormous power over my life.<br>

Very good and thoughtful piece by @sjwrenlewis , and then there's this zinger:<br>
> When the propaganda involves right wing populism, it isn’t manufacturing consent but rather manufacturing discontent.<br>
That's exactly right. When buffoons cosplaying clowns take over, they have neither the interest nor the ability to exercise the state power to solve problems. Instead, and almost by instinct rather than explicit plan, they find a wound in the body public and drill into it relentlessly until the public screams in pain. Once the public becomes numb from exhaustion, they move on to the next wound and repeat the process.<br>

Establishments punish words because they lead to actions. They worry about actions that follow from words. No one cares about your thoughts while they stay in your head. The sequence is: Thoughts -> Words -> Actions. This self-importance is becoming insufferable. https://x.com/naval/status/1/naval/status/1820814537152750071<br>

Nah - they punish words b/c words lead to actions. That's why all establishments at all times are worried about the words: b/c actions follow from the words. No one cares about your thoughts while they are still in your head. Don't flatter yourself.<br>

The bet that "for everything, for the infinite domain, every human is about equally ignorant" seems to have born out. Yes in a domain X person Y will know much more than than the rest of humanity, and make better decision in domain X. But when considering almost infinite number of domains? Seems assuming "we are equal" is the least bad, i.e. a bad idea except for all others that have been tried and shown to be even worse. Private sector - given companies are siloed, are hierarchical dictatorships with the power to squash any one individual ex/worker, internal information does not leak out easily, it's harder to judge then science (open by default) and politics (used to be very closed, now very open). But thinking of my own history the experience working in various companies - yeah, plenty of silly decision, trial & error there too.<br>

😂😂😂 Отидоа од едни на други. За секој еден што продаде - некој друг купи. Не ни знаеме дали тој што продава купил поскапо, па сега да губи. Можеби купил поефтино. По општо: зашто скапи акции би биле апсолутно добри? Добри се ако веќе ги имаш. Ама ако ги немам и сега сакам да купам - тогаш поскапо е полошо, така? Ако имаш леб во рака - ти менува нешто на подобро ако сега поскапи? Па утре ќе треба пак да го купам - нели е подобро да е поефтин лебот?<br>

Well, not directly. If it did, we'd know, as chemistry is very mechanistic. It correlates somewhat via other factors, but its significance is unclear in the grand scheme. The same England (and Europe) of the Industrial Revolution were part of the Roman Empire once, and no industrial revolution happened then. With talk of colonizing Mars, we wish we had a foolproof recipe for societal success. We can't even guarantee it on a smaller scale with companies—most startups fail.<br>

Relatedly, Chomsky and his theory of language serve as a cautionary tale for the consequences of theories that "can't easily do experiments." If I have a theory that can't be easily disproved by experiment, shouldn't I be even more uncertain of it? Shouldn't I be more cautious about pushing it and more receptive to any emerging counter-evidence? When the first language models appeared, wouldn't it be logical to take a keen interest in them, to try to understand and learn from this new development seemingly related to my work?<br>
As far as I know, Chomsky did everything wrong there. He ignored new insights about language that we gained and refused to take on board anything machine learning-related. This resistance to change raises a speculative question: was he just bad with numbers or innumerate, thus incapable of adapting? This situation reminds me of Norvig's critique (http://norvig.com/chomsky.html), which was relevant years ago, but now, with GPT and large language models, the initially small crack has developed into a chasm.<br>

Of course, how could it be otherwise? How could a gene coding for the expression of melanin, a pigment, affect the brain? It can't. Culture is nearly everything. That explains how societies can change so fast too (e.g. UK industrial revolution) – culture is much faster to adapt, much more malleable. If we were to wait for the genes to change for the industrial revolution to happen – well, we'd still be waiting. Also, this is how US enemies/competitors underestimate the US social cohesion. Their immigrants self-select for the culture; people going to the US do so because they find the culture appealing (life, liberty, pursuit of happiness). Ultimately, I am an immigrant to England because I found its culture more appealing than that of my native country, Macedonia, having come by random chance to do a PhD.<br>

Imame "the media is the message" vo smisla: formata ima vlijanie vrz sushtinata na porakata. So Internet i posledno so socijalnite mrezi formata se smeni kompletno od toa sto bese do 1990-ta. Prethodno mass media komunikacijata bese ednosmerna, TV stanica -> milioni luge. A sega so Internet e dvosmerna (miloni luge)<->(milioni luge), i socijalnite mediumi ovozmozija sekoj od nas so malku trud da bide izdavac, publisher. Prethodna golema promena sto ja pamtime najbliska za sporedba e voveduvanje na elektronski mediumi - radio, televizija.

Out if his depth and out of his mind. But the stupid on display is not random, it has a specific bias. Of the "Your country is not a company"-type: the non-business part of society does all the stuff that business can't or shouldn't for varying reasons. It's a know blind spot. When I synchronize the cooperation of large groups of people through employment meaning if they don't do as per the agreed plan (oft top-down plan) they will go hungry, homeless and possibly die, I may have difficulty imagining how similar feat of collaboration is achieved with even bigger groups of people (by orders of magnitude - x100, x1000 times bigger), where that instrument is *NOT available*. Expected better on that front from someone who aims to colonize Mars tbh, as that involves starting up a country afaics.<br>

IDK how you get from this to civil wars, but hey - you be you. As already written - we have plenty of evidence that culture counts for much more, and genes for much less, compared to the story you wrote. For starters if genes were as important as you think there would be no empires in history ever, with everyone minding their genes in the confines of their village. Heck - in biology individuals (not just humans - but most of things alive, animals and plants) would not mate so not to drop 50% of their material in every iteration! If that was all that mattered.<br>

Not universally, it's a hit-and-miss for the state as it is for the private sector. Asian development (Japan, Asian tigers, China, now the rest joining in) 19th-21st century is an example state+private working together to enhance their +ves and cover each others -ves. African countries in the same period seem to be an example of the opposite. Afaik the central question of developmental economics "what's the recipe, the algorithm, howto make a poor country into a rich country" is still unresolved. We lack that kind that level of knowledge. But the pickings are so great (should that problem be solved) that I think developmental economists who say "once you see the gains of poor country becoming rich, solving any other problem in Economics the gains seem pitiful in comparison" are completely right. Ha-Joon Chang has books as well as as YouTube videos on this. Plus some v.funny and entertaining moments there. 😁<br>

Pathetic - It's said as if civil war is per-ordained, as if we are helpless to do anything abt it. In fact it's exactly the opposite: war is an organized activity, does not just happen out of nowhere. Pple organize in military units, acquire and distribute weapons and so on. So we can chose to just *not* do that, *not* wage civil war. It's not hard - in fact starting a civil war is difficult and takes lots of preparation and also propagandizing the population for non-trivial length of time. (1-2-3yrs)<br>
Imbecilic - There is not a sign of anything "war like" happening in the UK atm. On the other hand, summer riots are about as seasonal a constant in the UK as the weather patterns. Sometimes larger in scale, most often smaller. Always ignited by some outrageous criminal event.<br>
Musk is seeing what he hopes to happen. Seems his circle have convinced themselves that the end of our civilization, the world even - is upon us. Now everything gets interpreted in that light. Further, he calls for it, tries to influence things so it happens (using his platform - like every media proprietor before him!) - end of USD, hyperinflation, end of US, end of western civilization and so on. It's very sad to observe a person caught in "When Prophecy Fails" type situation.<br>

:-) Yep, about once a year, sometimes in May ("sell in May and go away"), other times in Aug (holidays, low volumes, thin trading), there is a mini market crash. Latter in the year b4 Xmas (end of year, tax loss harvesting) there is a patriotic rally too. :-) Rule of thumb - abt 67% of the days a daily market move is in the +/-1% percent range. Then there is the other 33% when the move is outside that range. It's great chat the market talk, b/c it's evergreen, there is always something happening. Heck - in the US there is an entire media-macro-entertainment complex, with Crammer-clowns with props and everything at the bottom, and more sophisticated players further up the value chain, providing entertainment daily. I don't begrudge their choice of profession to them! No worse content than the "Housewives of X" or similar. Plus makes the markets mass consumption product. Like going gambling in Vegas: no one goes there expecting to get back richer. Pple expect to be entertained and are happy to pay for that. It works out for everybody. A daily chat about the weather in the UK would be closest to that, in that it's never ending, but way way less excitable and marketable. ;-)<br>

👏🙏 Thanks, will pocket that. 😆 After 20yrs quant market neutral mid-to-high frequency: best thing to happen to me as industrial (non academic) researcher. 😄 R&D&trading is fun, stuff happens daily. There is high leverage - half dozen pple can startup a multi-B book. There is good mix of data donkey work, modelling and forecasting, optimization, dev work, plus ops fun running things on calc farms. (admittedly - woken up oncall to fix Tokyo trading at 1am is less fun 🙃) Only $$$ profit matters in the end so mostly objective modulo luck (incl lack of it; HF easier to separate skill from luck). Principals are mostly sane b/c idiots are quickly enough weeded out by competition. Profitability is insane compared to anything outside Tech. We eat our product, there are no customers, clients (if one is not Prop) only care abt $$$ anyway (despite any stories they tell; covered above).<br>

Yeah mostly agree. Slight difference, and this is entirely subjective, and maybe more US and less UK: establishment/center-s are tad different.

Се надева EM, баби се снило што јој мило. Од UK не ми личи така. Никој не знае што носи иднината, ама: другарите на ЕМ немаат голема поддршка, летни нереди со кршење и палење имаме секое лето, сегашниот PM беше јавен обвинител кога пред 10-ина години имаше едни од поголемите.<br>

The industrialized world has become x10 times more wealthy in the past 100yrs - and we got social programs, security, etc. This includes UBI - for old people, and for rich people. So it works ok in principle, and in small scale, but we're not yet smart and rich enough to roll it out for all atm. But it's a matter of time. In the next 100yrs expect countries that don't go crazy and screw up to get another x10 times richer. Between now and then, for those countries - UBI will become a no brainer, will be done and common opinion will be that anything else is unspeakable barbarity. Not to be mentioned in polite company that we used to do no-UBI and let valuable human resource (the ultimate resource in the known universe!!! no less) rot on the streets for homelessness and similar. A question of time. SV tech entrepreneurs are too timid in social engineering - yay @sama ! 👍💪; boo @elonmusk 👎. It falls to them to do more, given how incompetent the non-tech world is it seems.

AI can't come soon enough. Atm we have AS - Artificial Stupidity. Automated but un-intelligent. I tell X algo everything about me (name, age, address, CC info), spend hours on the platform clicking this-and-that (all tracked ofc). The stuff it come up with for me is just cr*p. That is - when it doesn't suspect that I'm not a human (how??) and restricts my account! But without telling me anything - ofc!! Why would omnipotent creature provide receipts for anything? I'll say why: b/c the quality if its operation on mine/user-facing side is abysmal. Current social media is like Kafka's tales realized. I don't mind the tracking, I do mind the platform being an imbecile - offering just stupid dreck to me after all that tracking. cc @elonmusk<br>

Mislam deka treba da ima pretplata (ne e zdravo 100% prihod od reklami, podobro od poveke izvori po pomalku, plus pretplata pomaga vo verifikacija) ama mislam i deka ne e zdravo platformata da e plaything na King Elon. Site proprietors kupuvaat mediumi za da gi iskoristat kako megafon, site da naucime sto imaat da ni kazat - ok.

Yeah - but it's general as per the course, everything that makes the news is an exception an outlier rare curiosity. As such will not matter much in the grand scheme of things most of the time. Rare are the events that one can truly say changed the course of history, and even then counter factuals like - e.g. if not for Princip wd have been something else - make a lot of sense to me tbh.<br>

Nah - you check and tell me what you find. Even if I check - there is no way for me to be certain, that in my head, the same idea will form, that is currently in your head. Hence - writing, speaking, we use them to relay ideas to others. So if you want to relay an idea to me - write it here. I hope that makes sense to you.<br>
I'm not mock angry - I'm real angry with people lying with statistics and numbers. I though it was an oversight (we all make errors, numbers are un-intuitive to us, there is never enough time to double check everything), but OP subsequent doubling down dissuaded me.<br>

Do you accept this, @VjosaOsmaniPRKS ? @VudiXhymshiti is engaging in a tactic often used by RUS and SRB: accusing others of what you yourself are doing.

Coming back to this (1/2): Imagine if this were Mark Rutte. What would Rutte do if his personal detail pulled a gun on airport security? What would the Dutch public expect him to do? Kosovars (as do most Balkanists) aspire to live like the rest of Europeans. To achieve that, you need to start valuing more what Dutch do (c.f. WEIRD the book), and less what you currently value. There are reasons why the Netherlands and Kosovo are the way they are. At a minimum, @VjosaOsmaniPRKS<br>
 should apologize to the public—both in MKD for the fuss caused and in KOS for the poor representation. The second-best option is for her to take responsibility and #VjosaOsmaniPRKSresign. @VudiXhymshiti<br>

It makes a huge difference, as in: is 1.5M vacant homes too high, or is it too low maybe? What does 1.5M mean? We get a handle on the meaning of the raw number by comparing with similar 1) in time; and 2) in space. We actually learn - it's a comparatively low number, not a high number, as - I now understand - you were meant to imply. FR and NL have the equivalent numbers higher. Please follow up on the short books refd.<br>
Anecdotal evidence: my neighbor in a shared semi- passed away unfortunately, and her half of the house has been 1) empty for 1 yr while on sale 2) empty for a 2nd year while being renovated. There's 1 of your 1.5M.<br>
I'm speaking my mind, I'm not wealthy in absolute terms, I'm a quant trader and a researcher and a developer, my kids are (or will be soon) looking for a home. So very much relevant.<br>

Many nations on the Continent have "performative miserableism" that I find UK (and US) don't have. For whatever reason - it seems ok to default to "No/n!" Answer to any random Question. IDK why that's the case. Think last time saw it abt c19 vaccines - surveyed answers to "wd you take one" were "yes" only 40%, and latter the actual vaccine uptake was more than double that.<br>

:-) I think s/he 1) put out a BIG number (1.5M) raw; then 2) concluded there is no housing shortage. While #1 is fine, not a crime, it's a start to put out a raw number/ Then the honest thing is to follow up and put the number in context. In perspective these 1.5M empty homes: 3) How do they compare to historic/time average of the same measure? 4) How do they compare to our geographic peers (for EN - usually Scotland, or FR and NL) that measure about the same? To jump to #2 is wholly unwarranted. To imply #2 in the minds of your audience, all the while maintaining plausible deniability, is even worse in my book tbh! It would imply premediation and forethought and not mere misleading out of rush judgement (and ignorance). That would really be the pits, I think (and hope!) it's not the case. We've had "How to Lie with Statistics" for ages now, more recently .@TomChivers<br>

Stop digging. Having the raw number out is not a crime (neither is a mystery). Deriving any conclusions from a raw number - without: how does it compare to the same number through history (1yr, 2yrs, 10yrs ago), how does it compare to geographical peers France, Netherlands, etc - is a statistics crime, is a bad thing to do. Accept this was not your best hour, learn from the experience, clear things up to everyone you misled - and you will move on better and stronger. If your ego gets the better of you, on the other hand ...<br>

Yeah, IDK how someone this invested in the issue, thus presumed to have learned and thought about it, can do a lazy-silly take. I'm not interested enough to learn the details of this particular case. But a framework I, a side watcher/civilian have found useful to put things in context for me is this. The chromosomes are programs, a long series of instructions. They drive the body/parts to develop/grow (and crucially - stop growing too) as per those instructions. So everyone wd be an XX female by default, except: where Y is present in XY cells, the instructions Y carries are executed on. This is not a single step, not a single 0/1 yes/no switch, but a longer chain of events, a series of steps and processes one after the other, all prompted and guided by the programs in that Y chromosome. This is over a non-trivial amount of time too - as for the rest of human development from a single cell onwards. If all goes as per the hard-coded plan, if all the steps are executed without errors - we get a XY male at the end of the process. However: sometimes the instructions in Y are not completely right to the very end, and sometimes for whatever random reasons (like when a computer RAM has cosmic ray flipping bits, so we need ECC error correction) they are not executed completely right as intended to the end. This is rare enough as not to matter much in the grand scheme of things for humanity (except - for the individual affected). But now that we are all connected and all public on social media - we are all made aware of what wd have been an local curiosity a 100 yrs ago.<br>

True that it takes effort to ignore it. Truth is what's shared by all by default, it's the minimum energy, minimum effort configuration. By most of us - but not all. Accomplished deceptionists have their truth sensor weak or malfunctioning so to be almost unbothered by untruth.<br>

After some thought over the years I moved 101% in the pro-GMO-for-everything camp. Yes - there is a small risk for a disaster and we have only one Earth. However - such disaster was possible in pre-GMO days, GMO is much more controlled than previous random trial&error, we've had 30yrs of data now and none of the anti-GMO fears (now we can call them - scares) have materialized. So I'm very relaxed about all things GMO. Ofc - ymmv! :-) There is a non-zero risk of not going full-on GMO too. Continuing "as we did so far" is a non-zero risk too.<br>

Hey @rorysutherland , at 49" here (time in link) https://youtube.com/watch?v=KZ57cYqZZKI&t=2940s , there is solid maths on "average does not exist" claim. In Ndim spaces, for sufficiently high N (which is not very high still - say N>12 i.e. a dozen!), the "central area" of the space, or probability mass if you like - is empty! The center is empty and all space goes squeezes in the edges. We learn this from looking how the ratio of Nvolume of Nsphere relative to Ncube behaves when we let N go high (ultimately - to infinity). If all probability mass goes to the edges, and there is nothing in the center => every one of your observations is going to be an outlier, in some dimension (there is OR operator at work there; conversely, to be in the center, the point has to be non-extreme in ALL dimension, there is an AND operator there at work). Noticed it b/c of recent memes abt Ndim spaces, seems some AI influencers discovered them e.g. https://x.com/RokoMijic/status/1818073988805152801<br>

(as if replying to something else written - not what I actually write) Further - electronic £££ created by private banks is specifically *not* QE, nothing to do with it. If the scheme of the fiat system presented in the video is correct. And from everything I've seen and read on the topic - I think it is correct.<br>

IDK what you mean tbh. The £££ cash is ink printed on paper. The electronic £££ that circulate between the reserve accounts is numbers in a spreadsheet (or an SQL table). What else can it possibly be? It's literally the job of the BoE to do this. None of this is news.<br>

... afaik those accounts are bank's reserve accounts with BoE, say call them the "reserve account" if you will (after the us banks accounts with the federal reserve bank), and they are not "lent out". Further - it's legally impossible to be lent out as I understand it. Further - it's logically incoherent: in the GFC'08 banks lent too much (on housing), then suffered losses. So it's reasonable and prudent for a bank to want to reduce risk. And "lending out" is increasing risk, not reducing it. Further - banks creating loans is not directly tied to their reserve account (it's tied indirectly vie the risk as I vaguely understand it). Further - post GFC'08 economy in crisis no-one buying stuff: there are takers to take loans from a bank to invest to create stuff, b/c there is noone to sell that stuff to really. The consumption of everything collapsed. So QE is going to help the real economy is incoherent on many levels afaics.<br>

Yes, so that's the original point: the person creating the original image committed those plethora of offenses. The person viewing the image, in the process of viewing, re-created the image but didn't commit the same offenses (prob committed others, somewhat different, offenses). I guess the law could have made a difference between the original image, and copies of it being re-creations of the same image. And maybe it does - IDK anything abt the law tbh.<br>

Big improvement - no? Previously we expected models to be real, and there was an issue when they were retouched and not real. People tried to use real people non-retouched - with mixed results. Now, technology to the rescue: there will not be the expectation that the models are real - going forward, everyone will know the models used are not real. Problem solved? Don't recall anyone ever suggesting this solution to the societal problem (=people expecting real models but getting non-real ones): keeping the models non-real, but changing people's expectations! haha - excellent :-)<br>

I think it like this. The ideal is deterministic knowledge. Like in physics: we know exactly what's going to happen. However - that kind of knowing is an exception, not the rule. For most things, we are ignorant, we guess wrongly the future outcome. We simply don't know. Do we then give up and say "well anything may happen"? Not so fast - we can do a bit better than that. We can count and tally the outcomes. In a circle of 10 friends, I can't know who is going to get cancer, and who is not, but I can count how many of us get it in the next 10yrs - say 3 of us. But I can't know which one of us individually. That's weaker knowledge than the deterministic one. I only know the total count - not the outcome of each and every one experiment. Note at deterministic knowledge I knew each outcome (so trivialy easy to count and tally them too). Statistics is a way to quantify our ignorance. Not ideal, far from it - but better than giving up completely. Note in the extreme when we have outcomes tally, say option A=100%, option B=0% - we just crossed over to deterministic knowing. From statistical ignorance, over to deterministic knowledge, if you like. 😁<br>

I do not wish them harm. I despair at their choices. By preferencing themselves over their children - they did their children harm, and then subsequently they did themselves harm too.

Heh - welcome to the club. Then thinks of what that does to stats that usually go after a central measure as representative. 🤯 The space moves in the edges. There is no probability mass left away from all edges. In sufficient high N-dim every point is a outlier. Heck - maybe that's how discreteness emerges from a continuoum for all we know.<br>

Wow! Thanks! Love that - could live there. If the build-build-build YIMBY thing gets traction and London density increases, encasing tall buildings in trees one way or another becomes a must. Otherwise - an average big building is usually ugly enough for people to try avoid them if they possibly can. No matter what the architects and the builders claim - revealed preferences are pretty clear afaict.<br>

Yes, in the world of politics - and in every area that needs interaction between two humans, so a different opinions on "what should we do now" needs to be reconciled somehow - there is almost universally a rank. Ills of collectivism - sure, but we congregate together b/c we are incapable to sustain our own life left to our own devices, right? Every day, in order to stay alive - e.g. get water, food, shelter, warmth etc - I use the results of a cooperation network of humans that stretches across not only geographic area (ultimately - the whole Earth) but also across time (ultimately - from the down of humanity). We pay a price for that in reduction of our individual freedom. Fwiw the two modes of interaction are cooperation and competition. So resolving differences via rank is not strictly necessary I think. Not sure exactly why it emerges in every human group. Maybe it's low cost way of resolving the differences - IDK really why.<br>

The gap may widen on relative measures. Some care about relative ranks - but they should not care. On absolute measures - which is what really counts - technology empowers the individual, makes him less dependent on other people around him, so enhances individual freedom.<br>

Every organization or company is beholden one way or another to whomever is paying the bills. Best if there is approx equal share of various stake holders (advertisers, subscribers etc) so to be able to resist pressure from whichever direction it may come.

Władysław Franciszek Jabłonowski. Wish this was thought in schools -<br>
During the Haitian Revolution, French forces, which included Polish soldiers, were sent to suppress the uprising. However, when Jabłonowski and his men heard the Haitian army singing "La Marseillaise," the French revolutionary anthem, it resonated with their own struggle for freedom and independence. Recognizing the Haitian fight for liberty as akin to their own national struggle, Jabłonowski and his soldiers decided to switch sides and support the Haitian cause against the French. (ChatGPT)<br>

Ofc. Consumption is going to increase manyfold. China becoming 1/2 as rich as US => double current GDP (=consumption).

There is neurological drive: we dislike & are disturbed at seeing gruesome acts, we feel discomfort in lieu of pain when we seed bad things done to other people (c.f. mirror neurons).<br>
The economy of neo/liberalism - I hear you, but this is about the morality of non-religious humanism.<br>
Many people think religion is necessary for groups formation and forming societies out of disparate units - individuals. I thought @sapinker<br>
 argued convincingly his position: all it takes is to acknowledge "I am not the center of Universe" but "all humans are born equal" i.e. "your interests are as good as mine". And on that idea of reciprocity, one can build the rest of morality. No God required for that. B/c going back in time to religion and God-worshiping is it seems to me impossible for us. What's seen, can't be unseen. Once learned, we can't unlearn stuff we know, and that prevents us from telling ourselves and believing comfortable stories our predecessors had at their disposal.<br>

This is very good by @sapinker and @KonstantinKisin and @francisjfoster on @triggerpod (disregard the not-so-clever title) on the basis for secular morality -<br>
https://youtube.com/watch?v=wJaWnHzvERw&t=3000s<br>
For everyone thinking that the past and religion is to look at for moral guidance: would you be a more moral person if you were to be more like the Taliban in Afghanistan? Starting with "we are all created equal" as basis for our morality is sufficient. It leads to not privileging my interests over anyone else's, assuming other person's interests are as legitimate as are mine.<br>
Downstream from it - we get the golden rule (do to others what you want done to yourself), the silver rule (don't do to others what you don't want to be done to you), utilitarianism (greatest good to greatest number of people), universalizing the maxim of your actions (what if everyone did as you do), the veil of ignorance (rules devised without regard to the status of the person they apply to).<br>

I can't follow more accounts atm. IDK how many did I follow today. When I'm told "you can't follow this acc b/c you reached a limit", how about spelling out: "... b/c you already followed XX more accounts today, which is your current limit". I'm sure it's more difficult to implement that, than a simple "NO". But it feels so much better - oh you X developers - when you do a good job of your job, v.s. when you do a poor job at it.<br>

It's a single text file. I edit in vim - so for me it sitting on a say 2 line entry on thei 1st line - it is 2dd or d} to cut, then search with /^DONE, then p to paste. This to move it from TODO->to DONE. Also I start entries with "- " so to search easily with /^- .<br>

Once seen - can't be unseen. The religion and God as imagined in Christianity - can't genuinely come back in that form. They are dead. There is plenty God-like material in science, probably most in physics. So with some helping hand from phylosophy we are probably in the process of getting the next religion-like ideology as we speak.<br>

+1 for the stress test 😄 - a good point. Hope  the system holds, whichever way the election goes. Fwiw didn't think Kamala was in any way more or less "approved" than Trump was. There is a reason independents rarely win. Electors favor party candidates, the evidence is overwhelming. The party apparatus is the people actually putting in the work months and years of it - unlike myself just a rando spending 30 mins reading abt it while enjoying a summer day in the garden. 😆<br>

Ofc! And does MMT say otherwise?? No it does not! It says exactly that: the money is not an issue, how and what services and goods we produce, to purchase with any (or none) money we create daily - is the big deal. By mystifying the money part of the money-for-stuff exchange, we exhaust our energies and time on the trivial part - the money: ==a piece of paper, a half of a stick broke in halves, a cell in an Excel spreadsheet, an entry in a BTC ledger. So we engage in a displacement activity and we never get to the actual point - the stuff, the services we all crave: how are we to actually make the stuff, provide said services. It's intensely annoying that we spend time on this, I'm annoyed as I'm writing this tbh.<br>

Thanks! Will seek it out. I read some of Gulag Archipelago while in the army (!!) as 18yo doing national service in a socialist country. My superiors (two career army officers in charge of writing a new version of Artillery Manual or sth; I was IT support) were reading it and discussing it, so I got interested. This was 1987, a socialist but non-aligned country not part of SU nor of the Eastern block. (does not exist any more; YU)<br>

Absent desktop app, absent multi-view App (so in the end the web experience is superior to the App), Xpro being dog slow as to be painful to type - all this is testament to the power of social ("I'm here b/c everyone else is") so we put up with any amount of sh*t just to post here.<br>

To win in the UK, MMT have to win in the US 1st. UK will accept the reality & move onto things that really matter - i.e. how do we create produce stuff we want, the stuff that the £££ buys - once MMT heresy becomes accepted knowledge in the US.

Great! - you are an MMT-er then! B/c it seems to me it's  concerned with "printing the money". It's literally describing how we print money daily. Nothing to do what we use that money to buy , how's that other stuff we buy produced etc - just the money creating part.<br>

Too bad Gulag Archipelago is too dense to slog through for most of us, and there have not been any good or interesting movies or TV adaptation for mass consumption. So it remains under-appreciated, what disaster communism was wherever tried. And oh boy was it tried in various geographies, culture, times - and failed, universally. Solzhenitsyn being religious nationalist didn't help making his opus more appealing to the average liberal in charge of light entertainment either. Missed chances all around.<br>

Possible. My adult life experience has been - assume the worst, and you will be more right than wrong. Is that one guy truly exceptionally good in all other ways so to take the risk of ending in a position of "last meaningful elections"?? Looking at guys like Turkey, or Russia, or China, or Hungary even: they have to wait for the dear leader to die, to see any chance of a meaningful change. Democracies changing parties and or leaders in power think they have it bad with inefficiency and craziness and corruption of power. Can you imagine the levels of bad if the same guy is in power for half a century?? Few people can imagine, most of us we lack that much imagination. One has to live it to believe it tbh.<br>

And now we know - leaving RAAC danger of concrete falling on UK school kids heads. I blame the vanity of the average public figure - style of substance gets the better of them every single time.

I am with @OctopusEnergy . We the consumers have been paying the highest bills in history recently. Doubling of consumer bills is a big factor in falling of living standards. Energy is input into everything else - so its high cost contributes even more than our bills. What's your plan for more abundant and cheaper energy? Atm renewables are at ATH in our energy mix, and our bills are at ATH. The direction of travel is the wrong way there. I'm fortunate enough to have been able to invest 10k+ in rooftop solar+battery to about halve my electricity bill. Most people in the UK lack that option. You must work towards making energy cheaper and more abundant for all. Have not heard much abt that tbh.<br>

Solutionism, figuring out solutions to problems. Usually via technology and upstream from it science. Currently looks like solar, wind, batteries, nuclear are going to take care of zero carbon electricity. So that's great, as also upstream from it - electrify everything we possibly can is good. Societal challenges - best see what worked elsewhere, try implement some of it here. Like US doing best in developed countries recently - learn from Budenomics, try apply some. China among developing countries doing great for a long time - learn from that, apply as appropriate. In Europe - there's Poland doing as well as China from a higher baseline - apply some to eurepean context as more appropriate. Also learn from mistakes - Germany lagging, EU anti-science anti-technology bad, UK Brexit creating barriers to trade frictions for all, WEU-Germany Russia bet on trade and cooperatiin going bad.<br>

Vo UK, kolku zarabotila i potrosila mojata firma, toa e javno - ima registar na firmi, sekoj moze da vidi pdf od zavrsna smetka, i za sekoja godina prijaven profit (na koj plakam danok). Privatni firmi gledaat se z mene - mojata banka znae kolku mi se prihodi i rashodi i za sto, Amazon znae sto kupuvam, sto filmovi gledam i sl, FB-X-Google gledaat sto gledam jas na ekran (posto tie mi go serviraat), Google znae kade patuvam (preku Gmail, Gmaps) i t.n. Nema 100% privatnost nikade (valjda - samo ako  ziveam vo pestera, jadam bobinki i pijam voda od izvorce; i ne komuniciram so nikogo), prasanje na dogovor na graganite vo opstestvoto e - kolku e javno, kolku e tajno.

That they can produce coherent sentence - is surprising. That can can hold a dialog, an actual conversation - is amazing. That I can speak in voice to ChatGPT App, and it speaks back to me, in an obscure language, and what it says is better - cleverer, more polite, more thoughtful - than 99% of humans - is beyond my wildest expectations. 🤯 Science Fiction made reality.

Informacii protekuvaat celo vreme, nesto tocni nesto lazni, probuvam da drzam nesto pod kontrola, polovicno uspevam polovicno ne; C) 99% javnost - radikalna transparentnost, sekoj kompjuter na vlada i na drzavna administracija, se sto e pod gov dot mk zapisuva dokumenti samo i ekskluzivno na mrezen delen disk M: do koj ima pristap sekoj graganin na MK (kompjuterite nemaat lokalen disk, sekoj USB port e zatnat so lepak etc). Jas se nadevam deka varijanta C) ke raboti podobro od varijanta B). Ama se plasam deka ne e taka, deka varijanta B) dava podob rezultat od C).

Possible, entirely possible. Possible the other way too: impact is minimised, so we get surprised when measured. That's why we don't trust 100% any single study or anything really - it's always balances of probabilities. One study is not a big deal. Results need to be replicated multiple times, by multiple people, in multiple places, using multiple methodologies, etc. Given how big and productive cities are: would expect them to have good continuous monitoring infrastructure, so not to rely on one-off studies. That'd be handy so to be able to conduct public policy small scale experiments and measure their outcomes.<br>

My impression is that study after study on the influence of air pollution (esp in cities) gets surprised by the size of the effect, how much more bad air affects bad health than we expect. Wonder if it's to do with the fact that we can't see it, so out of sight - out of mind.<br>

The ones I personally have known - it's was a variant of cope. They were hoping that there is some benevolent overwhelming force controlling things. It's not all random events swirling about with 1000s of actors/groups pulling in all directions. When the force or benevolence fail to materialize, things go to sh*t (in my case - civil wars, dissolution of the state, obv criminals getting the upper hand running things) I've seen rationalizations: 1) it was not benevolent, evil forces took control (majority); 2) (minority) the good guys have not gotten the signal, they are sitting in a secret underground base waiting for for the command to save us (after a while - there is no one on the good side left with authority to issue the command). On a major level - it's lazy and head-in-sand silly refusing to acknowledge the precariousness of our lives (plus - excusing inaction so no effort to do sth against the entropy engulfing us). On a minor level - it's touching, a bit child-like in the helplessness and also in the belief that things are to be good and well by default.<br>

Yeah it's tad self serving: "I am a member of an elite that failed, but hey, don't blame us personally - anyone in our position would've failed too". While not great, in itself does not make the arguments invalid. But shocking to me, it managed through the whole series without defining what "information" and "knowledge" is. Starting with the title, "Ignorance" - well, we have excellent means to write down our ignorance, the degrees and the quantity of it - using the probability theory. Then there are hard definitions for "information" and "knowledge" since 1948. There is a unit of information ("bit"), the same way there is a unit of mass, or electric charge. Then there are extensions all the way to present time (incl "decisions under uncertainty" etc) that current AI crop (and its predecessors) were built on. This seems to be not known to @RoryStewartUK ?? Once one googles or spends time with Chatgpt learning on "Shannon Information theory", many things mentioned, wondered and mused on in this series - become less of a wonder. I don't know what to say, except that CP Snow's "The Two Cultures" problem is well alive and kicking. Esp given this whole series went through an entire process so it's not a single person single time fail - it's a larger group of people and over some considerable time.<br>

:-) Yeah, different experiences. Forms filling - I'm filling some on gov dot uk rn, I have to fill in the address, but I'd don't have to prove it them it's that address. Immigration - yeah that's always been between bad and diabolical. That seems to be the case for many countries, almost universal. I imagine bureaucrat dealing with citizens of his own country, where they are nuisance as they create work for him. But at least these are his compatriots, he feels some affinity with them. Now I imagine the same - but without the person on the other side being a citizen. There is zero incentive to be competent and nice (apart from the inner motivation - "I prefer to do a good job, detest doing a poor job"), and the system also does not care much about non-citizens, it's between indifferent and hostile.<br>

But monopolies naturally occur in true free markets, no? The end game in any free market, where anti-monopoly laws are not enforced, is a monopoly (in practice an oligopoly or a cartel shortly before). That's one stable configuration. The other stable configuration (with vigorous competition) is profit  tending towards zero. Companies see and feel the latter, so they - not unreasonably - make sure to end in the former. In a setup with a positive feedback loop where big becomes bigger (and the small smaller, relatively), and where anti-monopoly law does not disallow M&A - don't see a different end game. US has run that experiment since Bork, and in every industry got the same result.<br>

Is part of the current stasis the need for a re-election? Would more of them do what they think "is right" if they didn't have to think of re-election? If one is a professional politician, than one must think of re-election. If it's a one-off job - then maybe the role will be closer to the Member of Parliament role as we idealize it: taking into account - his own thoughts and ideas, the desires of the constituents, the interests of the country, the party, and reconciling everything with own conscience, to speak up, vote and do other work in parliament (committees and the like). It bothers me that there seem to be a lot of ex-politicians, that go in media (incl social) once not seeking re-election, in the mode of: now I can finally freely speak up my mind. Dudes!!  - we voted for you hoping you speak your minds while MPs!<br>

Proof of age - yes, more difficult without universal ID. Filling forms - IDK what difference it makes, atm I put my name, surname, home address, seems to suffice. Where state money is involved (tax etc) I have national insurance number, that suffices for that purpose. Police anecdote - I use it as an example of a more general state of affairs, that it seems to me, is opposite in my home ctry UK compared to my ctry of birth MK: in MK bureaucracy distrusts me by default, and I have to bring in evidence from a trusted 3rd party; in UK the bureaucracy trusts me bu default.<br>

Yeah - we don't have a good word for it. It's not like terrorism in that it does not kill citizens to instill fear. It does make life somewhat difficult for citizens, so that citizens put pressure on the elected gov. IDK if it can ever succeed, given the length of the transmission mechanism to an actual meaningful gov action. It does work like a PR stunt raising awareness so the media blabber about it for a day-two.<br>

Layers of rules, but excellence and quality were apparently no ones top of the list. So they drop down the list of priorities. I guess if the system is excellent, it gets forgotten that's not god given natural state of affairs, it doesn't just happen on its own.<br>

Sure - just a personal sample of 1, and only dealing with the state burocracy. Putting the responsibility to ID on the other foot has been liberating. Yeah tyranny of the majority over the individual is something to be mindful of, but in the other direction there is the one rotten apple that spoils the entire barrel to be mindful of too.<br>

Indeed it would be. But all market players (banks, agents, existing owners) but one (first time buyers) earn more, the more the prices rise. One paper I remember seeing many years ago, computing the sensitivity of house price increases to number of factors, had "mortgage credit availability" be the strongest factor, stronger x5 times or so than the 2nd strongest.<br>

My pet thesis is that in tge English-speaking world, the citizens are trusted by default. We just say it how it is - and that suffices. In the continental systems it seems to me the citizen is untrusted by default, his/her word carries very little weight. A trusted third party has to communicate with the official and be that trusted source. The medium has to be paper so there is a paper trail, should the official himself have to prove to its supervisor to have done things correctly.<br>

I think you are right - but pro-free traders have to ask themselves: why does the cycle repeat? Why do our policies by the end (of a cycle) become so unpopular? Unpopular is simply - the losers outnumber the winners. I personally think they concentrate too much on the mean (average growth), and not enough on the dispersion around that mean (the  distribution of that growth). Did not think it's that hard to keep track of 2 numbers rather than single 1 - but I'm not an economist.<br>

Usually someone brings US Monroe doctrine. Imo where US pursued it more - it was a big disaster (civil wars in Central America), where pursued less (military juntas in South America) - it was a disaster, and where not pursued (Cuba) - it was the least bad option. UN charter modeled after WW2 along the lines of "... to initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime;  it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war  crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the  whole" seems to me stood the test of time.<br>

Liberalism puts the individual first. If I am "me myself and I first" all my life, I am not going to change overnight at my death bed. All liberals come over as somewhat egotistical to outsiders (outside of that ideology). Fwiw US both sides seem liberal when viewed by an outsider. It's but impossible to perceive that for an USain. That's the ideology, permeating  all US life implicitly by default, the "unknown knowns", this is like what water would be to fish.<br>

Sure - people that do the voting, members of the the party, are softie cowards. As we all are  b4 we are put in a position that demands courage (and only then we find out). But they still want to have a brave leader at the helm - not unreasonably so. Signalling is easy and cost free for a 10p - maybe coward maybe hero - and enough gullible members will be swayed so to tilt the odds and get the trickster over the line. That's why it's done - it's fake, but it's useful. Tories were supposed to be better than that, hard nosed enough as not to be taken for a ride - but maybe not the boomers generation. TBS<br>

😂😂 I feel for you. Kids had three passport in three different alphabets (Latin, Greek, Cyrillic). At some point a passport office decides "all transliterations to Latin must match between them". And if they don't - Q: what's to be done, what's the  solution? A: Go to the state issuing the other passport, change the name by deed poll in the native script to a variant, that when transliterated to Latin, matches the name as written in the passport with Latin script only. 😂😂 An actual civil servant wrote this in a letter, as legal advice - what to do next.

Solutions - he proposed 5. Interesting - not looking for that, boring is fine with me, only need to work. Insights - IDK anything about the mechanics of governing, with @Dominic2306<br>
 a rare ex-political operator to speak openly abt that. Not bright - fine with me, we shouldn't need geniuses for MP-s, if the system relied on needing Einstein as MP then we'd be in real trouble. Well connected - that seems true, but doesn't disqualify him (nor qualify; but sure explains). Useful foil/idiod - yeah you can say that in a sense of "if you have at least 1 principle a person with 0 principles can always out-lie, out-deceive you". IDK if it's a good strategy for us voters to seek to be deceived by serial liars - seems tad inadequate. No follower base - that's fine with me, I'm not looking for a leader so to join his followers. I am interested to find out abt that world (politics) b/c in general I'm interested how all things work. The size of his following is irrelevant for that.<br>

Me too, so I stick to easy mode. My front door light bulb draws 50W power (as written on it). Kept on for 20h, that'll be 50W x 20h = (5x2) 0 0 Wxh = 10 0 0 Wh = 1000 Wh. Then I remember K is just short hand for 1000, for 3 0s, 1000 of Anything=1K of Anything, so 1000Wh=1KWh. And I remember 1kWh costs about ~30 pence, from looking at the electricity bills.<br>

Sure - that's an argument for "let's not turn Earth into Moon". Not an argument for "let's not turn Moon into Earth". We can't ruin Moon any more than it's ruined now - wouldn't you agree? Humans are typically capable of doing rang of things. In fact - it's never a single thing that's done, it's multitudes, at the same time. There is no good argument for "let's not do X b/c something else unrelated Y needs doing".<br>

Knowledge equals zero Ignorance, which is unattainable for us. So, in our world, only varying degrees of Ignorance exist. Omitting statistics — our primary tool for modeling and understanding Ignorance — is a major downer.<br>
Statistics then probability naturally leads to Information Theory. Google Shannon Information Theory. It provides hard definitions of information and downstream from it knowledge. Amusingly in that framework it can be seen how observing additional information can decrease knowledge.<br>
This isn’t just academic mumbo-jumbo. It's the foundation of all AI and ML. If it were wrong, none of our current AI systems would work.<br>

The operative word being "currently". :-) Yes - it's not feasible atm, yes it's absurdly expensive atm. But look at how the prices are moving, look at California (where the future is playing out at ~1yr lag in advance of say London). I myself wd not dare to predict "centuries away". 😆 For technology has a knack of making many a person - persons much smarter and knowledgeable than myself! - forecast abt the future look foolish. 😂 But only in retrospect... 😇<br>

It will, and will cost a lot to start with. It's better to be honest with the customers footing the bills (us!): new technology is expensive, there is no other way. Your electricity bills will go up. People notice that anyways - bills increasing in lockstep with the fraction of RE in our energy mix increasing. This politicians find hard to do. They think "how do I tell the truth and be elected", and I'm thinking "you were elected already, now tell your electorate the truth and don't assume a reelection".<br>

Network level storage is going from strength to strength, the progress has been amazing above anyone's expectations, but it's not there yet. We can't just switch off the gas turbines backups - not yet! Yes - it's expensive so it will be deployed at scale in the rich parts of the world, e.g. California. Yes - it's plain stupid to be switching off perfectly fine nuclear plants, that's inexcusable. Many things can be true (and false) at once. Atm storage wise I'm aware of: California is flattening the intraday solar "duck curve" (google it), grid operators using storage to maintain frequency stability (a big gain; ignore details - just trust operators when they say "whoa - well this works, excellent" by doing it), Hawaii relied too much too early on storage (turned off some coal plant too soon) and suffered blackouts during some extreme weather induced outages couple of months ago.<br>

Cool that's fine - I'm not either, most people aren't. Fortunately to "get" most of the debate, be grounded, not be misled by language flourishes & metaphors, we just need a tiny bit of basic knowledge. For the grid that tiny bit is "Total supply == Total demand, at all times".<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
Sure, storage is useful and used - when there is excess supply, it can be stored (if the supply can't be dialed down), when there is excess demand, the storage gives back the energy (regardless if battery or reversible hydro or ...). But there is not running away from "Total supply == total demand" - the storage is actually working to achieve that on either side of that equal == sign.<br>

Sure, and I have some at home. And with the battery storage at scale costs dropping, c.f. California deployment, daily "duck shape" leveling etc. Still - that does not contradict what I wrote - at all times it must be "Total supply == Total demand". There is no other way.<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
For the purposes of statistics - yes. But there is not getting away from that every second of every day it must be "Total supply == Total demand". There is no other way. If in the next 10 mins wind supply drops to 0, the demand (the customers) must be turned off, or new supply must be turned on (of whatever designation). Otherwise - the frequency and or the voltage in the network will drop and devices connected to it will be ruined (unless protected). To avoid damage, as a means of last resort, if the demand outstrips supply - the grid operator disconnects customers until balance is reached again. There is no other way.<br>

Majority of the energy of that impulse was spent on attacking the FPTP system. Minority leaked towards attacking the Postal vote. They got some red meat thrown at them previously with Voter ID.

Extremes are compared b/c on our side his examples are monopolies - Excel spreadsheets & Boeing planes crashing etc. There is an argument about financialisation - a measure/ment becoming sole desired outcome supplanting all others. We are not looking for the baker and the butcher to become fabulously rich and powerful - we want them to keep providing the bread and the meat.

As individuals if we could drum into every child "tolerance is the price we pay to live in free society" (and some counter example like - unfree society may appear pleasant but only b/c people hold back what they express in a free society) that would be great. Society wise - there is a lot out there about the individual, and imo comparatively little about the teams, the groups of people that operate in society. It's rare that one lone individual is impactful, more often it's a team of people that make the impact.<br>

Yeah this is bigger than Ukr now. Until the invasion it was Ukr only. EU leaders (and US - but US cared less) tried to contain it to stay Ukr only, by appeasement (c.f. continuing the energy dependency and sending hundreds of billions of euros to Russia for the gas), and that was not unreasonable to hope for. It pains me to think it and say it (have two 20yo boys) that we maybe on the slope to WW3, even if it's not possible for us to be certain. Same as people in Oct-1939 wouldn't know they are in WW2. Looking forward - I see no other way to deter Russia but East Europe states (Poland + Baltics foremost) acquiring own nuclear deterrent. Russia thinks that US would rather let go of them like with Yalta 1945. I am not so sure. Maybe US would have sacrificed the Baltics prior to Finland joining NATO. Not sure if that's true now, and not sure it was ever true for Poland. But the only way to deter Russia from testing US (which may end very badly for humanity indeed), is for the EEurope states to get their own A-bombs. Once they don't rely on US, Russia knows for sure they will strike her back should she strike them first. Old argument that non-nuclear Ukr is going to tempt Rus that was shown prescient - https://mearsheimer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mearsheimer-Case-for-Ukrainian-Nuclear-Deterrent.pdf . One can see the same logic of "smaller state menaced by much bigger neighbor(s)" at work in Israel v.v. Arab neighbor states, North Korea v.v. its neighbors incl Japan (and US).<br>

Yep - judging him on the actions, taking over Crimea and parts of Eastern Ukraine in 2014, invasion in 2022. That @DAlperovitch pre-invasion thread enumerates Putin/Russia considerations well. It's comforting to think events are in UK hands, that UK decides this or that - but the reality is that we don't.<br>

Not no one though, right? Putin knew it to be an invasion, and ~6 months before Feb too. Other exceptions - Arestovych, and Alperovitch here https://x.com/DAlperovitch/status/1473362460673515527 . Wars don't happen by accident, lots of planning and effort goes into them.<br>
> I understand it does not seem logical to you. It's not logical to me either. But remember - the 2022 invasion did not make sense to us either. We are committing the fallacy of assuming everyone's logic is the same as ours. It's not. Underneath that logic lie values, what we hold dear, and what we don't care about. Start with different values, work your way up to the logic, and you will see a different logic to ours emerge.<br>

In the last few weeks, I have become increasingly convinced that Kremlin has unfortunately made a decision to invade Ukraine later this winter. While it is still possible for Putin to deescalate, I believe the likelihood is now quite low. Allow me to explain why 🧵<br>

Putin speeches and writings transcribed and translated for us on kremlin ru, the propaganda 24/7 conditioning the population, economy on war footing, takeover of the remaining not-pro-putin pockets (killing off the last of the opposition, control of Internet, culture etc), Putin's 1st echelon of leftenants (Medvedev etc) drumming war messages day and night (and inc the Baltics and Poland in them), the logic of a continental empire (more land is better, little else matters), the history of Russia imperial expansion from the 18th cent.<br>

Peace settlement is possible if both sides want peace more than war. Forcing UKR to capitulate while RUS pursues war still is ofc bad for Ukrs, but may turn out to be bad for us in the UK too. All indicators point that RUS will continue to Moldova and the Bactics, possibly finally reaching Poland.<br>

There is a risk in doing, but also as risk in not doing too. To claim with abs certainty to know what would lead to not/escalation is to claim to have a crystal ball, or a solution that escaped both Chamberlain and Churchill. From 2014 the West pursued a policy of appeasement. That road brought Europe to the 2022 invasion moment. To zig-zag and pursue different policy since does not strike me as insane. Ultimately peace needs two sides, while for war one side suffices. Russia decided to pursue war so war is what we got. 120M East Europeans need to level the field and acquire independent nuclear deterrent. Until then Russia will keep attacking them as those wars she can't lose: at worst it's a draw for RU, and with luck they may even win some.<br>

Important enough to be worth repeating: on the flip side of liberalism is tolerance. If everyone is plenty free to express themselves, then there will be plenty out there I disprove of, and even offends me. I should tolerate it - not like it, not be fond of it, just tolerate it. Hand-in-hand with freedom, comes the need for tolerance. That we are to tolerate stuff we personally dislike got reminded in https://youtube.com/watch?v=yZbR7HE_ER8&feature=youtu.be (by @FukuyamaFrancis and John Grey; and ok do draw a line someplace, pos at don't "tolerate the intolerant" - it's a high enough bar) Reminded me of  @demishassabis I heard say: if UK had tolerated Alan Turing rather than hounding him, maybe Silicon Valley would be located in Manchester now.<br>

Power they misused badly and never did anything to put those wrong right. "Fixing the roof while the sun shines" is not just a figure of speech. You were supposed to sell bonds at 0% and fix the roofs of all the schools throughout the UK. Instead - you left them to rot so nowadays our kids are in danger of concrete falling on their heads. So that's exactly the opposite of fixing - it is NOT fixing. ELI5 to you as we know you are a bare faced lair! Yeah - you saddled my kids with debt that is atm an extra tax but just sitting there waiting to be weaponized against them by some future slimeclegg.<br>

Coming from a startup country myself (started 1945, finalized independent 1991, 🇲🇰💖) and considering talk of startup societies ex-Earth, it'd be great to see work on startup societies, esp empirical designed controlled  experiments that are sorely lacking.<br>

That may well be - and ofc it's trivially true as the Earth and all on it will stop existing on some day in a distant future - but: given the record of all previous prophets of doom (==fail; hence us posting here), is there maybe not a tiny tinge of doubt in your mind? That you maybe mistaken about an impending doom? B/c you don't put a date to your forecast, I presume it's impending doom that bears on your mind. In 10B years - yeah, the Earth will be gone and all life (incl poss humanity) with it.<br>

Excellent idea! I always thought the "startup societies" libertarian wing was this, with startup cities as a 1st step. Exactly this - empirical evidence from real experiments by design - sorely needed in the field. Atm all R & D & knowledge acquisition relies on accidental experiments afaics<br>

I'd say propensity for reading X post->web link->jump to web page is so high, that X being outside the browser is always friction enough for me that I always go back to the browser in the end.<br>
XPro - I used it ages ago as tweetdeck, enough to create nice personalized experience I really liked with 1-deck-per-1-list, 1 deck with Lists, 1 deck Personal and so on (like so - attached), and even subscribed to Premium b/c of it, but over time just me being sloppy and XPro decks being very slow it fell into disuse. Been spending more time on  X lately so rediscovered XPro, loving it 🥰 enough to be putting up with sluggishness (even typing this on a 10 core 128gb ram box in FF is a bit painful) for the time being. Maybe this was more feedback than one hoped for 😆😆 - apology for taxing the attention.<br>

Yeah - maybe have it optional, like one of the Lists tabs that I can opt to put on the top of the screen (or not)? Actually - maybe the effect can be achieved via Lists already, like I define a list to be "accounts where we both follow each other"? Or a Deck in XPro?<br>

Genuine answer: I don't think think everything that others do is directly to do with Russia. Some of it is - yes, but not everything. IDK what other's think - but I presume it maybe similar.<br>
Genuine question: why do you yourself personally think you can deduce 1) what I think 2) what others think, from a post that does not say anything of the sort?<br>
Like, there is a difference between: none- meaning zero, not even one; some - meaning at least one but possibly more and even all; at least one - same as previous; all - meaning completely 100% no exceptions. In your thoughts - does  the above make any sense? Or is it simply confusing gibberish?<br>

Rationale: the chance that a user finds kindred-enough spirit so to be interested in their posts is 1e-8. I'm after those ultra-rare interactions, they are valuable to me. The Followtoo would double that SNR again (1e-16). The value of the network is in the connections, this is easy enough to implement - justdoit? ;-)<br>

Oft where there is a longer thread back-and-forth of half dozen people multiple exchanges, I find it easy to lose track of all the replies in the multitude of reply-to-reply-to-... I rely on notifications to keep track, but some turn off notifications, others filter them out etc. I wonder if there is a way for 1) the sender of a reply to see, if 2) the accounts mentioned in the reply specifically, have 3) received 4) seen the reply post? Like there is say in WhatsApp group discussion where one can see if 1) all participants in the chat have seen the message 2) can click on the message and then see what accounts 3) it was delivered to (but not et seen) 4) delivered and seen too.<br>

Maybe use library or wrappers that provide goodies and make your life easier instead of calling libc functions directly. E.g. instead of calloc filling 0s, have the allocator fill with a bit pattern, free fill it with different pattern etc. So one look at a memory block, and you know if alloced/freed.<br>

Too much carrot, not enough stick in the NIMBY lands. Not suggesting we cut them off the national grid, but how about we just ignore them until their numbers grow significantly? Start paying attention when the 4 become 84 MPs, but not before that. Allowing minority interests to capture our institutions and processes is a recipe for paralysis.

As life expectancy increases, should society consider upper age limits (e.g., 80 years old) for certain activities? We're accustomed to lower age limits (e.g., 18 or 21 years old) for various responsibilities, and there are already upper limits and conditions on activities like driving. Could similar considerations be applied elsewhere to balance safety, fairness, and the valuable contributions of older adults?<br>

A 3rd possibility: Starmer sorts out the boats quickly ends asylum chaos and legal immigration comes down too, and voters are "well things are moving in the right direction" in 5yrs time.

Even more - in democracy politics reacts to the electorate, the voters get *promised* what politicians think voters want. So part of the fix is for the voters to demand more realistic things (and not in "be realistic, demand the impossible" way, haha 😂), as opposed to say voting the realist out, and voting the clowns ("we will have our cake and eat it") in. That's why he is reticent about solutions and has to be nudged couple of times by the hosts to spell it out. Also that's why any fix is very hard. It involves the electorate being better, smarter. You see how that message is received by the electorate in the replies below. Not with eruptions of joy, haha 😂😂<br>

It was your punchiest-for-the-time-taken, highest SNR interview when it comes to talking abt solutions. He spoke softly but what was said packed a punch. Problems listing is easy, such rent a mouths are two a penny. Did I imagine or did you get tad subdued once he heeded your encouragement, spilled out the beans and we  heard from the horses' mouth that UK travails are not just the case of "a few bad man"? (alt: you got tired and or bored 😆) And that the next lot will likely not achieve much more? That it was not for lack of trying or for lack of quality people that CON-s failed so comprehensively? And ultimately it's us the electorate that have to raise our game but that's a very tall order.<br>

Lest we forget... 😂😂 Just listened to the @RoryStewartUK @triggerpod interview discussing blind spots. Yes, markets work great, and we should use them wherever we can. No, unfortunately, it's not a universally available solution (wish it were!). Markets aren't present everywhere, and creating them is hard. Where there's no price signal to feedback into supply increase, or where supply is constricted for other reasons, the negative feedback price signal exists, but no supply increase happens.<br>

Strictly speaking USA invasion was "the supreme international crime" but not an imperial war of conquest, ruling Iraq forever was not in any of the USA plans afaik.<br>
Strictly speaking RUS invasion of UKR is even more than  an imperial war of conquest (in addition to being "the supreme international crime"), as RUS aim is to erase UKR identity, extinguish UKR language and culture. Something that not even the Bolsheviks aimed for from 1920 in the Soviet Union.<br>

Thanks for sharing! I wondered about that lately. With 1) the increases home of electricity price 2) increase of charge power i.e. faster charge time that home charger can't provide so one must use charge point - I was wondering how pricing looks these days compared to ICE. In the beginning with home charging EV had x5-x6 times the price advantage, it was that much cheaper. So now it's reached parity? That's bad news.<br>

Yes - but will ID-cards introduction increase the police harassment? Given we already get by with no national mandated ID card - should we bother with it? There are pros- and cons-, the non-technical arg I most weight is: it changes fundamentally the relationship between the individual and the state. Atm I can't get into trouble by doing nothing,(*) I can't break the law by inaction. Obligatory ID card changes that: now by doing nothing I'm suspect even criminal, I have to actively do something (present ID, prove my identity) in order to stay on the right side of the law.<br>
(*) the introduction of SORN was the 1st time that - very good - rule got broken in the UK afaik<br>

The most convincing study I've seen ages ago (lost in time now), had as factors with biggest influence on:<br>
Q-uantity - supply of new builds;<br>
P-rice - supply of financing i.e. availability of mortgages.<br>
That made sense to me. For P-rice, the sensitivity to financing i.e. £££ available to spend on a home, the top#1 factor, was ~7x times larger than the sensitivity to the next #2 factor (forgot which one was that one).<br>

You'd be surprised. :-) Mostly abt foreign alphabets or rules. Everything written in non-Latin alphabet (e.g. registry of birth cert), maybe transliterated into Latin alphabet slightly differently, if inconsistent transliteration rules. Think I remember that in France the register of birth excerpts always write down the birth name - even if you changed it in the mean time, e.g. women that take different or additional surname by marriage. Think some languages write down consonants, but not always the vowels - so variation crops up that way. And so on - this is from the top of my head.<br>
Thinking abt the idea of "if you can't do X, you can't vote". So that would be franchise reduction. Weren't in the US south such rules were used to suppress the black vote? I've seen online pubs that don't allow one to comment, unless one passed a trivial test ("what river flows under Thames bridge"), or a test testing if one's read the article. So this wd "we don't want to end in Idiocracy" argument. Yeah, stupid can do a lot of damage. But clever people have done immense damage over the centuries too. Consider all the ideologies, religions etc - typically not invented by stupid, but clever people.<br>

If there ever was a Chesterton fence argument against changing things willy-nilly - it applies to the voting system.

The idea that anyone knows "the growth limits" doesn't sit well with me. Those claiming "the end is near, listen to me" are just attention seekers. They're modern-day Savonarolas, sociopathic narcissists indulging their worst instincts. The Malthusian Ehrlich-Thanos environmental movement is not for me. They're not only innumerate but also avoid logical thinking and real solutions to improve the human condition. God help us if they prevail—they'll bury us for real. Growing up in a socialist country, I saw the communist party always focused on distant ideals to avoid real work. Lower your gaze, connect with fellow humans more—that sits better with me.<br>

They fundamentally change the dynamic between the public and the state. E.g. when stopped by police, if no-ID cards, it's police's job and competency to establish my identity (and I can help them; or not); while with-ID cards, I have to prove my identity to the policeman to their satisfaction - and that threshold maybe arbitrarily *high*.<br>
The dynamic changes from - trusted by default, to - not trusted by default. Trusted by default is better b/c it better corresponds to our reality where most of the public are honest and not crooks nor criminals. It's a bad idea to treat 100% of the public as untrustworthy, even if 1% maybe so. Much better to deal with he consequences of trusting the untrustworthy 1%.<br>
Immigration - do countries with various forms of obligatory-ID whether digital or cards handle immigration any better? Is UK immigration control now hard b/c we don't know the identity of the people coming in? Afaik on this it's no and no.<br>
Voter ID - did the recent introduction reduce voter fraud? Did UK have a problem with voter fraud to start with? Was the cost - incl voters falsely turned back denied vote - worth it? Again - have not seen any evidence for. Rees-Mogg speech (on video) indicated CONs introduced voter-ID for vote suppression (and it suppressed the wrong votes for them).<br>
I'd look to see if the perspective beneficiaries of ID cards ask for them. The police federation? They usually clamor for all sorts of powers - c.f. breaking of end-to-end encryption - but have not noticed enthusiasm for ID-cards. Maybe the banks? Utilities? Councils? Never heard any of them complaining of problems identifying their customers and asking for ID-cards.<br>
I lived in the 1st 30yrs of my life in my country of birth with obligatory ID cards and still have one myself. Fwiw - self-selection bias and all - on balance I prefer the UK no-single-ID no-compulsory-ID system. Even if this were a startup country and we were starting from scratch Re: ID-or-not.<br>
Given we already have evolved ID systems up and running, it seems to me another one on top will add little, impose all sorts of costs long term, and short term rolling out a nation wide system will be painful with all manner of fails in the process. Given several crisis awaiting action from the new gov uk - don't see how this can be anyone's priority.<br>

It wasn't. The core argument is that gov spending is limited by inflation, that too much gov spending (and private credit for that matter) will drive up inflation. And that inflation is the constraint. Not imaginary numbers dreamed up by OBR. Even I know this and I'm not an mmter and not an american. Just... - google it dude???<br>

It's not that the side anti- should justify "why not" - it's the side that's pro- that has to convince "why". They impose costs - in time, money, effort, liberty. Are these costs worth the gains, once we add all arguments and evidence on both sides of the scales?<br>
They fundamentally change the dynamic between the public and the state. E.g. when stopped by police - if no-ID cards, than it's police's job and competency to discover my identity (and I can help them; or not); while with-ID cards, I have to prove my identity to them to their satisfaction (and that threshold maybe arbitrarily *high*).<br>
The dynamic changes from - trusted by default, to not trusted by default. Trusted by default is better b/c it better corresponds to the reality where most of the public are honest and not crooks or criminals. It's a bad idea to treat 100% of the public as untrustworthy, even if 1% maybe so. Much better to deal with he consequences of trusting the untrustworthy 1%.<br>
Immigration - do countries with various forms of obligatory-ID whether digital or cards handle immigration any better? Is UK immigration control now hard b/c we don't know the identity of the people coming in? Afaik on this it's no and no.<br>
Voter ID - did the recent introduction reduce voter fraud? Did UK have a problem with voter fraud to start with? Was the cost - incl voters falsely turned back - worth it? Again - have not seen any evidence for. Rees-Mogg speech (on video) indicated they introduced voter-ID for vote suppression (and it suppressed the wrong votes for them).<br>
I'd look to see if the perspective beneficiaries of ID cards ask for them. The police federation? They usually clamor for all sorts of powers - c.f. breaking of end-to-end encryption - but have not noticed enthusiasm for ID-cards. Maybe the banks? Utilities? Councils? Never heard any of them complaining of problems identifying their customers and asking for ID-cards.<br>
I lived in the 1st 30yrs of my life in my country of birth with obligatory ID cards and still have one myself. Fwiw - self-selection bias and all - on balance I prefer the UK no-ID system even if this was a startup country and we were starting from 0.<br>
Given we already have evolved ID systems up and running, it seems to me another one on top will add little, impose all sorts of costs long term, and short term rolling out a nation wide system will be painful with all manner of fails in the process. Given several crisis awaiting action from the new gov uk - don't see how this can be anyone's priority.<br>

All liabilities end up transferred onto the LH anyways almost always, and afaik there is no limit to the size of the liability.<br>

The state of 21st cent does much more than the state in 16th century. If the kings of 16th cent raised their game, provided food, shelter, medicine and education and harnessed the reaches of "The Ultimate Resource" (c.f. book), maybe we'd be living in a different world. As it is - they didn't. At most only ~10% of the population had their talents developed and harnessed, and the world stagnated for 1000s of years. Once the other 90% could organize, behead the stupid king (who didn't make much use of his brains anyways?) - boom!! The world changed -<br>

In their world it makes sense. It's not a worldview without logic - it's with obverse logic, upside-down left-is-right logic. That's how one ends holidaying in DDR even after all learn about Stalin's incomparable crimes, defends relativises Pol Pot mass murder and so on. Plus EEuropens are unliked b/c they didn't like communism and are also not on the official righteous victimhood list. You will not change anyone's mind. It's like when talking to a person suffering from schizophrenia - they have reasons for their acts in the world in their heads. Usually people on the receiving end disappear like the poor guy in this cartoon, so no-person no-problem. This time the victims on the receiving end, the Ukrainians, refused to lie down an die - and to the surprise of many - stayed alive, so these issues surfaced. (credit @freeonis_)<br>

I'd look to see if the users of ID cards demand them. The police federation? The banks? Utilities? Councils?<br>
The state needs to become smarter. Not left- or right- - just smarter in doing things. The way business raised its game with the neo-liberal revolution. Afaics where things are IT automated, and low paid low knowledge individual workers are taken out of the loop - the state does achieve that, it does work well. Maybe there is a need for digital ID of some sort, I'm not saying "never" - but I think it's unlikely to have much with immigration control. B/c we know of plenty of ID-cards places have problems with immigration. For an asylum seeker it makes zero difference, ID or not.<br>

Try living alone in the middle of nowhere, or the less extreme - try living together with a band of like minded people. And you will get a better handle on, how much of you present Self is YourSelf alone, and how much is all that Society added to your Self as it is now. Atm you have no way of distinguishing: you were born in this society, you will spend all your life embedded in it, you will die in it. Your idea of your worth self v.s. the rest maybe unrealistic. It is as impossible to separate YourSelf from the rest of the Society, as it is impossible for a fish to separate ItSelf from the Water in which it spends its entire existence. An even weaker experiment is to emigrate, change your place of living with different geography, language, where you will start alone and you will know no one and no one will know you.<br>

ID cards look like part of a solution - but pls examine all evidence with critical eye, don't just assume. They impose costs - in time, money, effort, liberty. Are these costs worth the gains, once we add all arguments and evidence on both sides of the scales? Do countries with various forms of obligatory-ID whether digital or cards handle immigration any better? Is UK immigration control now hard b/c we don't know the identity of the people coming in?  Did voter-ID introduction in the UK reduce voting fraud? Was the cost - incl voters falsely turned back - worth it?<br>
My prejudice is that - no, it's not worth it. Based on: 1) I lived for the 1st 30 years of my life in a country with obligatory ID card (in extremis: failing to produce one on demand 12am-5am would land me in a police station until someone else could come in and confirm my identity to the satisfaction of the policeman manning the desk) 2) have spent some thoughts about pros- and cons- of them.<br>

Accountability to Voters<br>

Moderate: MMP (dual accountability)<br>
Low: PR, STV (weaker individual accountability due to party lists and multi-member constituencies)<br>
Proportionality in Representation<br>
High: PR, STV, MMP<br>

Low: STV, AV (complex counting processes)<br>
And I'm sure you know but writing it for the benefit of any reader: political systems evolve, grow over time, to suit the political actors and balance their powers. Oft result of wars conflicts and blood spilled. If there ever was a Chesterton fence argument for anything - it's for the voting system. Be humble, assume to know little, don't change willy-nilly, and esp not b/c you think "I know better". I'm confident there is no politician at present willing to expand capital on this futile idea further. Hopefully the memory of 2011 is still with them and LDM laid to waste dissuade any takers. There is plenty of more important, more urgent work to be done, with multiple crisis abound. Any academics are welcome to do field work and uncover evidence from countries with different systems than UK, see what their users - voters (and also politicians etc; but esp *not* what the UK researcher) think of them, poss along the lines of https://x.com/mattpovey/status/1809216786740707594 .<br>

The freeholder FH always has the upper hand, holds the whip hand if you like. FH writes invoices, leaseholder LH pays them. If not - the property is repossessed, the LH is kicked out homeless, and saddled with liable for a mortgage, but without the asset the mortgage paid for. There is on paper some legal recourse - tribunals, like special court. But in practice not really. It is slow, uncertain, take tons of time and energy from the LH to pursue. Even if LH wins favorable decision, then LH can't get enforcement, and even if it gets it, then any £££ hit to FH, FH will simply charge it to LH send an invoice to LH for that! Has to be seen to be believed. Being a naturalized citizen, when I read through the lease document at 1st I though I misunderstood: my flat I was buying, reverts, becomes property of the FH again, after 100 yrs! It is so b/c I don't actually own that flat - I just buy the right to reside in the flat for the next 100 yrs. Subject to many conditions. Right that can be taken away if I fail to pay a random invoice of > £250. There are FH that are semi-criminal organizations, and they cotton on many schemes of squeezing the LH and keep doing it - there is no respite no end. It's like paying extra tax, but this time to a crafty almost-criminal. Search FB support groups (or DM me), you will find plenty. A scam I personally got hit: buying a flat, FH never responds to any solicitor communication, legal transfers notifications etc go not done (b/c FH never responds to anything), buyer is unaware, within 12 month will be hit by £3K split between FH fees and penalties for this and that, debt collection agency etc.  Ofc LH will *not* be notified of anything beforehand - LH will find out when debt collector contacts the mortgage lender, and the lender contacts LH. The best case if FH is lost in the mist of time unknown (happens sometimes) - then it can be like "owning a normal flat": LH maintains the property, pays etc for what is needed as it's needed. Does not pay the extra "FH tax" on the top of that. I suspect 1/2 to 2/3 of my yearly bill is "FH tax" - looking at what I'm charged for, versus what is actually done.<br>

I don't know if that had any impact on low turnout, but we should want to find out.<br>
There should be a thorough investigation into its working at this election. That might reassure critics like me - or show the need for change.<br>

Thanks! I liked "Your Money Matters" https://moneysavingexpert.com/family/financial-education/<br>
 too. They are all very good, but I'd say - there's too much there. They don't hold even my attention for long enough - and I'm not even a teenager! 😆 The topic is inherently boring. Better admit and address, than pretend ignore. I'd say the solution is - we need a hero that can take from them all and condense the "greatest hits", the "top 10", short and punchy, and in a form of a visual book of the sorts of Harari's "Unstoppable Us" and Caplan's "Build, Baby, Build" and "Open Borders". That may have some chance to succeed where most usually fail.<br>

FPTP has stood the test of time. If there ever was a Chesterton fence argument for "don't mess with stuff that evolved over time works reasonabley well b/c you don't know much and will likely make it worse or even ruin it". The current crop of Tory bolshie Vandals wd of course now want a swing at the electoral system that booted them out - of course they wd! How about a - NO!! It's not the FPTP it's the Tories that were bad, and good riddance to bad rubbish. The system worked in the end.<br>

It's not that unexpected and peculiar imo. Liberal centrists have not much to fear from the right, they are complementary, they are not competing as much. However - with the left they are more of competitors than cohabitors. My fault with Corbyn-istas is they almost behave as if Communism (and Socialism, as it was in the Eastern block and elsewhere) did not collapse completely, was not completely discredited by the vast crimes committed in its name, by failing in every geography, every continent, every time it was tried. They need to update their world view for the 21-st century and leave the sorry 20-th century behind. Too bad Graeber left so early - he seemed the kind of thinker capable of synthesis of new ideas and modernization of old ones.<br>

Yes excellent. It's not that no one has picked it up. People do pick pick it up, but - so what? What do these people do about it? As he correctly says - this stuff works with the voters, these two game plays are successful, and complementing each other fill the political space. People objecting (e.g. myself included) have not come with a 3rd story that is competitive and compelling enough to out compete these 2 existing stories (he identifies and elucidates well), and carve up some of that political space for itself. Atm these 2 incumbents dominate completely, there is no void left, b/c they fit and complement each other well.<br>

Fair. To be slightly procedural: you disagree with "FPTP creates more accountability", but then you make an argument on representation "... by distorting representation". But the 2nd (representation) is not the same as the 1st (accountability). These are different dimensions we care about, different axis that we make compromises on. What quantity is gained in one quality, is lost in the other quality. I thought the ChatGPT summary was ok, spelling out the trade offs.<br>

"UK is comfortable" as in: we were given a Referendum on the issue in 2011, and we voted 2:1 to keep the existing FPTP in preference to changing to AV. That's not rubbish. And I would not call your opinions rubbish either. What you say is reasonable, but it's just made up stories: that majority want this or that, higher turnout, more "representative" (whatever it means for you) etc. This is something you hope for - but you have no evidence if it's going to turn out that way. If you have strong opinions, you owe it to yourself to read up on the topic . All voting systems have pros and cons. Here is a ChatGPT summary of the trade offs for you:<br>

FPTP has accountability going for it - there is a direct line voter-to-MP, we all know our representative by name. All other systems dilute that to some extent.<br>

Yes, we all find that objectionable, but: it does help creating stable governments. So it's a feature in addition to being a bug. :-) It's a clean break - one team is off the pitch, and a whole new team is out to play. All voting systems have pros-and cons- and make trade offs on the axis like accountability, representation, proportion, complexity, etc. I found excellent this contribution of a UK person living in NL and getting to know their system (and changing his opinion on the comparative pros-and-cons UK and NL it seems) https://x.com/mattpovey/status/1809216786740707594 . My voting experience actually matched what he described - I did it without thinking explicitly about it.<br>
FPTP has accountability going for it - there is a direct line voter-to-MP, we know our representative by name. Zero dilution of responsibility is I think a very good feature in this day and age. Other systems don't have that or don't have it to that extent.<br>

Ok - what you highlight is a valid complaint, but it's lack of representation (on part of the losing side, at least), not lack of accountability. All voting systems have trade offs, on various features we care about (proportionality/representation, accountability, etc). If you feel strongly about this - I hope you research the topic and find out more about the pros- and cons- of various systems. There is no perfect system on all axis of difference (if there was - all countries in the world would have switched to it), there are always trade offs.<br>

Now then - if in a PR system "I the resident have a choice of 10 MPs to go to", and they are accountable to me, then in the current FPTP system where a I have choice of 1, can't be "That just isn't so" for accountability then, can it? That 1 is at least as accountable, and maybe up 10 times more accountable to me, than the 10 MPs in a PR system. If we are talking about accountability. FPTP is not proportional and therefore maybe unfair to some degree on that criteria - but on the accountability axis no system scores higher than it.<br>

The MP may blame whatever reasons (whip etc) and excuses - but you the voter 1) have one MP that you know by name 2) you know how that MP voted, 3) in every Parliament vote. That's what I mean by accountability. In other voting systems we may not even get our own one single MP.<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
I think FPTP coped well, with many more seats becoming marginal than before? FPTP has the *accountability* going for it: I know exactly the name of my MP. There is a direct line between myself and my representative (hello @TweetingCollins - and congratulations! 👏☺️ ), there exists a completely undiluted feedback. Also - FPTP forced me to consider my choice more carefully: in addition to thinking about my desired ideal candidate, I had to consider the probability of its winning versus me wasting my vote. The electoral system is country-wide huge, evolved with its users - voters, but also other actors - parties, state, king - organically. If there ever was a case to be conservative with any change and prefer no-change to change - the electoral system is it.<br>

True that - huge system like a country wide electoral system evolves together with it's users (voters but also other actors -  political parties, civil service, king), match each other like a hand and a glove, likely better adjusted to each other than any other system might be in the short term, probably even medium term.<br>

It's even better than that, you are underselling this if I may say. :-) That @geoffreyhinton 's very lucid observation was: while AI can explain a joke (why it's funny), it's very bad when it comes to writing a joke. B/c working out a good punch line requires planning in advance. AI starts writing what sounds like a joke, goes on for a few sentences, but then it comes up with the lamest of punchlines, b/c it has not pre-planned the punchline. It has to invent one in the last sentence, and there aren't good options at that point, it's too late.<br>

So maybe an argument for >1 MP: I can approach the one most sympathetic, and or most capable, to whatever ails me and I seek help with. But that also dilutes responsibility - they can fob me off to the next guy, and also come judgement day like today. If the system was more open, more transparent, or even if dare I say we had radical transparency in http://gov.uk,  the Civil Service and in Westminster - than maybe I'd change my mind. As things are - the only feedback our rulers/representatives get between their actions and the consequences of their actions for them is day like today once in 5 years.<br>

Good argument! Have not thought of that, even if it matches my experience! 😮 Living in a (formerly) safe CON seat, had to consider not only my "ideal party" - that I was not even sure of - but also the possibility that my vote maybe wasted. That concentrated the mind! So I thought - well, better moderate my expectation, choose a 2nd-3rd-... best myself that has a chance of getting in.<br>

Possibly a better compromise. I thought a variant of that was proposed in the Referendum we had for changing the electoral system - and wasn't voted in.<br>

FPTP is a huge positive in ACCOUNTABILITY: every voter knows the name of their MP. There is a direct line voter-to-representative, allowing for direct feedback. There is no perfect system - only trade offs. The proportional system is bad on the accountability axis.<br>

Do our Conservative colleagues now see why Proportional Representation is a fairer system? Now they’re at the sharp end of it?<br>
Let’s put aside party politics and admit that “winner takes all” has huge flaws — a more representative and collaborative democracy may be what we need.<br>

... and how does that compare to X? I'm finding the X SNR good most of the times (esp with Lists etc), but often it feels like shouting in the void. As there is never much traction interaction for my level of boring that is about 100. Boring level 100 ==  for every 100 views on average I see 1 Like, which is the only feedback I have that anyone read it. Hm - maybe I should try Reddit, maybe there more like minded souls there?<br>

Free marketeers miss that: 1) All societal groups have positive feedback loops. 2) A perfectly free market with zero friction ends in monopoly; realistically, we get oligopolies forming informal cartels shortly before. 3) Free-for-all politics leads to plutocracy or neo-feudalism, with plutes money turning 1-person-1-vote into 1-$-1-vote. 4) Price signals use negative feedback to balance supply/demand and that's why markets work. 5) And that's why when we try to create markets where there are none, without creating a -ve feedback, we end with cargo-cult zombie non-markets.

Yeah - I came from Matlab and R to python, could scarcely believe my eyes what I found. In my job correctness is crucial, any errors are direct $$$ loss. Pandas not being blindingly obvious if changing a matrix changes the existing one, or the changed result goes into a new matrix - that's a big deal. In addition with matrices 20-40GB a piece, operationally I need it to be very explicit what's to happen when a function is applied. (there are no operators doing operations - it's only ever a library, not part of the language)<br>

Oft where there is a longer thread back-and-forth of half dozen people multiple exchanges, I find it easy to lose track of all the replies in the multitude of reply-to-reply-to-... I rely on notifications to keep track, but some turn off notifications, others filter them out etc. I wonder if there is a way for 1) the sender of a reply to see, if 2) the accounts mentioned in the reply specifically, have 3) received 4) seen the reply post? Like there is say in WhatsApp group discussion where one can see if 1) all participants in the chat have seen the message 2) can click on the message and then see what accounts 3) it was delivered to (but not et seen) 4) delivered and seen too.<br>

... too right! And during Covid the CON gov - as odious as it is - actually mostly solved the problem too! Then 1 year latter decided to "unsolve it" and threw the people on the streets again. It's always a political choice! It's not inevitable - the homelessness, the scale of it. It's been solved in the past, can be solved in the future again.

Сигурно - ама има ли една направија на светов што е само и исклучително позитивна, без некоја мана? Мислам нема. Него ме насмеа со "расипан вид" 😂 : кога бевме деца родителите вриштеа по нас "не седи блиску до телевизорот, ќе ги расипеш очите". После XX години возрасен некаде налетав на преглед на студии на тема "дали далечината растојанието е фактор во расипување на видот", и доказите беа во прилог на НЕ. Друг пример - на море и езеро родителите вриштеа хистеришеа "излегувај од вода ќе се разболиш" и тоа беше нон-стоп војна деца-родители. 😂 Децении подоцна јас не им викав на моите деца да излезат нешто посебно - рачунам ќе излезат сами кога ќе им достуди. Не приметив дека нешто се разболуваа повеќе отколку што сум се разболувал јас како дете. Има многу примери за замислени стравови. Сите ние имаме бујна фантазија, сме прилагодени лесно да се плашиме (тоа опстанува; тие што не се плашеле ги изеле мечки 😆). Мислам има и термин - catastrophising.<br>

True, but TBF most critiques I read online are in the "not even wrong" category as in not even critiquing MMT b/c they have not say read @StephanieKelton 's book or even @wbmosler shorter writeup. Cult like - for sure, but one needs a sect-like disciples to prevail over an existing sect that's a competitor. Conventional econ orthodoxy is so poor when it comes to the currency as to be indefensible. Econs do much better on the actual economy, actual stuff produced and services rendered. Given economy is total sum of all transactions each one consisting of seller-and-buyer-and exchanging stuff-for-currency - being wrong about the trivial part of the exchange (the currency; the easiest of things) is frustrating. The currency part is not even econ - a fiat currency is probably an area of Law 1st and foremost, and 2nd probably more IT then Econ. :-) Anyways - complaining about the tone or the messenger (the yellow bit below) and ignoring the message is just - meh, not worth spending keystrokes on. Practitioners in the finance industry and traders I find to have much better grasp on the currency part of the exchange. They get feedback from the actual world around them, have financial markets to test a theory, so the ones that survive are not killed are the ones that are right.<br>

Never heard of these - todo lookup up. I'm keen on information theory and multi-dimensional space. Everything we do in information theory, now machine learning and AI, happens in many-to-millions dimensional spaces. In contrast, our intuitions are tuned to very low dimensional spaces, chiefly our 3-dimensional physical world. Just by observing the ratio of hyper- cube and ball, as N in N-dim increases, we get intuition of how our low-dim intuition may mislead us when thinking about high N-dimensional spaces (N>1e6): 1) the space moves into the corners and away from the middle as N increases 2) so measures of centrality (means etc) maybe less informative in high-N: they are not that representative given the low probability mass there 3) every observation becomes an outlier in some dimension when N is sufficiently high 4) does that imply we will observe the space as discrete rather than continuous? with every observation jumping from one corner to other corner of the space.<br>

MMT as a phrase is such a self inflicted fail that I think only academic could have possibly failed this bad. Fails 1) Modern - it's not modern, it's been on for as long as we've been off a gold standard - significant time period now 2) Theory - it's not a theory, it's a practice practised daily by every gov treasury every central bank every parliament voting a yearly budget in the world 3) The acronym matches Magic Money Tree that is one of the low hanging attacks against it (but no less effective, esp with the smooth brains that's the vast majority of us civilians) - very unfortunate. But mmt gets so much unneeded resistance (from academia) and unreasonable straw man attacks that I 'm reluctant to add to its detractors. As for acronym change - it's too late now, for better or worse we are stuck with MMT.<br>

Maybe the young are the latest losers of the current neo-liberal consensus? Can't get a good job, can't get their own place to live in. Reminds me of the stagnation in the socialist block in the 90s - young people's top problems were #1 job, #2 flat to live in.<br>

Makes sense. Assume that existing/prior 50yrs system has winners and losers. The losers are 25% and want change. The winning 25% want the system to not change. The rest 50% are undecided/meh/don't care. The winners will conclude that for things to stay the same thinks will need to change. Macron was one of those agents - change in order to stay the same. There will be more if we are lucky, so for the system to adapt gradually.<br>

Ages ago remember seeing study on the UK house prices sensitivity to various factors. Afaicr top-1 sensitivity was to the factor "finance availability" (mortgages etc), and the coefficient of regression was x5-x6 times higher than the coeff on the 2nd factor that was supply-demand imbalance. BoE/regulation allowing for mortgages market expansion to new customers, allowing slacker availability criteria like multiples-to-salary to lend ever more etc - I'm guessing that would be #1 factor influencing the house prices increases.<br>

Where can a civilian non-expert look for innovations in law making? Even with plain old IT: say makinging the law making process into kind of a Wiki, with history of changes, all public and transparent by default, so we know every change made, and when/why/by whom. Also - maybe have sunset provisions, also when adding new laws on the statute some kind of rule "find an existing law to delete - if you want new one in" (for the laws without a sunset clause?) thus acknowledging explicitly that any capacity for enforcement is at all times finite.<br>

:-) IDK why you'd think "I have not noticed". On the contrary - I have noticed, and so have many others. Ideas and noticing is easy - changing things is hard. Even for the ambitions and energetic! Yeah - sunset provisions are good, also when adding new laws on the statute some kind of rule "find an existing law to delete - if you want new one in" (for the laws without a sunset clause?) thus acknowledging explicitly that any capacity for enforcement is at all times finite - maybe a good thing. Changing the law making process into some kind of a Wiki, with history of changes too, all public and transparent by default, so we know every change was made when/why/by whom/ - also a good thing.

In their minds the leaders you mention had reconciled the contradicting strands of ideas (of the kind the questioneer put forward), they have made it clear to themselves first and foremost, and in the process worked out the reasons, and the gives and takes. Their speaking was clear because their thinking was clear. Even when disagreable - it was clear what one disagreed with.<br>

That too - but a lot of these things are outside the market. The value is in the "free" - free elections, free market. Freedom allows all individuals to decide as independently as possible so their errors are independently distributed so they average out. Works b/c the outcomes are in the future, and we are all similarly ignorant of the future, our errors are about the future do not differ by orders of magnitude. Whereas say piloting a plane or a surgery - we don't allow for freedom there. 😁<br>

They are randomly evolved protocols + media for transferring information. The underlying producer on the sending side and consumer on the receiving side are the same human brain. Humans brains produce and consume information at about the same rates. So the amount of information contained in the messages that is the language must be about the same too. Even if the mechanical articulators move at different speeds in various languages.<br>

Information theory is the logic of science. Logic allows for only true/false, 0/1. Information theory extends that makes it a continuum in an interval [0,1]. The hard logic of true/false becomes a soft "degree of truthfulness".<br>

TBF you chose a bad example. European parliament is not a parliament the same way national parliaments are. Aptly - it's a talking shop, there is voting, but the real-real vote happens at the Council of Ministers (where each member state has a veto). As EU is a Union of *States*, its constituents are States that are in the union, and not the citizens of these states. Further, in the EU national parliaments, there is a large degree of proportionality and less so of majorality, and the public stance shifts slowly. UK is a better example. It has completely majortarian system (FPTP - First Past The Post) where 51% of the vote that wins gets 100% of the power (so zero proportionality). And in the UK we see relatively small-ish majorities prevailing one side or the other have large outcome (brexit vote, get brexit done govs since, expected CON annihilation this coming Thursday).<br>

Yep - true that! A proper hard jail time. Not to rehabilitate the one in (we don't care about him/her), but to deter the others. Damaging the public purse for 10s of Millions, with a soft bribe that's the price of an expensive dinner (<10K) is way too frequent.<br>

Amazing to witness, on par with "When Prophecy Fails". Actually awesome to witness a not-quite-gullible guy proclaiming "politicians X Y lie all the time" (oh-key maybe true maybe false IDK) and then jumping to "... therefore politician Z never lies is truthful 101%"! Amazing!!<br>

GDP drop is not quite "killing the patient". It's replacing one problem (inflation) with another problem (unemployment, GDP drop). No need to pretend otherwise. Inflation was clearly a problem for a majority large enough to vote into office a candidate that had all established parties/machines agitating against him.<br>

Wars are the plague of humanity. Also about the most likely thing to destroy humanity from within. After WW1 (and WW2 - 2nd attempt ongoing) the solution some of the humanity hit on was to parcel the Earth into disjoint territories - countries. Further - largest countries voluntarily agreed to not start aggressive wars against smaller countries, not to try take over their territory and extinguish the smaller state. "To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime;  it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war  crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the  whole" stood the test of time. It's as good in 2025 as it was in 1945. This looks like a win for the small countries, but is also really beneficial to the bigger stronger countries - as there the temptation for aggressive war is the strongest. Various aggressive wars (US in Vietnam, Iraq, now Russia in Ukraine) are dumb b/c they bring risks to the big country that it doesn't otherwise have to worry about. It's a self-inflicted risk. WW1 extinguished the Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman and Russian empires! No one would have predicted that in 1914. WW2 ended with Germany in two pieces. In the current age of technology, with the barrier to going nuclear ever lower and countries are ever richer - small countries acquiring nuclear deterrent may reduce the risk of smaller wars. At the cost of increasing the probability of a rarer event (a nuclear war) with more devastating consequences. The voluntary organization that is the UN rule of "aggressive war is wrong" is not ideal, but gets rid of 95% of the strife. Like parents with kids of similar age forever squabbling: a way of conflict resolution is to say "the one of you not in his/her room is in the wrong - no discussion of whys/hows/who started first/what".<br>

Your nations are not falling apart. (it's possible that one's private life falling apart clouds one's judgement) Yes there are plenty wrongs to be righted - but so is always the case. Your societies have never been richer better off, healthier etc. You know but nothing of the system you claim to idolise. If you knew more - you would know that Putin/system lies way way more than the UK system. In fact - Putin and the Russian system deny that any such thing as truth exists. Their system is nihilistic when it comes to the truth, to the idea that some things are true and others are false. Invasions of Iraq and Ukraine are interesting indicator. US didn't deny they are going to invade - they were trying to manufacture evidence for reasons to invade. Russia until 24-Feb denied flatly that any invasion is in the works, then the next day forgot everything about "we are not invading" and turned to the next propaganda item. And that is the MO since the Soviet times: truth does matter one iota. Look up Surkov "political technologist" - the parties, the elections, both the position and the opposition, all is fabrication a theater production a cosplay. He thinks truth does not matter can be manufactured at will.<br>

Galloway is to the Labour party what Farage is to the Conservative party. Interesting contrast: while knowledgeable on Israel-Palestine having being involved for 50 years, on Ukraine-Russia he's clueless and it shows. The reasoning is incoherent, can't hold the argument and so resorts to slogans. Seems he feels it at some level? - avoiding eye contact when talking plain stupid, something Morgan noticed (to his credit).<br>

Depends on the quality of the prediction. Imagine there was a parrot standing on your shoulder, and as you are trying to say something, the parrot says it, then again for the next word, the next one etc. 😁 The parrot guesses all the words you meant to say, completely accurately! Wouldn't you conclude that this is one smart parrot, that got into your head somehow, and knows you as well as you know yourself? If on the other hand the parrot never guesses a word, is alway wrong, and spouts gibberish - that's another matter completely. So the quality or lack of makes all the difference. Models atm don't have any grounding to the truths and falsehoods of our world, b/c all they get is some text. Once they are hooked to sensors and can observe for themselves - things may change.<br>

One to add to your arguments: there is the phenomenon of Food Banks in the UK that appeared since 2010 (never heard about them before). Stuff (food!) is available, but people lack the money. Ergo - Food Banks to the rescue, to get Stuff (that we already have! just sitting there!!) to the people that lack Money.<br>
More general argument: when looking at the economy as the sum of all the transactions that happen that are always - always! - Stuff-for-Money exchange (illustrated nicely in @RayDali<br>
's excellent "How the Economic Machine Works"), for a transaction to happen there needs to exist both Stuff and Money, so the exchange is completed between Buyer and a Seller. If any of the 4 parts is missing - Stuff, Money, Buyer, Seller - then transactions can not happen. No transactions - no GDP. :-)<br>

Hate to be a party poop - but it's the outgoing Conservative majority that brought in the NetZero legislation (Theresa May, 2019). So by your argument, voting them out in a weeks time (we hope) is a vote against NetZero. In reality - voting one or the other in/out has almost zero to do with NetZero and everything to do with other things, chiefly - the standard of living that has not gotten better and in many was gotten worse. TBH poor reasoning more befitting an agit-prop party apparatchik not a thinking person (let alone scientist striving for truth). muting the thread now<br>

Polls don't outweight elections, that's why countries are ruled by the winners of elections and not polls. Not talking about a single election - but many in many countries over non-trivial period of time. People want to live better lives, not worse - that's pretty clear. Back to polls - for a bit of cheer for respite from this depressing thread<br>

The UK boss class has had socialism for them for too long. We need them to raise their game. Being granted a monopoly is a not only a license to print money, but also a privilege, and should be treated as such. Some of those seats could have been filled if tickets were offered at 99p. Next time franchise is awarded, have penalties in the contract such that @AvantiWestCost<br>
 executives would be relieved of their duties and be allowed to spend more time tending their gardens. Ideally their posts would be filled with disciples of Michael O'Leary. Do not penalize them in £££ - that's futile, they will just pass that as a cost to their customers (=us, the paying public). Make them leave jobs they are doing badly.<br>

I remember seeing FB have  "Snooze this account for 30days in your News feed" or similar. Sometimes I want to read from an account but I've had enough of their posts today, and X for whatever reason keeps pushing their posts and spamming me. Then if I can use current "Mute", but it being forever, has the perverse consequence of me forgetting to unmute them latter. How about giving your users a time limit mute please?<br>

I agree they may help - but it's possible that other things help with that too. Not being religious myself wouldn't know for sure. Another maybe religion +ve (saw it come up today): if I believe in an all powerful all seeing God - then I maybe less inclined to assign such god-like powers to a human. Brings some humility to maybe help deflate ours' typically ginormous egos.<br>

Wish they were well informed - but they are not, unfortunately. TBF theirs is not the "far away country with people of whom we know nothing" type of lack of knowledge. No - theirs is the "does worse than random chance" wrong knowledge:  what they know is wrong, it just ain't so.<br>

 Latest book is quite a reveal of the internal workings of the political system. Before I was surprised by how wrong they were all the time and most of us could see it but apparently not them. Now I'm surprised that things are not way way worse.<br>

The all knowing, completely good and benevolent entity you imagine, a religious person may recognise as God. We humans are less than that, we can't do what you mention we might. The 4 approaches will diverge in practice fairly quickly. Every day when running experiments we decide "do I run with this or that", for the 4 sites to mirror each other those decisions would have to about match - very unlikely. Advances published will ofc propagate if replicated - but that's a good thing. Ideas will also transfer with people moving, rumours and innuendos of "breakthroughs". That again will be checked and if replicated adopted, and is on balance good. So some amount of cooperation among the competition will happen too. Leaving it to people doing these things to decide as is their conscience without much top-down interference is the best we can hope for afaics.<br>

We don't know in advance which team will solve it, or even if a solution to the problem will be found at all. It's simply a way of throwing more people, more effort, into attacking the problem. They compete but also collaborate - so it's not that much different to if they were all part of a single research group. Any sufficiently large group will create subgroups anyways - not unlike the competing teams. Competition + collaboration are the two modes of interaction and both need harnessing in whichever way we can.<br>

Thanks - seen it before. Would've agreed if they were an ordinary outfit. As things are - they are running a shadow government, not just policy think tank. Their AgitProp is beamed down into our living rooms every evening, they incubate ministers and prime ministers etc. With great power comes great responsibility.

If not that justification (NATO), Putin will use a different justification. Russia has agency and decides on its own. So Nato, Eu, Ukraine, language etc - they are all just post-fact justifications. They are not "a cause". No aggressor ever goes "I am taking over the world, haha" (evil cackle, strokes a white cat). They always invent plethora of justifications, oft contradictory. US invented justifications for the Iraq invasion. Germany invented justifications for conquering Europe first Central then West and finally East (inc the Soviet Union). Stalin also had dozens of justifications why he is invading "his parts" of Eastern Europe in 1939. Sheesh IDK this needs explaining to grown up persons. The reason "why" cretins like Putin and Bush do it is - "because they can".<br>

Работа тешка има колку сакаш, може да им најдеме на луѓето ем тешка ем корисна работа. 😊 Не мора само тешка - може и двете, и тешка и корисна. Да имаме некој ќар од маката. Да не биде само cosplay - демек јаки сме, ама као на атлетски митинг, трчаме на 100м се тепаме од напор за забава. Тоа за тренинг за забава се прави 1) малку привремено 2) за учење тренирање 3) кога си млад не знаеш па учиш. А сите цел живот да се мачат за никаква корист - тоа не мора, може и подобро од тоа.<br>

Во војска (1987) истата психологија: “Q: водниче зашто не тормозиш нели до вчера и ти се мачеше со нас не ти беше право? A: мене ме мачеа па истрпев, трпете и вие". Робот кога ќе стане господар, прави исто што господарот претходно правел. Така системот се репродуцира, затоа останува ист: други луѓе ама исто прават. Да направам различно е голема работа - треба фантазија да смислам различно, труд да го спроведам, харизма да ги убедам другите да ми помогнат наместо да ме опструираат, памет и среќа новото различно да успее да не пропадне и да е подобро од старото. А да правам и јас како што правел мојот господар - не треба фантазија, бара помалку труд, средината веќе е навикната го прифаќа, и знам дека иако не е идеално ама функционира. Затоа робот прави тоа што правел господарот пред него кога бил во иста позиција.<br>

Muscat (alcoholic) feels tad too heavy, too strong on a warm summer evening to me. Whereas the zero version (or maybe 0.5%?) felt somewhat lighter more refreshing, while retaining the muscaty taste & smell. Not a wine person here - I guess I was just surprised it was not horrid.<br>

Sachs anti-USG is at most a 2nd order term correction to a 1st order pro-USG term in the function that approximates the truth. You are not dumb - why settle for the only 1 of the 2 terms (surely better to use both), and why settle on 2 terms only? You can do better than that.<br>

It is a tenet, but I would dispute that it's 1) a central one, and 2) exclusive to capitalism. IMO capitalism should work way better once UBI brings freedom to people currently lacking it b/c they lack $$$ to buy it. Only capitalists will have their power over us reduced.<br>

Assuming "all anti-USG is true" is likely to be almost as wrong as "all pro-USG is true". The world does not exist in only two states. For every A that is true, there is infinity of not-As that are B, C, D ... Z that are false. So if USG says "B", Sachs (also Chomsky etc) deciding algorithm being "ah-haa! so therefore not-A is the truth!" and then jumping to - "therefore C" (or "D", "E" ... etc) - will be wrong too. One is simply unlikely to hit on the true thing "A" if the decision algorithm is solely "not-B". More likely one will hit on C, D, ... Z - all also untrue. So just being a contrarian, multiplying by (-1) everything USG says - is also going to not lead to the truth. In this case, instead from "aggressive war is the supreme international crime, Iraq invasion is a crime" concluding "therefore RU invasion of Ukr is also a crime and should not happen, RU should withdraw, like US did from Iraq", GS concludes "if US does it, so can RU". That seems not only wrong and immoral - but also dumb in that it is a bad policy. Similarly - Monroe doctrine (wrong, bad) being an alibi for "RU should have the right to occupy Eastern Europe". Not only morally but also practically bad, a recipe for many disasters. Every episode GS mentions is a saga on its own. He extracts one sentence in support of whatever his idea-de-jour is. To take apart one - I grew up next door and with "the problem of Kosovo" (mentioned as "bombing of Belgrade") in the news daily since 1980. I am well aware of the genesis, the saga, the conclusion. GS assessment is cartoon level, is tragi-comical. There were 100s of twists and turns and 1000s of actors over ~30 years. US acted the way it did only after exhausting all other avenues (as US sometimes does - tries everything else before doing the right thing). So to frame it as some US grand plan is anti-vax/denier level perception of reality.<br>

Not confined to politics and politicians exclusively. Similar is observed in music bands (contributes to the  "2nd album curse"), also with influencers and cultural entrepreneurs of all sorts. Once they try to 2nd guess and hit  on "what my audience wants" they typically decline. But not abruptly at once - it happens over time, takes time for the in-authenticity and deception to be imbibed by their audiences, almost by osmosis. There is not an one big reveal. A dynamics similar to enshitification of social media platform popularized by @doctorow<br>

The most excellent "Open: The Story Of Human Progress" by @johanknorberg lists several such regressions of knowledge and technology. I tend to lean on the side of - size in peoples and lands matters for increases in knowledge, there is criticality both acquiring and maintaining knowledge. And is probably super-linear as a lot is in the connections too not only in the nodes of the networks. So the reverse holds as well - decreases in groups sizes mean decrease in their knowledge. For knowledge is always a collective phenomenon it seems - there is always nodes and connections, that seem to be basic architecture for building up layers of complexity.<br>

How are we people in groups going to synchronise, how are we going to cooperate? Leaving it to our own free will is noble and fine - but no guarantee it's going to lead to group organisations that function, that get things done. Hierarchical pyramidal strict dictatorships in private corporations and public organisations alike maybe Darwinian survivors among competitors. I don't like this at all - but what other alternative explanations are about? I have seen anarchy in a dying state and headless companies - that doesn't work.<br>

Interesting ideas but wrong species. My desire to save comes from my need to stay alive at all times. Once gov kills me b/c I did not pay tax or I expire b/c lacking food & shelter - there is no coming back for me. The random process is multiplicative not additive - someone elses +ve offsetting my -ve does no resurrect me. Macro level (society) in theory fine but micro level (I) in reality am dead. B/c macro- emerges from micro- and not the other way around (macro is higher than micro in hierarchy) - ultimately macro will fail too. Good read though - thanks!<br>

Ok I stand corrected, I didn't have the small holders of NSandI and savings cash accounts in mind when I wrote "wealthy". I had in mind persons with wealth 5M-20M at their disposal that are getting BI basic income from the IR. They take inflation risk, but then have zero credit risk - so I guess that evens out? I guess we can chalk the delayed consumption on the +ve side of the ledger why savers should be rewarded with non-zero IR?<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
Yep - entirely correct, agreed, that too. IR increase adds further to creditors (that are net positive), and subtracts further from debtors (that are net negative). But my prejudice is that for BoE the small holders of NSandI and small savers matter less given BoE remit(s).<br>

Commercial banks make more £££ with higher IR. BoE works for the banks, it's banks' bank. Further - holders of UK gov bonds (the wealthy) roll over gov debt replacing low->high IR bearing bonds, increasing their fixed income. BoE is "for whoever has, to him more will be given".<br>

Possible, I can imagine that. I can see how a bot farm paying 1000 accounts x $100 = $100K pa + another 10K free tier accounts, interacting between themselves, would have immense reach, thus making the expense be insane good RoI. Because the reach seems proportional to the interactions (like, forward, reply, quote) between the nodes (accounts), and those interactions increase with the *square* of the accounts number. So x2 times acc increase results in x4 times reach increase. Compared to say running a plain old propaganda satellite channel - the $$$ spend is peanuts.<br>

But that's not what I wrote. I am fine with pseudo/anonymous and all manner of accounts, I'm not advocating for any compulsory ID by anyone, not on Twitter, not on the web or the Internet. I'm advocating for 1) on Twitter only 2) accounts that *do want themselves* do have *real person* verified by Twitter, 3) for Twitter to have a process to do that, 4) for accounts that want it themselves; and 5) I as a user of whatever designation - free, premium, premium+, verified - or not - to have tools where I can filter, select etc posts and accounts on that axis of difference, "verified real life human yes/no". I already do this to some extent by necessity via lists etc - just advocating for Twitter to help me a bit. I already e.g. verify my ID to my bank to use their online services. Twitter could offer - non-compulsory, voluntary for accounts that want it - service for that, for Twitter only.<br>

They could, but that would be manual work, manual vetting, so I presume - they don't. If the payment goes through - then all is fine, they just accept the money and the account is now a Premium account. Twitter have introduced a more expensive Premium+ account too!<br>

There is no end to the talents of that man. He was shock-therapist, then something or other with development, Covid, now international geopolitics. To get serially mostly disparate things mostly wrong, and to keep telling the world so publicly, strikes me as odd. His ego must be through the roof. What other reason can there be? Strikes me as IYI (intellectual-yet-idiot) version of the Brexit voters you posted yesterday. Where he does tell a number that can be checked - e.g. "1K-2K killed per/day" so in ~850 days of war Ukr lost between 850K and 1.7M soldiers; while they only had about 200K-300K of army to start with - his claims don't tally with reality. He's like non-tech-bro centrist version of David Sacks. Looking around for evidence to support that one idea he's got in his head. Never bother to collect evidence against it and weight it, never bother to consider competing ideas hypothesis and never collect evidence and counter-evidence for those too. A person incapable of rational thinking imo. What he says maybe true or false - but him saying it does not alter the probabilities in any meaningful way.<br>

Researcher is asked "pick one number that you think is most likely the age", the s/he picks "392". Then s/he is asked "now you are allowed to pick two numbers determining a range [from,to]", and s/he picks "[272,512]". And so on. That's the meaning of number(s) quoted.<br>

The state needs to build assets. The assets built by by the previous generations were sold off (fine), but new assets were not subsequently built (not fine). Income tax, consumption tax etc - these are all like income from labor. The state has very little passive income from assets atm. This is like the difference between owning your home (==asset), and renting and paying rent every month (==significant additional £££ in the outgoings per month).<br>

😂😂 Indeed! 🎯 You are 100% right, they would be. Strauss-ianism of the "you can't handle the truth" few good man -type - similarly to oft maligned Machiavelli-anism - are adaptations of the system to its users. We have other adaptations too - selection of the office holders, education of both the representatives and the voters, informed electorate etc - that make the system work better by band-aiding the obvious fail points.<br>

Alternative indicator: look at the amount of leafleting and/or canvassing the non-Tory alternatives do in your local area. That's a good proxy for the alternatives own expectations, and should be a better indicator.

Add setting "N" and make "Follow acc X yes/no" into "Follow X show 1 out of N posts". So when I set N different from 1, in my "Following" TL I get only 1 out of every N posts of account X. This is so that very prolific posters that I still want to read from - just not everything all the time - don't overwhelm my "Following" TL turning it into an "Acc X" TL. Have the default N=1, but allow us users to change it to N>1 to get more control over our TL.<br>

 ELI5-ed our banking system to me enough to not be bamboozled.<br>
The Landscape of Money (Part 1): State money, bank money & plug-in institutions by Brett Scott We sometimes hear the term 'fiat money', and get told that it's issued by states. States, though, are but one part of the modern fiat money system, which also includes commercial banks who issue their own form of money, and various institutions like Paypal that 'plug-in' to the banking sector. In this video I sketch out a broad overview of the state money system, bank money system, and payments system, whilst touching on controversial topics like 'fractional reserve banking' (credit creation of money), central bank digital currencies (CBDC's), and the 'War on Cash'. This video is Part 1 of a three-part series: the next video will go into the cryptocurrency systems that claim to challenge this fiat money system<br>

Afaics there are usually two camps in every gov: anti-war, and pro-war. So between USA-China, there would be in total 4 groupings - {CN,antiwar} {CN,prowar} {US,antiwar} {US,prowar} - at minimum. And often more. No gov is one perfect single monolithic block.<br>

Like USG declares loudly "we recognise fully independent country of Taiwan" or similar, and China gov is like "well we have no choice now, we have to invade" and go ahead and do it. Wouldn't that be very silly on the part of China? To be baited like a 2 year old? That would be too easy for US. I refuse to believe. No one can force China to do a random stupid thing.<br>

"Some want war" is a straw man (most on the UKR side want to live in peace) and trivial (obv Russia prefers aggressive war to the alternatives - hence the invasion). The argument against "any peace better than any war" is: that was tried 2014-2022 ("let Putin have what he wants") and led to the current state of "largest war on Eu soil since 1945“. There is non trivial risk that doing the same again, leads to further invasions and expansion of war into Moldova, the Baltic states, and Poland by 2030+. I am not saying I have a sure proof solution - anyone saying that is saying to have found a solution that evaded jointly Chamberlain *and* Churchill. Just pointing of the reasonable risks in your position. We can square various considerations and strands of evidence - both distant (1939) and recent (2014) history, the words v.s. deeds of the Ru side, the logic of a continental empire (ideology Ru has fallen back to it seems; c.f. Ru expanding West since 18th cent) etc. For war it's sufficient for one side to want it, but peace needs two sides. If one side sufficed for peace - we'd have achieved world peace centuries ago.<br>

Significant change is inevitable now the system is no longer improving the lives of significant portions of its citizens. The only Q is if it's going to be smart change, that in the future will have good outcomes so retrospectively we will come to see the ideas as smart - we can't see that now at present - or the opposite (bad outcome, we conclude those particular ideas were stupid - but only in retrospect). The moderate centrists have bias for "no change" in the battle of ideas - that is guaranteed to fail to hold the fort, as the forces making lives of significant portion of the population worse keep grinding, the pressure for change keeps increasing. Only good ideas for change in a good direction can overwhelm the bad ideas - "no significant action" centrism can't. A 2nd problem is that it's not trivialy easy to discern good from bad ideas for change in the present - that will become more clear as the future unfolds. That makes centrists doubly reluctant (the 1st reason being for most of them their own lives are not intolerable, not that bad).<br>

A stronger country (US, RU etc) can always overwhelm a smaller country in an aggressive war of choice. A smaller country will always be at risk of that. Nuclear weapons equalize the field for a small country. A big country like US or RU can give up their nuclear weapons without much risk - as a small country can't invade them and overwhelm them in a conventional war. The opposite is not true. Reading now about Israel weapons https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons_and_Israel and see e.g. "Israel crossed the nuclear threshold on the eve of the Six-Day War in May 1967 ... The crude atomic bombs were  readied for deployment on trucks that could race to the Egyptian border  for detonation in the event Arab forces overwhelmed Israeli defenses". This is a scenario I have in mind: where a small state is at risk of being wiped off the map, being completely destroyed.<br>

Mostly reading through Wiki https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons_and_Israel . France was a major enabler, some help from UK - but looks like US was very unhappy.

That's a straw man argument. No one claims they deter all conventional war. They deter catastrophic loss of statehood. If India was about conquer all of Pakistan, or vice versa, I imagine nukes will fly. It's a self-destruct option - I go down but I take out my enemy with me.<br>

Yes Finland would risk US diplomatic spat (US would be unhappy), yes Russia would be unhappy too. Don't understand what "USA will flip out anyways" means.

The US "nuclear umbrella" is a promise that is always less reliable than a country owning their own nuclear deterrent.<br>

Agreed a nuclear Armageddon is an existential risk for humanity, an extinction level event. Given that RUS conventional army is far stronger than any of it's neighbors - RUS need their nukes way less than FIN. So it's on RUS (and US, CN, IN, PK) to give up on their nukes. And small countries like FIN (and POL, the Balts, other CEEu countries menaced by RUS) need to acquire them, so to level the field and make nukes less useful to the big countries. Aside - there is no need for BS rudeness when discussing ideas.<br>

I don't think anyone can know the future - including yourself. As for the past - Finland was an imperial Russia possession for a century and was latter attacked too (as part of a wider 1939 plan DE-SU to carve EEu between themselves). As you say - RU "has to" nuke FI. Doesn't now FI have even more reasons to get nukes? After all - "if you nuke Helsinki we will strike back St Pittersburg and Moscow too" is a deterrent -no? (Aside: I don't agree they "have to" do anything; it's their choice, and them removing agency from themselves is to absolve themselves from the responsibility for doing bad things; all bullies and stronger sides do "I had do this bad thing" to justify aggression that really is unjust, it's aggressive war 101)<br>

The point is that the state of Finland would have a nuclear deterrent - similar to what Russia has - at its disposal to fight against a Russia invasion. Whether Russia invades b/c of US or China or Mars - is not of a great relevance to Finland. The 1st duty of a nation state is it ensure safety of the nation and prevent its destruction.<br>

Finland had Russian Empire/Soviet Union/Russia as neighbor that is 1) bigger and stronger; and 2) antagonistic to its statehood. Israel had the Arab states neighbors that in 1970-s (when it got the A-bomb) were committed to its destruction (hence a number of wars). Further - Finland and Israel are about similar in size of population, fairly small countries. Hence my comparison. North Korea would be another country of comparison: smaller country with hostile neighbors that developed nuclear deterrent. (fwiw I expect my clarification to further inflame your hysteria and anticipate block incoming)<br>

Genuine Q: any reasons for Finland to not develop its own nuclear deterrent, maybe in cooperation with Poland and the Baltics? Finland is not unlike Israel in 1970s - surrounded by bigger stronger neighbor(s) that openly aim for destruction of the smaller neighbor's statehood.<br>

B/c the dynamic but macro-illiterate duo of Cameron+Osborne were selected for their dunder-headed idea that cutting public services is good and growing them is bad. Alas they had full support of the media-macro journalist clowns, so effectively "stripping the roof" in that upside-down wold was "fixing the roof while the sun shines". Too bad UK public can only vote and destroy the Conservative party - wish we could do the same with the media-macro journo-cloowns.<br>

🎯 +1 me too 😊 One gets to see behind the curtain of power that affects our daily lives in many ways. If we were to restrict ourselves only to saintly perfect people - we'd not get far, as those are in short supply. And especially in positions of power. Better to take what one gets, the bad with the good, and separate and discern ourselves. We can all hold two thoughts in our heads simultaneously, it does not to be a single one.<br>

Interesting to learn that. Living without over the air TV since 2001. Online content seemed more appealing to me - but assumed I'm an outlier. Find YouTube usually more interesting  than iPlayer. Some iPlayer content still consumed, mostly for sentimental reasons - e.g. latest re-watch "Old dogs new tricks" - but can't remember what current interesting stuff I've watched on it last.<br>

TBF the only thing we all "have to do" is die. Everything else is optional. Since time immemorial the claim that "we *have to do* xyz" has been used as a license for behaving badly. "It's not that I want to do this bad thing to you - noo, I'm compelled by a higher force, I'm a mere tool". Usually it takes ideology to persuade a non-evil person to do evil. At other times the person is just evil and the "have to" reasoning is a convenient cover for himself and others. Putin doesn't *have to* do anything. He can even declare victory (like Milosevic in Kumanovo) and bring his army home.<br>

Majority of people can hold 1 thought in their heads. Then a minority can hold 2 - huge improvement! You're in the third, tiny sliver of humanity, that can hold a larger number of ideas (potentially infinite) about the world around. True that "probability is the logic of science". It would be good for people to be exposed to simple true/false logic even if via oratory or rhetoric. Even better if via mathematical logic, incl rules of reasoning like podus ponens and modus tollens. Then qualifiers - none, one, at least one, any, all - can be added to move towards probabilistic reasoning.<br>

True that in number of man - but: maybe pple don't give SU enough credit, it's b/c of the fact that for the first 2 years of WW2 (when UK was fighting Nazi Germany), that same Soviet Union was an ally of Nazi Germany. They jointly invaded Poland (the "official start" of WW2), which was just one act in a bigger plan to divide Central and Eastern Europe between themselves - the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact. The SU put it in motion on their end: partition of Poland, taking over the Baltics, Moldova, western Ukraine, Finland Winter war.<br>

Human reason is necessary but not sufficient. Reasoning generates hypothesis - but only empirical experiment can tell us if it worked out or not. Reasoning has to assign degrees of truthfulness to various assumptions - and these are always wrong to some degree. Reason alone does not suffice. Marxisms have been tried at varying geographies, times, peoples, cultures - and have failed every time. Sorry to disappoint. There are other ideas out there to be tried. I don't see why one would wed an idea but ymmv.<br>

😊 I grew up and lived 1st 22yrs in a socialist country, run by the collective leidership of the Communist Party. That didn't work well. Attempts at reform - 3 attempts, 10 years apart - didn't work out. Listening to people now, even people like myself who lived a good portion of their lives in that system - they have forgotten don't remember 90% of the problems then. And this was a moderately enlightened no prison camps no gulags version. People discussing systems of human societies organisation theories miss 99% of things. Only way forward - epistemic humility, assume "no one knows shit" (like movies productions), small scale trial&error experiments, grow things that work out bigger, let the failures die and move on.<br>

Good points there - e.g. our utility companies are already state owned - just not by our state. Wider points related to the above 1) Atm everything uk gov is expensive (==taxes high) b/c the state owns very few assets, so has to rent a lot (e.g like renting a home instead of owning) - argument made by @garyseconomics in "Why Are Taxes So High?" https://youtube.com/watch?v=II1GOhoNpms ; similar 2) UK gov needs to acquire assets, so the income is not exclusively from tax (on labor mostly) but supplemented by (passive) income from assets - by @CJFDillow in https://stumblingandmumbling.typepad.com/stumbling_and_mumbling/2024/06/funding-public-services-a-bevanite-approach.html 3) This links with the wider YIMBY movement "build build build" e.g. @s8mb - brings more people in the tent 4) There is argument to be made that gov owned minority player in every utility sector and or where it touches on national security, as it matches liabilities with assets needed to the discharge the former effectively, avoid blackmails & private sector "slow walks", aids anti-monopoly, maybe aid industrial R&D Re: green tech - sort of "soft" industrial policy for the 21st century https://x.com/ljupc0/status/1796803485695942837 .<br>

Early on there were socialist small scale experiments - communes - that all failed. Marxists' response was to denote them utopian or naive socialism - and to name themselves scientific. So they got around that empirical evidence that way - "disqualifying" them as "unscientific".<br>

Sounds like the state needs to grow assets. It has lost assets with privatizations, selling of housing etc. Now it relies only on income from tax and nothing else. Like a worker deriving 100% income from work, but 0% (passive) income from assets. B/c it owns no assets. Reminded me of "Why Are Taxes So High?" YT episode by @garyseconomics<br>

It's the logic of a continental empire where "more land == better". As opposed to say maritime empire where "more commerce == better". We've not seen one recently - since the demise of Austro-Hungarian and the Ottoman empires. That mode of operation is how Russian Empire became so large by land span too. After the communist experiment failure it's not illogical for Putin to go back to the previous functioning mode of op. The novel 21st century twist (also ushered in with the communist experience) is the negation of any possibility for objective truth (Surkov & co). Merciless lying in industrial quantities - even when near term there's no need for it - is by design, to destroy any possibility to any truth. Note the contrast: US didn't deny they're going to invade Iraq, they were trying to manufacture reasons for. While Russia denied they are going to invade Ukraine (even while invading it). Similarly previously they denied they took Crimea - the "green man".<br>

In the household - they haven't. In the society as leaders etc - men are more talented at more but shallower connections, women are more more talented at fewer but deeper connections. Former favours larger groups, latter favours smaller groups of humans.<br>

It suppresses the old vote instead! 😂😂 I can't but find that delightful&perfect metaphor for the Tory rule.<br>

Yep - spot on!! I oft think of research as re-search: re-peated search for something that works. When applying for funding $$$ on the research applications I always though hilarious that we were asked "what will you discover?". I thought - If I knew for sure, it would not  research then. IDK if it's better of worse for the public to know that say 9 out of 10 attempts will fail miserably, public $$ will be wasted. I think there maybe there's an element of "you can't handle the truth" there. Unlike VC-s for example - who know that most efforts will fail and try to ensure every effort takes sufficient risk, that in the (unlikely event) it succeeds, the payoff is enough to cover the costs of the failures (that will be the majority, as a count).<br>

So - if you do it, you will be the 1st one in the history of humanity to know it's possible. If you fail to do it - the question remains, it's not decided either way. Research - to discover something no-one knew before - is a risky business.<br>

Ok - for the record my thesis is that the strategy of taking at face value what Russia says and believing it 100% (have you considered they maybe lying?) actually may increase the chance of a nuclear war. But as you have not articulated what evidence may sway your opinion, I will stop now. It would be unreasonable of me to continue this discussion.<br>

For the 2nd time: can you fathom, imagine, any evidence that will change your mind about Putin's intentions? Fwiw IDK them for sure, and I don't think any one can possibly know with any degree of certainty (pos incl even Putin himself - plus things change with time anyway).<br>

He has the finger today had it for the past 20 years and will have it till he dies. At any moment in time he can decide to end our world. The Q-uestion is: does this or some other A-ction on the part of the US increase or decrease the risk of him ending the world, and at what horizon? From prior history: in 1939 UK+FR thought they can live with DE+RU dividing central and eastern Europe (CEEu) between themselves, but then they decided they can't actually live with that (and we got WW2 in Eu). During 1945-1990 WEu+US lived just fine with RU ruling over CEEu and that worked well for WEu-US-RU (but not CEEu). Very hard to give definite answer about unknown futures - but def don't think the entire risk is one directional. My personal opinion is Eu+RU are on the slope to war no matter what US does (for war one side to want it suffices - otherwise we'd have had world peace for centuries now) and only way to short circuit that is for Poland+Balts to acquire own independent nuclear deterrent.<br>

One does not have to cover the whole thing, can be done tastefully. E.g. notice polished concrete on kitchen tops. It can be made beautiful - but seems significant number of architects hate beauty. Also solar-punk lush greenery - don't see why they can't go full on with that.<br>

Odgovor od eden emigrant na zapad: ne gledam deka nekoj ima ambicija da ja kolonizira Rusija. Naprotiv, mi lici - da mozat da izgradat nekoj 1km visok dzid na granica, i nikogas poveke da ne slusnat za RU, toa bi go napravile. Na pr. Polska vo NATO - US GB FR DE site bea protiv, na kraj kolku znam poljacite gi ubedija taka sto 1) polska rece OK, vo toj slucaj mora da napravime domasna A-bomba, posto tradicionalno sme lesen plen za RU-DE, nuclear deterrent e prasanje na opstanok za nas; i 2) US konkretno - Klinton na izbori imase swing-states kade ima dosta Polska emigracija, i tuka polskata vlada lobirase "ako US uste e Ne za polska vo NATO, emigracijata ke glasa kontra-Klinton". Vo Centralna-Istocna Evropa ima 120M narod, poveketo sloveni, nekoi pravoslavni, i site se plasat od RU. Makedoncite vo MK imate luksuz da ste daleku od RU pa moze da bidete "confidently wrong" a bez pogolemi posledici. Na sreden rok veruvam deka Polska+Balticki zemji+mozebi Romanija mora da napravat domasna A-bomba, ako ne sakaat da si dobijat RU invazija i da bidat osvoeni. Polska ima ogromno iskustvo i istoriski traumi, pr. "3-te podelbi na Polska".<br>

It will match assets with liabilities. TBS what happens (ideas are two a penny) but it looks like an OK idea to me. Atm UK gov ministers - for better or worse - have a liability that their voters scream at them "my bills have doubled, do something", without having the means to really address it in any meaningful way. Gov can't simply order private providers around. Private providers can go on strike or slow walk anything! 😂😂 (what irony that) They have gov uk by the balls. But - once "gov owned provider of last resort" is in place - the gov is in a position to put a floor to any blackmail of that sort. In any industry where gov has the final responsibility to provide to citizens - it seems reasonable that they must have tools to do so. British Energy looks sensible to me. UK needs a train services providers of last resort and water/utilities too. Just to be on the safe side and not subject to blackmail or worse. These companies should be minority players 10-15% of their industry sectors - not dominant (that would be bad). It will have further +ve effects too. Expertise will be maintained so procurement projects will become better value for money, pressuring private contractors to up their game too. Industry can be steered this-or-that way with gov provider showing the way by doing (rather than gov talking; talk is cheap) - sort of "soft" industrial policy. Plus by doing - many a "seemed a good idea but failed in practice" - will be weeded out early by trying them small scale. Public owned not-for-profit can fit the bill for trial&error using the 3% profit margin for that. The rest of the industry can learn for free. Probably done that way is better than via gov R&D spend. Prob there will be more upsides and downsides, but the basic argument is - match assets to liabilities.<br>

Taa ima parcijalno vrska so objektivnata, ama ne celosno. Analogija - objektivna vistina e 3D objekt. Ama jas so ocite moze da vidam samo 2D preseci na toj objekt. Od tie preseci mozam da napravam 3D rekonstrukcija vo mojata glava - model na objektot. Ama nemam nacin da sum 100% siguren deka toa e verna kopija na 3D objektot. Toa znaci: mozam da zemam 1000 2D preseci na modelot vo mojata glava, i na realniot objekt, i site tie 1000 da se identicni. No pak toa ne e garancija deka koga ke go napravam 1001-viot 2D presek, deka nema da otkrijam razlika megu toj presek na objektot, i na modelot modelot vo mojata glava. Mozam da otkirajam razlika. I tuka nemas spas, nemam 100% siguren nacin da ja znam objektivnata vistina vo smisla - mojot model vo mojata glava e apsolutno verna kopija na realniot objekt. Toa ne znaci deka ne treba da se trudam da modelot bide sto e mozno poveren na objektot. Mnogu e podobro 1001-viot presek da se razlikuva (prvite 1000 identicni), otkolku 3-tiot presek da se razlikuva (a samo prvite 2 identicni).<br>

As a civilian bystander: to me seems MMT is only profound b/c the rest of the Econ profession seems hell bent on digging themselves into ever deeper hole by somehow thinking that accounting identities don't apply to them or that "fiat" (as in "by decree") is somehow up for discussion. Your claim on the IR is a perfect illustration. If UK gov incl BoE wanted to "widow make BoJ style" - they could. Other "bad things" may happen (weak pound importing inflation?), but IR being set at a BoE meeting (and markets can take a hike) is the reality. Feel free to dislike that and use flowery metaphors to obscure that to your hearts content. You're not doing yourself any favors tbh. What's once seen, can't be unseen. That rabbit is out the hat. Professional more general observation: the proven fact that economists forecast notoriously lack any predictive power (they do worse than "forecast == last observed value") while plenty of others (humanities majors including literature and history, electrical engineers, mathematicians, CompSci, etc) make $$$ and living betting on the markets but economics profession as whole does not and media-macro serves as infotainment circus clowns makes me prejudiced against anything economists say when it comes to money $$$. On the "producing stuff" they do much better - imo they should stick to the "stuff" part of the "stuff-for-$$$" exchange. They seems to have a blind spot for the $$$ part.<br>

Ofc patent is publishing - is there anyone that thinks otherwise?? In return for making the invention public, the inventor gets the state to use the law to restrict what others can do with it (for a limited time). That's the whole point of the patent system!! Otherwise everyone would just stick to their trade secrets and keep everything secret publish nothing.<br>

It's a conundrum. Ofc it's easy for us - and I'm a Bim constituent - to say "Bim, don't be swayed by the industry sweet talk, listen to us voters, do the right thing". But Bim got to the position he's at by indeed listening to the industry sweet talk, and ignoring the voters.<br>

Both Taiwan and South Korea need nukes as deterrent asap. US can't be relied on to deter. For - if North Korea nukes Seoul, will US retaliate if SF or LA are under threat? I don't think so and I don't think many people do - regardless of what administration maybe in power in Washington. US was against Israel getting nukes - but then learned to live with that. South Korea and Taiwan are in the same position as Israel: got much more powerful neighbor(s) that have nukes, that are openly and loudly proclaiming their intentions to destroy them. So in any conflict with their nuclear neighbors KR/TW can only draw, defend themselves until the next round - they can never really win. US admins are scared providing even conventional weapons to Ukraine. Ofc that is rational for the US - US can live just fine with Kyev nuked. Same thing with CEEu nations (Ukraine, Poland, the Baltics, Romania - all of the 120M central-eastern Europeans) that are being menaced by RU - they need home grown nuclear deterrent. US will not protect them, but ofc will try to prevent them from getting it. This is rational for the US - in the same way it is rational for those nations to acquire nuclear deterrent.<br>

Ofc trade secrets are not patents - they remain secret. :-) In return - I'd expect to be a lot less protection in law for them. Industrial R&D results were usually a) trade secrets; or b) patents, until this latest trend in AI-ML where a lot is also c) published in journals. I love that option (c)! Spilling (most of) the beans freely for the widest possible gain. :-) Previously I was in industrial R&D lab where most was (b) patented, but now I'm in quant trading R&D where there is zero of that and is all (a) trade secrets.<br>

Making it public is necessary, as in literal "pub-lishing". It's not necessary to be in a journal, let alone a peer reviewed journal. It can be published on a home page, on a blog, in a twitter message, :-) personal correspondence, as a patent (e.g. most of industrial R&D), etc. Ofc - a lot of published claims turned out not to be reproducible which is the 1st step for the rest of us to accept the claim to truthfulness. So they fail at the 1st hurdle.<br>

Instead of trying to scrap it - which is I presume very hard given the extent of the captured lawmaking now - maybe tweak the rules to have 60% go to the recepient but 40% go to the opponent? Or some such less than 100% split. (credit to @wbmosler)<br>

For me personally - yes. Have not had false-negative spam breach gmail for ages now. Checking my Spam gmail folder now - about dozen true-positives, zero false-positives. These days even when I get some half-spammy email from a mailing list that I have not knowingly subscribed, when I tell Gmail "this is spam", it recognizes that it's a mailing list, and offers to unsubscribe me from the mailing list. I love that.<br>

The train is already private and there are T&C in place the dirty-boots-on-seat person agreed to when buying the ticket. The person is breaking the T&C no doubt about it. If there's a train steward or transport police present at that (time,place) - they will sort him. But it's not possible to have enforcers all the time everywhere. Total surveillance where the train CCTV is monitored by enforcement system (e.g. neural nets watching the feed) and then enforcers dispatched is one option.<br>

My best guess is - incentives. I read today 0.1% of the accounts generate 80% of the traffic on the platform. So kicking out any of the prolific ones is costly. On the other hand, users complain about silly-bots (porn, crypto, elonmuskXXX) but no-one actually quits - it's low level grumbling. Kicking out a legit user by mistake also creates no end of trouble big stink. So small +ve (users stop grumbling), but a big -ve (removing big acc that create most of the traffic, legit users making lots of noise).<br>

True that. I see 16K COs in WW1, 60K COs in WW2. IDK, I can only offer counterfactuals. Rules are malleable, attuned to survival of the group, and groups that don't survive - we never learn about them. Like if the number of COs was in millions, to the point of the nation not being able to organize an army and defend itself, two things can happen: 1) rules get changed so the COs number is reduced and the nation defends itself in the war and survives; or 2) the nation is defeated, taken over by the foe nation that had different rules (ones facilitating fielding an army). Either way - new rules survive that keep the number of COs low as to the defense of the nation is possible. Why not zero COs? It's too much of an effort for not a lot of gain as long as enough of non-COs are available to serve. Allowing for small non-zero number of COs is a positive for the legitimacy of the rest of the recruitment process too.<br>

Yeah not showing replies, hiding replies from me even when I click on the reply icon, seems way way more evil to me!? And mostly needless imo?? I understand they think they're increasing engagement by boosting angry and polemical - but does that translate to more advertising $$$? I doubt anyone has shown that for sure. Also - reading replies past level-1 or -2 is but impossible. So I try to remind myself not to post any at more than level-1 deep. (breaking that rule now 😂) We'd better off if they just showed all replies at level-1 or even not allowing for >1 levels given their threaded replies reader is difficult to use. I have check notifications to check if any interesting answers - but then notifications do not always work 100% reliably afaics but maybe user error too that I miss some sometimes.<br>

Government hand is weakened by BoE independence. BoE can side with the (bond) markets rather than the Treasury and bring the gov down. Example Truss-the-lettuce, counterexample Bank of Japan the-widow-maker. Other things are important too - e.g. Japan probably does not import as much inflation as UK would if the pound were to weaken.<br>

That was very good, enjoyed watching it - thanks for that. Are humans only animals we know of that are capable of symbolic processing? I get that all animals (incl humans) are capable of neural processing. Given machine symbolic processing is more capable than humans' - does this imply that even an imperfect union of symbolic and neural machine may be able to better humans overall? Where the neural part is merely on par with humans, and the symbolic portion more advanced.<br>

Unfortunately for all - not anytime soon and certainly not before a military defeat. Even elected politicos stumble on a "worse is better" +ve feedback loop, they discover it by trial&error (US Trump now, UK BoJo previously, I observed it personally in YU'90s), the steps are: 1) Identify a grievance, a fissure, something that hurts 2) praise the wound open, drill in, make it hurt more 3) campaign on that pain, get elected 4) do not heal the wound - on the contrary, make it worse & more painful 5) come next election - accuse your enemies of (a) causing the pain (b) preventing you from healing the wound 6) get elected by a bigger majority. Repeat the cycle. For a king-for-life like Putin now it's even more advantageous - permanent war secures the throne no questions asked. War is much easier much simpler for a king to do than say a slow betterment of the country.<br>

I look at Putin's conscript army and think - not a good idea. Ideals you cherish and trust you crave are instilled by transparency, honesty, good deeds in public life. Semi-enslaved labor may divide our society further and the young-old gap already showing may grow into a a chasm. There is volunteering and charity work available now. Conflating army with helping old grannies is a misdirection that ill serves us. Army service is not weekend creche, soldiers are not kids. Their job is to kill people they have never met before and have personally nothing against. They are given training and equipment by the state and social permission by the society to do so. It's not volunteering - people that refuse it in peace time are jailed, and in war time they are shot. When imagining possibilities, thinking of the best case is going easy on yourself. We'd be better off if you'd steelman your argument. Imagine king Boris Johnson having at his beck and call fully trained well armed competent 2M soldiers strong army. To me the present reality where King BoJo lacks the means to indulge his exuberant fantasies seems better.<br>

They are like porn - easy for us to recognise it when seen, hard for us to describe algorithmically for the computers to weed out. I thought that the latest crop of big ML models would have solved it? Previously - spam has been solved (by e.g  Google) with way simpler models.<br>

If it's not military - than it's not a national service really as far as I understand it. There is volunteering and charity work available now. Imo professional army is way better investment. Better to enlarge that one than waste resource on conscripts. I think conflating army with helping old grannies is a misdirection that ill serves us. Army service is not weekend creche, soldiers are not kids. Their job is to kill people they have never met before and have personally nothing against. They are given training and equipment by the state and social permission by the society to do so. It's not volunteering - people that refuse it in peace time are jailed, and in war time they are shot. I did 1yr national service at 18yo. Only really useful thing there was I got to observe a cross-section of society I wouldn't have observed otherwise. Saw many functionally illiterate, dumb to the point of being danger to themselves, people, as well as a small share of truly evil psychopaths, but also good, honest and rare brilliant guys. Made me appreciate the role of selection as well as education. Also prob got a foretaste how life maybe if I ever find myself imprisoned. Other than that, as in actual war fighting skills - it was a total waste of time. It convinced me that any conscript army will be routed by a professional foe in a real war.<br>

I did 1yr national service at 18 and I'm not in favor of it. It seemed like waste of time. I learned ~1.5 useful things. The full 1 point - got to observe a cross-section of society I wouldn't have observed otherwise. Saw many functionally illiterate, dumb to the point of being danger to themselves, people, as well as a small share of trully evil psychopaths, but also good, honest and rare brilliant guys. Made me appreciate the role of selection as well as education. And 0.5 half-point is - got a foretaste how life maybe if I ever find myself imprisoned. Professional army is way better investment. Better to enlarge that one than waste resource on conscripts.<br>

Eh 😀 Took the entirety of humanity thousands of years to accept "no - we on earth are not the center of the universe", "no - we humans are not special in the shape of god but just like other animals branch on the tree of life", now we are at "no - we are not the only intelligent entities" (will take some time to bed) and so on. Personally it's but impossible for any single of us to figure "no - I'm not *that* special" (given if 9B are special, then no one is special). Likewise we are usually surprised when we die ("did you think people that died yesterday - it did not occur to them to just not die??"). Our egos loom so large in our view that little space is left for the rest of the world that is not "me, myself and I". So the idea that most of us think "my data is special" is not surprising really. There's a fine but rarely quoted early book on data "Data for the People" by an early ML researcher and Amazon chief scientist early on arguing that rather than us individuals restricting our data use, we should demand that organizations (businesses, governments) open up their data to *us*, and that way balance the power relation individual-vs-group where I the individual am at a disadvantage as a weaker party.<br>

Do you think Russia maybe lying? Or even say things that mean one thing to you, and different to them? Like when they say "NATO threatens our security", they're not afraid that Poland is going to invade towards Moscow. Rather they mean "we can't put the politico of our choice for a PM, we can't control the parliament, we can't control the government of Poland". As they say with UKR. Regardless - CEEuropeans should be less reliant on US both conventional and nuclear. Don't think US will risk nuclear Armageddon if Russia nukes Warsaw. There are 120M CEEuropeans - they are responsible for themselves and their security. If they are lazy and do nothing - they will find themselves enslaved by Moscow once more. This is existential to them in a way that is not to WEuropeans.<br>

Russia has borders as do other countries. Maybe not ideal - but good enough. With largest nuclear arsenal in the world - I don't take the argument that Russia is afraid of another Napoleon or Hitler invasion. They are lying mercilessly. CE Europe countries can only ever lose-or-draw without a nuclear deterrent. I'm amazed Poland and the Baltics and Romania too are not developing their own nuclear deterrent. They stand to pay dearly for that dunder headed stupidity. If Israel and North Korea could do it - CEEus can do it too. They are faced with similar existential threat. Also they should be spending ~10% on defence and building their armies. Russia has spelled out their intentions many times over many years.<br>

Dumping them in the rubbish bin will not force insolvency, no? 😄 And if you take them to the Fed/Treasury - the Fed can always create new $$$ on their spreadsheet (no shortage of numbers there) and exchange your bonds for $$$ that it will credit your Reserve Account with. Afaik any insolvency can only be voluntary: The Fed - or Treasury, or ultimately the USG - to voluntarily decide not to honor them and default on them. Other bad things may happen (or not) with the extra $$$ in your reserve account. Just involuntary insolvency is not one of those things.<br>

We had kids when it was worth it to us, and now we don't have them anymore for the same reason.<br>
It's still worth it for the very poor (no opportunity cost) and very rich (can hire help), but not the middle.<br>
When the society wants more of something, usually it tries to remove the obstacles preventing it. Ideas - ask less effort and perfection from parents (c.f. @bryan_caplan), recognize more the enormous effort (time, money, emotion) parents put into raising the next generation. Econ incentives oft get a mention, but tbh what's offered as compensation is miniscule compared to the real opportunity cost to the middle class parents.<br>

Yes b/c they have the gigantic nuclear armed Russia next door hell bent on subjugating them as well as within living memory invasions (Germany, Russia). Last invasion UK suffered was 1066. Do you really want millions of young people under arms, at the beck and call of supremely cynical yet imbecilic leaders deployable at short notice? Isn't nuclear deterrent enough for defense? Maybe better to not increase the temptation to future PM-s more than necessary? Can you imagine a capable leader like "the hand of history" Tony Blair leading a 2M soldier strong army? The possibility for a massive f*ck ups level WW2 x10 times, x100 times are not to be underestimated.<br>

@GilesYeo maybe an expert in many things, but for sure "obesity and the brain control of food intake" are not on that list. For an expert knows how to design the system s/he is an expert own, how to build it from scratch, how to alter it, how to bend it to our will. Lack of expertise in this is not shameful - as no experts exist nor have ever existed (afaik) on obesity. More introspection less self-aggrandizement would be more in keeping with the evidence on expertise and would not go amiss. I expect more honesty from scientists (allotted some privilege by society) than say the snake oil selling businessman an Apprentice wannabe. More honesty please.<br>

Good health being top-1 priority is lost on those that are in good health so they'll be oblivious to it. 😂😂😂 I understand the puzzlement.

One surprising thing: while "no teaching" would feel an excellent proposition, there are downsides: contact with young people is refreshing they have new ideas, also explaining my stuff to other people is excellent means to reconsider: do I really understand myself what's happening there.<br>

I haven't needed integer INF tbh. But I regularly use INT_MIN as a standin for INT_NAN. Imo it's handy for every type to have one out-of-band special value: NULL for pointers, NAN for floats, for indices maybe 0, for char-s '\0' maybe? IDK about bool-s, nothing convenient there. If for nothing else but to have un-initialized variables initialized to that invalid value. For me float NAN-s are a life saver (I do lots of data work). There is hardware support, and every value they touch is turned into a NAN so they spread like a wildfire. Which is exactly what I want to detect data errors.<br>

It is mostly - on my favorite definition "nation is the largest group of people, where the losing 49% trust the winning 51% enough that they accept their will for limited time". But with few cracks: the above is not true for Northern Ireland. If Scotland didn't have devolution - for how much longer would they have tolerated being ruled by Tory-dominated Westminster when Scots have not voted Tory majority for half a century. Fwiw the this is just a function of the north-south population sizes disbalance, don't think there is anything much that can be done.<br>

Counterpoint: where things improve by even single digits percent annually, it's for the better. I got un/lucky when the airline lost delayed my skis once. Had to rent skis and realised my old skis (~10 yrs) were really really bad. The technology had moved on, a mid-level contemporary ones were better on every axis of consideration than my old high-end ones by lesser or greater amount - but better. Was lucky to be taught a lesson.<br>

... also NB I'm not advocating to "run the energy market". That's fools errand, there is no need nor demand for it. No need to be 100% of the market. But being 0% of the market is equally untenable position. The state can own some small player (e.g. 10-15%) so to retain institutional capability.<br>

Easiest and fastest to get it off the ground is to buy one of the smaller ones (==cheaper; can create new from scratch - but no need to). IDK what the current state of the market is. Thought when Bulb went bust - that was the ideal moment for the state to step in and acquire it (customers assets liabilities - the whole lot) for £1.<br>

A minimal yet workable solution is - a supplier of last resort for every natural monopoly. It's futile regulating when a private monopoly has you over a barrel. Given the public holds gov responsible for water energy insurance etc - then gov must have non-zero means to deliver those. Gov can't be dependent on the same interests it's supposed to be antagonistic to. Gov does not have to be the only provider - let 1000 flowers bloom. But gov must have at least 1 iron in that fire. As it's held responsible by the public for the industry level outcomes in the end. For many reasons - applying pressure, retaining expertise, influencing and shaping the direction of the industry so it does not degenerate into a mafia-like pillaging cartel, standsrds, transparency etc. Ceding entire strategic industry to 100% private interests is too risky it's asking for trouble. There's a happier more middle of the road ground.<br>

You can set the interest rate to 0 and solve that. That may create a new problem of private lending boom. Will have to fight that e.g. maybe credit limits to mortgages, limits to personal loans etc. Can be done. But Basic Income for the rich via high IR on gov bonds is politically hard to shift.<br>

🎯🎯 100% EVen more - not only is oil bought from an OPEC cartel or rogues like RUS - that collude with the cartel anyways so we pay 100-300% markup! - but in order to buy the said oil, a country needs to get USD 1st, that in itself is a monopoly item issued by a monopolist (US). So not 1, but 2 chokeholds will be circumvented. In contrast, electricity can be produced by variety of non-oil sources that countries can build themselves. EV-s doing  God's work here increasing the freedom in the world and decreasing the power of bullies that rule over us by means of constricting stuff we need to live. Technology FTW! 😄<br>

You are right that fossil fuels are necessary for prosperity. You are wrong in not seeing that switching cars to EV - so they don't spend the valuable fossil fuels  when not abs necessary! - is a good thing. Ethiopia will not be forced to buy oil from a cartel. Ethiopia will not be forced to find USD that are needed for the oil from a monopolist issuer (US). Save the pain of importing fossil fuels for fertilizer and such. Ethiopia can generate electricity itself and from multiple sources (incl nuclear) in a way that it can not produce oil. Hopefully in 5-10yrs EV-s will be 1/2 the current price and go double the distance so no-one in their right mind would prefer ICE to EV car.<br>

Ego. Their egos are too large. Each of us has to draw a line between "myself" and "not-myself" (not myself is "the rest", the "world ex-myself"). Reality is that "not-myself", and for them it's very small. Most of the viewspace in their view is taken by "myself".<br>

That's the 1st group originating the idea - the "baptists". But imo the implementation is taken on by a 2nd group - the "bootleggers": shrinking is done by outsourcing the functions to private companies that bootleggers control & charge a lot while providing little. Us the public get the worst outcome: state still spends gargantuan amounts of £££, we get no services and bad value for £££. But the "bootleggers" make a fortune in the process. Looks to me the current Torry party is the conduit for this looting.<br>

TBH that's low on my list. If this is of interest - imo @bengoldacre https://opensafely.org is a solution that looks like it might work for all. Myself - I'm for radical transparency, I'd be actually delighted if anyone cared about my BP, weight, sugar, DNA etc measurements. I'm happy to give them away for free, to anyone. (as well as my body - just not yet, I need it atm still being alive 😆 ) The problems are much more trivial: there is no way for me to upload the timeseries of my BP, sugar levels, weight, etc to give them my DNA sequences to anyone on the health system (NHS). And so there is 0 possibility that any of that data that I have can help me.<br>

Uh-oh FO stage of the FAFO journey of discovery that started with "reduce the state to the size where I can drag it into the bathroom and drown it in the bathtub". Libertarians & communists are like children in the idea "let's destroy the state" without much concern how are its functions to be implemented the day after. Time for Leviathan re-discovery re-reading? Seems it's on an about 40 years cycle.<br>

You should really campaign for radical transparency: every document every spreadsheet every diary of every politician and civil servant public on the web by default, to start with. Too many monsters having too easy a ride monstering over us plebs. To start with - let's make it easier for all to see the monsters at work. Other better things may follow.

Total surveillance FTW. Rotten apple spoils the barrel. The more advanced the society, the more brittle & fragile it is, as the dependency networks grow vast with the specialisation increase necessary for advancement. Now the group, the society, has the means to defend itself from the feral individual. Quite the roles reversal compared to the 20th century - where the individual got crushed by the group.<br>

In the UK - us patients don't own our data afaik. There's a tussle whether 1) the GP - who collects it, or 2) the Health ministry gov uk - who pays for the collection, own it. Us 3) patients/subjects the data describes - are a distant third. Afaics the first two seem disinterested and terrible at quality control of my data. While making it but impossible for me to correct the errors in it. (pos former consequence of the latter) Imo "Data for the People" by an early ML guy/Amazon executive is a good book not known widely enough concerning all things personal data.<br>

Self sufficiency is resilience, not efficiency - and usually self sufficiency is antagonistic to efficiency. The more we specialise, the more efficient we get, but also more dependent we become, on ever larger number of people. And we increase the risk of not getting what we need from those people we rely on. There is a tradeoff between the two - higher reward is achieved via ever narrower specialisation, but that increases the pool of others we depend on, and exposes us to an ever larger risk of the relations breaking down (for whatever reason) and us being unable to get from others stuff we need from them to survive.<br>

@RishiSunak This country the people ultimately all of us vest powers into politicians and yourself. You are to use those powers to improve our lives where we are unable to do on our own against forces larger than each of us individually. You're doing badly at exercising those powers atm. You're not elected so to get re-elected, that's not the idea. It's not your day job to fight the next election. Leave that to someone else, as it'll be someone else in a years' time anyway. Why would you not use the limited time you were allotted mostly by fortune to do good & meaningful, I shall never understand.<br>

Yes monopolies are indefensible & the fail point of current neo/liberalism. More interesting - competition itself leads to winners and losers (fine), winners survive losers go bust (oh-key), then winners find it's cheaper to conspire & monopolize than fight to the death (bad). It's to do with the number N of players. When N is large, conspiring << competition. When N gets sufficiently small, conspiring >> competition. I would love to see any models or math about this - if anyone has any, please share. It's almost never that monopolists get in a smokey back room to hatch their cunning plans. No - usually the few N left converge on the monopolist strategy without much explicit coordination.<br>

If they wanted neutrality or being ruled by RUS - they can lay down arms & stop fighting, right? That's easy. The fact that they rather fight & die than become part of RUS tells us otherwise.

Wish it was what you think it is, but afraid you misunderstand. From RUS perspective, not controlling UKR (==the government, the PM, the parliament) *is* a "root cause". So "addressing the root cause" for RUS means "control over UKR". If they can achieve that by non-military means, than all the better for them, they are not against that. Now UKR-s citizens etc seem to disagree with that, and the pro-Europe, anti-RUS part of UKR seem to have been ascendant (from about equal 50:50 in ~2010). Hence the current clash. Since the full invasion seems to me the pro-RUS side has been thoroughly discredited and has lost all support in UKR. RUS can not achieve control over UKR (this is what they want, b/c they think it's what they need) without military means anymore.<br>

Why is it so bad than? What is all that funding going into? Is the money siphoned by private providers via high prices? Is it friends&family firms of gov ministers and torry donors that are getting the money? Is it a classic torry looting of the public purse covid PPI style?<br>

Vo MK se koristi "teroristi" bez vrska, ne znam zasto. Da podmetnea bomba vo parlament - ke bea teroristi. Bidejki ne podmetnaa, ne go dignaa parlamentot vo vozduh - ne mi lici deka se teroristi. Isto i Ahmeti ONA vo 2001-va: da podmetnuvaa bombi vo avtobusi na JSP da gi digaa skopjani vo vozduh - togas ke bea teroristi. A bidejki ne go pravea toa - ne se teroristi, tuku se buntovnici, gerilci sto se krenale na bunt protiv drzavata.<br>

The grift that keeps on giving. Ever since the dynamic duo of Dave+George aided & abetted by their sidekicks Nick+Alexander got in on a false premise (that GFC'08 was Brown's fault) we are being punished for our original sin. Also fitting true to form that their flagship econ policy was imbecile-macro "fix nothing while the sun shines". Youthful telegenic looks go a long way. Alas beauty is not truth.<br>

Come off the high horse pls. You are not as important as you think, you are not all powerful. Not everything that happens is West's will incarnated. Other countries have their own will/interests and act on it. The great opening of China in WTO was a great success for China - largest number of people ever in history lifted out of poverty. Worked as with other Asian tigers - import capital, export produce, develop manufacturing. It seemed CCP has institutional capacity to ensure leaders' (president + vice) rotations every 5yrs. This was a good feedback loop addressing revealed fails, bringing new blood & ideas, fixing & improving. That worked well until Xi. Now with Xi an infallible king for life the virtuous cycle will slow down and then stop. Russia was effectively getting technology+infrastructure financed by Europe in exchange for the oil+gas so to modernize and catch up. Build a modern state on the ruins of the SU. Again the system got captured by one Putin becoming king for life.  Once a king, the easiest way of securing the throne is permanent war. War is much easier for a king than a slow betterment of the country. Not much anyone else can do about that. European states disarmed since 1990 and the risk of another world war starting there diminished. Now that's all reversing slowly, european countries are starting to build up their armies again.<br>

Heh - as a practicing industry researcher I wish more of stuff like "Happy Accidents: Serendipity in Major Medical Breakthroughs in the Twentieth Century" (by Morton Meyers) was presented to young scientists, and less hypothesis falsification and similar. Oft history is taught backwards, from the tail end to the discovery to the beginning, and in that rear-view, there is indeed only a single path. And it looks very ordered too, very certain! But in reality the process of discovery is anything but! Looking forward there are many many paths one can take, and oft it's the "gut feeling", or "well didn't expect that where did that come from" that decide which one we take. And luck plays a huge role in whether we fail or succeed to discover something. True tjay one needs to be open and position oneself to benefit from a bit of a good luck. I like the Feynman take "it starts with a guess", we guess "it's so-and-so" :-)<br>

I can imagine I-a-doomsday-er confusing my own mortality (after becoming aware of it) with the end of the world, b/c I'm still the narcissist I started as a baby & have not grown that much out of it. Most humans - and esp once we start aging - we are all like this to a degree, not a biggie. RAT people being talented & precocious - this may happen to them earlier than the rest? Oft I wonder why aim for less-than-the-max, why assume merely end of the world rather than say end of the universe? :-)<br>

Ofc - that does not mean we should treat everything a mystery. Where we have deterministic knowledge (the conditional pdf p(y|x) of the forecast y for observation x is a Dirac \delta impulse) - then great, we know both which one (as well as how many), gfi. Where we have probabilistic knowledge (=puzzle) - oh-key, not the best, but we know the conditional pdf p(y|x) to some degree, can count how many, even if we don't know which one. If used well we can do better than ignoring it imo. Where we don't even have probabilistic knowledge (=mystery), we know nothing about the conditional pdf p(y|x) (possibly b/c we have no knowledge of the joint pdf p(x,y)) - well tough, and deluding ourselves that we know something will make us even worse, so def don't do it, assume nothing.<br>

Looks like misaligned incentives problem. If £££ is spend badly - then HMT bad (rightly). If £££ is not spent, and growth and gains are foregone, opportunity is missed - then that does not count against HMT. So HMT will always see risk (that's ok), but fail to see any gains - no?<br>

Citing "Radical Uncertainty" by Mervyn King and John Kay - I'm reminded of this https://unherd.com/2020/02/the-madness-of-mervyn-kings-uncertainty/ . Let's not throw the baby with the bathwater, let's not conflate and jump from "bad unrepresentative objective and or stupid optimization" into "well anything goes so here's me fortune telling via chicken entrails". The latter is not as good as measuring, counting, classifying. The fact that we don't have deterministic knowledge everywhere should not stop us using the probabilistic knowledge where we have it. Equally - where we don't even have probabilistic knowledge, we should refrain from acting as if we do.<br>

Easy. Puzzle = we know the p.d.f. with some certainty, it's "aleatoric uncertainty". Mystery = we don't know the p.d.f. with any certainty, it's "epistemic uncertainty". So with a puzzle we can define a measure of a tradeoff, and then optimize for it. Not so with a mystery.<br>

Too strong a claim. There maybe a formula. We can distinguish 2 cases there, between a puzzle = a formula exists, and a mystery = a formula does not exist.<br>

... indeed - but you have to then define the tradeoff explicitly. How much \sigma^2 increase are you willing to pay for one unit of \mu increase? That in itself is a step up from most discussions that are either on \mu or \sigma^2 but rarely on both. As if most people can hold 1 idea in their head fine, but holding 2 ideas simultaneously is a bridge too far.<br>

Maybe there isn't one, or maybe we will find the .gov @elonmusk-incarnate, but: it sure will not come while people spend all their time and energy debating "where will the $$$ come from". Governments need to raise their game, become better smarter not only at their spending, but at everything they're doing. Yes it's a tough almost impossible constraint that a state can not die and then be replaced with a better one as easily as is the case of a company. But - TINA! Not a question of more- or less- - but a question of better as opposed to worse. Atm much of .gov stuff is sh*t all around the world. Private sector raised its game massively since 1980. Now the .gov sector needs to do the same. Shrink the .gov so it can be drowned in a bathtub failed, as then we got "private actors organize to provide functions like law, order, defense" i.e. we end up with a .gov anyway, only controlled by 1$-1vote rather than 1human-1vote.<br>

Ofc there are.

The free market and globalization is part of the mechanism that lifted 100s of millions of Chinese out of Maoist poverty too tbh. And before them did the same for other Asian tigers. Agreed we are at the end of that road to due to issues of national security. But before getting too cheery let's remember the 1st age of globalization in 190x was succeeded by two world wars.<br>

People that got RTM - are there any examples or data about the SC before and after? I have a nagging suspicion that about a half of my bill is fraudulent. But I have to work for a living and don't have the time nor the energy to chase after the SC. Esp seems futile given we can't do anything really about it until we go RTM.<br>

Easy. Your current "patria" is your nation state. Patriotism is solidarity within your nation. Your nation is the largest group of people, that you trust enough, so that you as part of the losing 49% accept the will of the winning 51%. Solidarity means through accepting taxes you will work for benefit of random people you have never met or seen and you will never do, just b/c they are members of your nation. And that - in balance - is a good thing.<br>

You can, everyone can - just write on a piece of paper "I owe you xyz". That's easy. The hard part is making other people accept your piece of paper. As in - exchange stuff we all like (food, shelter, cars, computers) for those IOUs.<br>

Alternative - Obama was as ignorant as he was arrogant. Two world wars started in Europe over "a quarrel in a faraway country, between people of whom we know nothing". Doubt Obama knows something that elided a succession of British statesmen ending with Chamberlain & Churchill.<br>

It's preferable to articulate your thoughts in affirmative so one can discuss and leave allegories home. If discussion is what you are after. West helped China economy Deng reforms by opening for trade and exporting capital post 1990 -<br>
> China in WTO was a great success for China, largest number of people ever lifted out of poverty.<br>
Chine took the opportunity and used it well as did other Asia tigers before them. The West does not mind the leadership either way, it's each country's business - China and Russia can have their kings for life as they please. EU didn't stop doing business with Russia after Putin extra terms, nor after Crimea annexation 2014. None of that was important to them. The line is drawn at security. Once China and Russia threaten and or start wars - then considerations of security take precedence over free trade and prosperity. It's exactly the same how countries around the world get nervous when US invades smaller countries. Everyone gets nervous about their own security. Hence we see pull back and re-shoring of national industrial capacity. E.g. US funding help building TSMC and Samsung chip factories on US soil and so on. Europe is way behind (as ever), even if they are in bigger danger objectively (no ocean separates them from RU). Russia economy is already on war footing, and the population is propagandized and prepared for a push into the rest of Eastern Europe.<br>

Not to worry. The ships are never going to happen, so there will be no crew shortages. Building takes effort and organization, lots of people inspired to work pull together. Incompetent crooks can't do any of that, that's why they never build anything.<br>

That's the direction of travel. West's idea that China & Russia can join in prosperity through free trade is reaching end of road. China in WTO was a great success for China, largest number of people ever lifted out of poverty. It seemed CCP has institutional capacity to ensure leaders' (president and vice) rotations every 5yrs. This was a feedback loop addressing revealed fails, bringing new blood and ideas, fixing and improving. That worked until Xi. Now with an infallible king for life, the virtuous cycle will slow down and then stop. It takes one talented and ruthless individual to derail, unfortunately. Russia was effectively getting technology and infrastructure financed by Europe in exchange for the oil so to modernize and catch up. Build a modern state on the ruins of the SU. Again the system got captured by one Putin becoming king for life. Once a king, the easiest way of securing the throne is a permanent war. War is much easier for a king than a slow betterment of the country. Not much anyone else can do about that. European states disarmed since 1990 and the risk of another world war starting there diminished. Now that's all reversing slowly, european countries are starting to build up their armies again.<br>

Da - imame familii rodnini i prijateli i mozebi imot, znaci imame nekoj interes ne e deka ne ne interesira, ama - toa ne e dovolno. Dijaspora e ok da ima nekoj pasos nekakva vrska so maticnata zemja, ama deka ne treba da glasa i ne treba mnogu da se mesa vo tekovna politika. Idea vodilka kako da se reguliraat odnosite so dijaspora treba da e - edinstvo. (na pr grckata dijaspora taka e nekako organizirana) Kako sto e sega MK dijaspora - em ne-edinstvoto od MK se preleva vo dijasporata, em dijasporata negativno vlijane na maticata vo MK i pridonesuva za dodatni razdori. Generalno - pomalku zborenje poveke rabota za nas dijasporci.

Kolku razbiram, opasnosta e ovaa. Namerata na BG e da gi natera so milo ~500K-600K makedonci da stanat bugari preku razni povlastici. Kako i dosega so EU pasosi - iako nikoj od niv ne se pisuva i na popis BG-in (ama gledas imase reakcii od BG "kade se tie so BG-ski pasosi, sto gi nema"). Utre so davanje 300 Eur na popis, na pr. Mozebi so kvalitetno bugarsko osnovno i sredno skolo, mozebi i fakultet vo BG. Verojatno imaat i drugi nacini +vno da deluvaat (za niv). Otkako ke se napravi podloga za vlijanie - ke ima i politicki baranja. Racunam ultimativno BG ideal e - MK da pobara pripojuvanje kon BG.<br>
So voenite zlostornici nema takva opasnost. So GR i severna isto nemase. Kvalitetno sredno skolo ima tursko Jahja Kemal - ama decata nema da gi preobrati vo turci i sl (golema e distancata makedonec do turcin).<br>
Dodatno - kolku podolgo BG ja blokira MK, tolku poveke gorniot plan se realizira. Po primerot so BG pasosi - kolku podolgo MK ne e vo EU, tolku poveke MK-ci zemaat BG pasos. Da bese MK vo EU - nieden MK-ec nemase da vadi BG pasos. Pa taka BG ima motiv, im e vo korist, nikogas da ne ja odblokiraat MK. Posto kolku podolgo, tolku poveke MK-ci ke stanuvaat BG-ri.<br>
Ne kazuvam deka taka ke bide, ne mozam da vidam vo idninata ne znam - kazuvam mozebi toa e BG planot.<br>
Lekot za MK (i za WB6) e - ne priem vo EU (toa ne e mozno sega), tuku dil kako Shvajcarija: priem vo Schengen zona, ostvaruvanje na 4-slobodi, priem vo zednicki paza i verojatno carinskata zona. Ako mozat MK-cite da rabotat i ziveat slobodno vo EU - nema da imaat potreba ni od EU priem niti od BG pasos. Ova @rumeliobserver dobro go artikulira vo https://esiweb.org/proposals/offer-four-freedoms-balkans-ukraine-and-moldova .<br>
Ne znam nisto za BG politika znam kolku e realen planot opisan pogore. No delot so BG pasosi bese staven vo pogon i se ostvaruva(se?). Mu veruvam na @rumeliobserver , mene scenarioto mi lici verojatno. Citajki sto pisuvaat i pro-zapadno orientirani liberalni BG-ri so simpatii kon nas kako @DimitarBechev , mi lici tie uste se vo filmot od pred-1991 deka "MK-cite se tvorba na Tito, sega ke se setat deka se BG-ri i ke se vratat kon maticata". Bi sakal da gresam.<br>

It's in your powers @BimAfolami , you got elected on this - abolish leasehold, you have the votes in the Parliament, what are you waiting for? UK/acc is doing stuff, JUST_DO_IT stop waffling & time wasting in endless discussions. You have reports, commissions, recommendations etc going back quarter a century, plus 5M affected leaseholders - just do it.

It's just like they are all NPC-s careful to never do anything and so never make any errors or create problems by doing stuff. Just zero-risk-zero-return strategy.

Daft take. Coming close to 45 years as Tito's been dead. Apparently there were Macedonians both before and after him. Is there a point where you accept that maybe things are not as they seem to you?

Heh - the dynamic duo Dave+George, aided and abetted by Nick+Danny, had majority of the elite & country supporting them in their macro-economically imbecilic policy of "not fixing the roof". Consequences come long after they are all gone having successfully federred their nests.<br>

This Apple ad is what happens when you try to be “edgy” with no consideration for strategy.<br>
Consider first principles:<br>
1) Apple is a brand built on giving people a sense of inspiration and joy (eg, the colorful 2000s iPod ads)<br>

They are corrupt (not stupid), but the level of their gain from the corruption compared to the loss to the public purse is so out of whack, that people have hard time believing. Like for personal gain of 100-200K p.a. paid via directoriship on some "board" over 5-20 years, they will generate x1000 times revenue for the company and probably x10-x20 times profit p.a. And this kind of "soft corruption" scheme will be on the right side of the law, they will not be breaking the letter of the law.<br>

Zapadot ne "resi deka ni treba demokratija". YU bese vo krizi - ekonomska, politicka - od 1970-ta pa navamu. Komunistickata partija bese svesna, toa ne se kriese - naprotiv, celo vreme se pisuvase za toa. Sto da se pravi, kako da se resat problemite. Obidi i pocetoci na reformi imase sekoi 10 godini: '70, '80, '90. Reformite bea vo nasoka na ekonomski - minimalno liberaliziranje (samoupravuvanje), politicki - decentralizacija i davanje vlast na Republikite. Ekonomskite reformi propagaa vo momentot koga starata garda stvarno trebase dobrovolno da se otkaze od kontrola na firmite i na parite. Retrospektivno gledano - mozebi osnovano uplaseni deka ponovite generacii se nespisobni banditi? Nejse - koga vo '90 konecno propadna komunizmot, i istocniot blok i sovetskiot sojuz, branata konecno popusti, i partijata dozvoli konkurencija vo politikata i registracija na drugi partii. I togas pak lideri na najgolemite partii bea site stari partiski kadri - Kucan, Tugman, Milosevic. Zapadot da imase nekoja uloga i sila, ke bea najgolemi partii nekoi kako Liberalna na Gorge Marjanovic. Ne sme tolku vazni pa Zapadot da se sekira za nas. A i da se sekira, pak posto narodot glasa vo demokratija, tie liberalni partii nikogas ne dobivaa poveke od 5-7% - i stalno se minorni. Toj sto imase poddrska od Zapadot bese Ante Markovic, posleden PM na federalnata vlada, sto ja liberalizira ekonomijata i konecno imavme zejtin, WC hartija, mleko, detergenti i sl vo prodavnici (prethodno vo mnogu navrati nemase, imase restrijcii na struja, nemase benzin se vozese par-nepar vo vremeto na programata za "stabilizacija" na ekonomijata na Milka Planinc), luge otvorija million mali biznisi i konecno mozea da rabotat sto sakaat ako sakaat. Politicki negovata partija dobi poddrska nesto 1-2% na izborite, znaci skoro nula. Site ovie raboti gledam se zaboraveni.<br>

That the organisation expands together with the revenue expansion, it does not necessarily mean the entirety of the organisation is absolutely necessary to reach that revenue. It's very non-linear - like may need to square up the number of bodies to merely double the revenue.<br>

And you know "Russia is not about to attack 'Europe'" in the future how exactly? By looking in a crystal ball and seeing the future, or whispering straight into Putin's head, thus altering the future?<br>
Ukraine - Russia's aim is to control it fully, by any means and including war conquest. We know b/c Russians from Putin and all the way down are telling us, often in English for our convenience. Still we are so thick and challenged in the comprehension department that they have to repeat the message for years on end.<br>
Europe plans - latest in the series is Carlson's Dugin interview, again given for our convenience.<br>
TBF we're quite on brand presuming there exists some magical easy solution, that previously escaped both Chamberlain and Churchill - no less! Further - the above is a good example of our infantile narcissism where the universe revolves around us:  Russia had no plans or designs on their own, noo - we had to do something (CIA nazi coup), and only then they reacted. If not for us, on their own, they'd be happily tending their allotments now. Not.<br>

Anyone can indicate to their hearts content. If you want to find out what the reality is, rather than seek to have your beliefs validated, best to stick to "as mach as primary sources as possible". E.g. see the Foreign Affairs articles that go through that https://twitter.com/ljupc0/status/1786418977129787506 , check kremlin ru Putin speeches translated into English for context, check Tucker Carlson's Putin & Dugin interviews and do listen to what they say. They grant the interviews so they relay their message to us, for our own convenience - that's why they bother with Tucker. Regarding BoJo - my understanding is that one of the several things that needed to happen for a deal, was a demand by Ukr that Nato (so incl UK) put boots on the ground in Ukr. The UK rightly said NO, as UK is in no condition to offer any such thing (and this is the message that BoJo relayed). That people above seem oblivious to "UK boots on the ground" for a deal, and keep touting that deal as a good thing for UK, makes me think they haven't read that much. The idea that there is a magic solution that no one has thought about, and now these geniuses are going to find a solution (that previously escaped both Chamberlain and Churchill - no less!) is for the birds.<br>

Negotiating is fine and not too difficult compared to everything else, getting to a deal is a completely different matter. The option for the Ukrainians to lay down the arms and accept to be part of a Neo-Russian empire, with their governors appointed by Kremlin and everything else that goes with that (russification, extinguishment of the nation etc) - that's always available. They could have done it at any point since Feb-2022 up to and including today.<br>
A lot has been written about negotiations recently see https://foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/talks-could-have-ended-war-ukraine , comments on it https://twitter.com/slantchev/status/1780267015091183934, also additions by witnesses https://twitter.com/dszeligowski/status/1785771531458462188, before that https://foreignaffairs.com/ukraine/obstacles-diplomacy-ukraine etc etc<br>

What are you talking about? They negotiated and did not agree. Russia demanded (then and now) a total control over Ukraine. The West did not offer any meaningful guarantees to Ukraine (that it asked for). So it was a no deal. There have been recently couple of articles and threads incl by some of the participants that explained those negotiations well. Laying down the arms and submitting to being controlled by Russia is available at any time.<br>

The thing is, I put my arguments forward why ID cards are a bad idea for the UK, right now. So at no point did I advocate for all places at all times. Please sharpen your reading comprehension. You were rude enough to quite tweet me instead of replying directly. Had you done the latter, maybe you would have better noticed the context.<br>

I trust their propaganda when they are preparing their population for war. Even a dictator can't simply do it without PR persuasion. I think better take them at their word when they tell you what they will do. That's been a winner in predicting the future events so far.<br>

B/c it's cheaper in money and blood (ours) for Ukrainians to fight them in Ukraine than it is for Nato incl UK to fight them in Warsaw then Berlin. We are not helping the Ukrainians b/c we have a soft spot for them in our hearts. Russia will negotiate only the conditions of their total surrender. The option you pine for (understandably) is not available.<br>

That claim would be more credible if you actually pinpoint faults in my arguments. Play the game and not the player etc. I have had and used compulsory ID card for the first 30 years of my life. And then for the next 25 years, I lived fine without one. I know well enough, thank you very much.<br>

That maybe true, but it works good enough and costs not much. Compared to the closest neighbors France and Ireland, I see not one problem that UK has got, that France/Ireland have solved, by having compulsory ID cards. There is no particular reason for UK to put effort in ID cards. Let's keep the perspective - the only reason we are talking about ID cards is that CON-s assumed that can do some voter suppression US-style, so they sneaked voter ID. As with everything else CON-s did: solved no existing problems (there was not great deal vote fraud), but introduced half a dozen new problems that we did not have before.<br>

Good for you! UK has not got any problems due to lack of ID cards. Compared to the closest neighbours like France and Ireland, there is no problem that UK has that France/Ireland have solved by having compulsory ID cards. Let's keep it that way - Estonia ID cards, UK no-ID cards. Live and let live. No reason for UK to put effort in them, when no problem exists, that would be solved by them, that would justify the effort in time and money. Seems perfectly reasonable and fair to me.<br>

Yes to scrapping voter ID. No to ID cards - that's a bad bad idea, a solution in search of a problem. Does UK have unique problems compared to France, or Ireland (closest neighbors) caused by not having ID cards? No - it does not. Ergo - no need for them.<br>

B/c where I lived it was an offense not have one on the person and not being able to show it on demand I think it was between 12am-5am. It was stuff of terror in my high school-university days: coming home from town after midnight, being stopped by a bored policeman, forgotten the ID card at home, unable to produce it, taken to the police station, parents being phoned woken up to come bring your ID and collect you home. ID cards are bad idea, a solution in search of a problem.<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
They fundamentally change the dynamic between the public and the state. E.g. when stopped by police - if no-ID cards, than it's police's job and competency to discover my identity (and I can help them, or not); while with-ID cards, I have to prove my identity to them to their satisfaction (and their threshold maybe arbitrarily high).<br>
The dynamic changes from - trusted by default, to not trusted by default. Trusted by default is better b/c it better corresponds to the reality where most of the public are honest and not crooks or criminals. It's a bad idea to treat 100% of the public as untrustworthy, even if 1% maybe so. Much better to deal with he consequences of trusting the untrustworthy 1%. Disclaimer: I lived in the 1st 30 years of my life in a country with obligatory ID cards and had one myself. Fwiw - self-selection bias and all - on balance I prefer the UK no-ID system.<br>

Agreed 100%. TBF on an individual level, given how infinitesimally unlikely it is for any one vote to swing the course of history, I'm indeed being irrational, when I spend time voting. :-) Still we should all vote - as what's irrational at micro-level, is actually very rational at macro-level. Emergent phenomenon so to say. I use this to motivate my kids now young people. And also I guilt them via - "you have not spend a single day on this earth without someone else doing something for you, the water you drink every morning, the food you eat every day, the heat that heats our home, the home itself - all that was provided to you created by random anonymous other people you will never meet. As a citizen - it is your duty to give something back, e.g. your time - so go and vote." :-)<br>

Nah - what you found out is the norm when my side lets me down: they are CON voters, the CON 14 years rule has been bad, they are worse off, they know it. But to say "I was wrong to vote this" would be to admit an error. Most of us don't admit an error of judgement easily. That contradicts with our egos that tell us "I'm a good person, my actions in the world are good". So we fallback to the "they are all the same" position, meaning: "I did not make an error, b/c even if I had not voted CON I'd be in the same bad place now, nothing would change; I'm blameless, I didn't err". And so we salvage our egos intact unbruised when challenged by reality. This is the norm - not an exception.<br>

UK has YellowCard system for reporting all adverse medicine related events, C19 specifically here https://coronavirus-yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk.

True this - incentives are set that way. Excellent 👏👏<br>
This is part of the point of devolution. The British government and in particular its mighty Treasury is good at stopping sins of commission. White elephants do exist but they are rare, since so many projects are aborted moments after conception. As a result, however, sins of omission are common. Devolution means more things will be tried because of decisions made by local politicians. But that will, inevitably, lead to mistakes.<br>

Impossible to quantify plus covariates => equal weight, but you need more factors. Add -<br>
1) UK had macro-illiterate austerity of Dave & George  2010+, US has had Big Fiscal, BBB, IRA.<br>
2) UK is super centralized. If UK treasury (FinMin) says NO to a project, then that's it. And this can happen even after the Parliament voted for it. (with a weak PM lacking clear mandate b/c not won an election)<br>
3) There is not a 2nd big agglomeration with revenue raising authority (yet; maybe ~Manchester~ in the future?) competing with London that can vary policy and try things different.<br>

There is "great deal of ruination in a nation" but it's not infinite and at some point we get to live with the consequences of our errors. We "got it good and hard" - what sufficient majority voted for.<br>
1) First the telegenic but macro-imbecilic dynamic due of Dave & George (with Clegg & Danny lending a helping hand) swindled the nation Re: austerity while feathering their owns' nests. In contrast - US was doing big fiscal.<br>
2) The energy policy Re: renewables/net-zero is similarly innumerate - so we are paying the highest bills ever - and illogical - we pay other people to drill for us but we don't drill ourselves (as if it matters for the climate who drills). In contrast - US has become the biggest oil producer in history ever. Plus the shale gas.<br>
3) The UK treasury has such stranglehold on any big projects - combo of centralization of power and the governments being weak due to morons leading us and or being unelected lacking clear mandate - and is incentivized to say "NO - there is no money left" b/c it's less risky, b/c one can do no wrong by lazying sitting on the hands whereas any action exposes us to risk of failure - that it results in a stasis.<br>
4) Hard Brexit erecting barriers to trade between our biggest market on our doorstep ofc leads to increased frictions (i.e. costs) and reduced volumes than otherwise would the case (in the EEA or SM+CU counterfactuals). Again - noone else to blame but 35-40% of us that voted for it.<br>
5) The planning system designed to put as many obstacles as possible to developments - everyone knows about this, but there is not enough political power to change it any way, nimbys rule is here to stay.<br>

#PMQs @AngelaRayner clearly has no understanding of #leasehold. Of course, new houses should not be sold leasehold, but flats have to have a way of sharing common costs. No lawyer would advise buying freehold flat. Ppl need to understand this.<br>

Boosters start at disadvantage against the doomers in the "build yes/no" battles, b/c the Treasury is too good at their job protecting the public purse, and too many people believe the easy excuse "there is no money left in the purse". It's a lazy-person-sitting-on-his-hands dream come true: do nothing, no one can prove you wrong, you never fail, there are never any problems, life is good. (you maybe promoted too) In contrast, building stuff exposes you to risk as you may fail, in the process many things will go wrong, all manner of discontents will come after your head. Ofc price stability $$$/widget is serious business and few nations go down the drain when a lunatic takes over the public purse and destroys the $$$ value. However - it is possible to keep the $$$/widgets ratio stable by increasing both the numerator *and* the denominator (by building widgets!) - it's just hard and exposes builders to risks. But therein lies growth of the economy - by definition.<br>

Great column - great conclusion:<br>
> English nationalism is absent because there is no need for it.  Nationalism flourishes when people feel thwarted. But what England  wants, England gets. England, usually, prefers a Conservative government  and so Britain, usually, has one. England wanted out of the eu, and Britain did leave.<br>

Like every invader ever before - exit strategy always exists for the aggressor: just leave, go home. Nurenberg is still a good guide - "War is essentially an evil thing. Its consequences are not confined to  the belligerent states alone, but affect the whole world. To initiate a  war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime;  it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war  crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the  whole." - and applies regardless of who's doing the "aggressing".<br>

I wish this came true. A voice in the back of my head reminds me that the current crop of AI - neural networks - came to fruition after 40 years of trying and failing. And the breakthrough in the end was enabled by a completely different technology - GPU-s - unrelated to AI made for gaming. By a random chance by a happenstance, it so happened that Krizhevsky knew how to program GPU-s. First time I learned backpropagation of errors was at Uni, from the PDP notebooks, named "Parallel Distributed Processing" (https://stanford.edu/~jlmcc/papers/PDP/), b/c at that point "Neural Networks" have become a dirty word (during one of the NN AI winters).<br>

Peace is the end aim, but the means of achieving peace are usually not pacifism. Otherwise we'd have had world peace by now. The reason being - to get peace 2 sides need to want it, to get war - only 1 side suffices to want it. Then the other side has no choice - it's a matter of life and death for them. An unfortunate state of the world. Still - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_aggression is the best guide we have. All should stick to it, and esp the most powerful countries (incl US). Earth is already parceled with borders for better or worse, and much blood was spilled for that. Let's use what we have for easy conflict resolution, like so: "the side that crosses into others' side territory is in the wrong".<br>

A variant of, a spin on, Michael Crichton's "Gell-Mann Amnesia Effect". Not for newspapers and mass-media, but related: a person knowledgeable in area X, with great confidence & vigor pontificates in area Y, typically with mixed results (as would be expected). The confidence signal - coming from knowledge in X - manages to raise the the credibility in Y where it should not really, or at least not to the extent it does. Can think of it as "confidence cross-talk or leakage".<br>

The best argument I've heard: b/c they are telling us so repeatedly, from Putin all the way down. The mass propaganda, talking heads on daily TV, etc are already preparing the population. It's mentioned at some point in this excellent podcast but I can't find the timecode rn (sorry) https://youtube.com/watch?v=YcVSgYz5SJ8&t=2856s . Ofc it's impossible to foresee the future - but it's not unheard for the leaders to telegraph their intentions (e.g. Stalin, Hitler). Putin pursuing Russia "Continental empire" strategy (more land==better) also makes it rational for them. Even if it looks stupid to us.<br>

Bulgarians and everyone else too did not start existing the second the atoms were formed in the universe. At some point in time - there were no Bulgarians. Some time latter - there were Bulgarians. At some point between the two time points a group identity came into being. So did everyone else's group identity - at some point in time! How's that an argument for anything - I shall never know. Macedonians laugh when you tell them b/c it's the best to do in a bad situation. I've experienced it personally. A colleague (well meaning but obv clueless) asked me to count 1..10 "in your language", asked a Bulgarian colleague count 1..10 too, then concluded "ergo - you're the same". He is Canadian. I could have asked him "now you count 1..10 in your language", then his English colleagues, then his American colleagues, to conclude "... you are the same" - but I did not. Better just shrug it off.

In YU we had self-management enterprises (SME) in the 1980s, all companies were run-owned like that. That was a failure. It's a -1 data point, but tbh it  disqualifies SME less than one might think as many other things were a fail there and then. Unemployment was endemic. SME-s had economic incentive to *not* hire new workers. Orders from "the top" (CP) had to be issued to force them to hire additional workers. The SME-s resisted as much as they could. Remember seeing a quote or an abstract of a paper discussing economic incentives  of SME-s that led to be opposed to additional hiring.<br>

Still https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_aggression is the best guide we have. All should stick to it, and esp the most powerful countries, incl US. Earth is already parceled with borders for better or worse. Let's use them for easy conflict resolution == "the side that crosses into others' side territory is in the wrong".<br>

Changing ones opinion when facts change is fine and good. Denying facts, sticking to ones pet theory, flatly ignoring or denying inconvenient evidence (even when it comes from the horses' mouth) that challenges my theory - is not. That's a deal breaker.<br>

... in the limit, given enough time, and unchanging world. The world changes all the time => prices chase the new optimum. Every change makes them appear out of whack tad more. As the price becomes known only after a trade happens, trading business (speculation) exists b/c at any given time the prices are less then optimal. (but moving towards their optimal selves, and pushed by traders)<br>

Introducing new currency is understandably scary for all. I lived through introduction of new currency in a new state (MK) born out of a dissolution of an old one (YU), amidst great uncertainty and turmoil (wars around etc). Technically it's not much, done over an extended weekend Fri-Mon if I remember correctly. The meaning is much more significant and lasting - bonds and relations and relationships broken, severed, never to be established again or at least not for a long time. Not something anyone reasonable looks forward to or hopes for tbh. "May you live in interesting times" is rightly a curse.<br>

It's not American FP disaster. That was Iraq. UKR is RUS policy disaster. Not everything is in US hands. RU has mind of its own. Peace needs 2 sides for it, for war - only 1 side suffices unfortunately. US+EU have been hoping RU has not chosen war of conquest as state policy, against all evidence 2010+ suggesting they have. I get it why `given the choice between war & dishonour we chose dishonour' - but we will get war regardless. It's out of US-EU-UK hands. Once UKR is conquered & puppet gov installed, UKRs will be conscripted to fight a push towards the Baltics and then Poland. Best think what can be done to short circuit or alter that trajectory. We are in a moment like this one -<br>

What an incredible statement - implying that this is somehow a matter of belief. There is nothing to believe or not believe: a fiat currency is created by fiat, by law. These laws us people can read&understand b/c we made them. They are human laws. Stop creating mystery where there is none. There are other things much harder things to ponder&wonder about. Fiat currency is the least interesting & most obvious. Only with much (mis?)education one can lapse into stupidity like yours & create a mountain out of a molehill.

There is no way for anyone to forecast that much future with any degree of certainty. I find such people to be on the narcissistic side. They have difficulty imagining a world separate from themselves. Like babies that think they are one with the world and the world goes all dark when they close their eyes. Or less politely - they have their heads so much up their own arses that they lack any perspective. We are adapted to put more weight on bad than on good things. So catastrophising brings enough social gain, and being wrong brings almost zero penalty, that it's a no brainier win for anyone that does it. At least now with the Internet and social media, there is a record of anyone putting (date,number)-s out in the public space. So when the number fails to materialise on the date, we can remind our Savonarolas. Small wins but better than nothing. Timely too - with the narcissistic mememe-boomer gen starting to internalise their own mortality and confusing their own impending slip into nothingness with the end of the world.<br>

I know they are in profit, b/c companies that do not make a profit make a loss, and then they go bust or shut down. So the question becomes: how much profit. I agree the price maybe too high, and the profit maybe too much. But to cite manufacturing price as evidence for that is weak argument.<br>

Thanks - that's my point: Class-3 NIC of ~£900 p.a. are fixed, *independent* of any income, they are not a %percentage. Everyone contributes the same £900 p.a, and everyone gets the same benefit back. In Europe I'd typically have to pay ~x7-x10 that amount into the pension - the payment is a %percentage of my salary. The sums are order of magnitude higher is my impression: ~15%-25% of the gross salary going into pension contributions. The full UK equivalent wd be NI+FinalSalary (now sadly no longer with us) or NI+SIPP or NI+SalarySacrifice. Those are comparable sums paid in and drawn out.<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
Somewhat misleading. In UK all pay about the same amount (National Insurance), then draw the same pension. In many European countries, pension contributions are percentage% of the salary, and not an insignificant %age too. Certainly significantly higher than the NI in the UK.<br>

This is misleading. The manufacturing cost maybe small - great. But the cost recovered is 1) the cost of R&D from zero to positive result and approval 2) the cost of the same for the other 10 drugs that were similarly developed at huge effort and expense - but failed the tests.<br>

One can reasonably ask, why do we need gas then? Let's shut them down. But ofc we can't do it b/c the problem of storage is not solved (yet). So we rely on gas turbines to supply us when the wind does not blow & the sun does not shine. The battery prices are coming down, hopefully they replicate the success of the solar learning curve, but: it will be many years. I have rooftop solar+battery at home. It does reduce the electricity bill by ~45% for me, and it's been a great learning experience. But also makes me aware of how big a problem storage is going to be.<br>

Sometimes I needle some of them with - "econ phd academia midwits doomer decels". 😆 Bit harsh, but to the civilians like me usually their message comes over as "Taxman raids pubs' cash registers after closing time at midnight to get the gold coins needed to pay police & nurses tomorrow".<br>
Atm "there is no $$$" is used to cover with a patina of respectability laziness, lack of ambition, NoCanDo-attitude . Easier to sit on the hands or chin-stroke & do nothing then work & build. Excuses "why not" are plentiful and come easily. At a country level, the whole country e.g. UK enters a stasis.<br>
Example from today - https://twitter.com/PranMan/status/1774251583754146072 . So India 2024 can, UK in 1900s could, but UK 2024 can't??<br>
Obv UK can do it in 2024 too. But smooth brains spreadsheet bin counters at @hmtreasury went from bad"we cannot afford anything" to worse "we cannot build anything". Cue HS2 cancellation. "Good servant but bad master" comes to mind. There's a reason why FinMin should *not* run the country but serve the country.<br>

Don't follow how you go from "real constraint" (agreed) to "becomes a funding problem". A funding problem would be literally lack of $$$ so a transaction stuff-for-$$$ can not happen even if stuff is available. (UK real example - food banks)<br>
Further, I accuse the "there is no $$$" camp as using it as cover for laziness, lack of ambition and giving NoCanDo attitude a patina of respectability. It's always easier to sit on the hands and do nothing (esp if your life is agreeable enough). For something to happen there is usually a narrow path of possibility, 10 things need to align right. Each one can be excused and reasons "why not" found, making the chance 1 in 2^10 ~ 1 in 1000. Done at a country level - the whole country enters a stasis (e.g. UK) - nothing can be done. Doomer decels rule the roost. No one remembers to ask: well how did our predecessors build all the infrastructure? Were they richer or more numerous or had better machines?<br>

The idea that the basket composition is changed to exclude stuff that matter a lot to most people - housing, transport, energy - and then the name was kept is silly bordering on deception.

That abstraction introduces a constraint that does not exists in the real thing. It becomes possible to say "well, if tax is not collected before hand, it is physically impossible for the gov to spend". It's doubly bad as it also masks the real constraint (real resources). That misdirection then replaces a discussion on what/when/how/why Re: building stuff, with discussion of when/how/why to get the $$$. It would be comical if it was not tragic. In the stuff-for-$$$ exchanges that make the economies, producing the stuff is 1e9 times more difficult than producing the $$$. Further - $$$ production is more law, politics, accounting,  IT even - than is economics (at best - political economics).<br>

Agreed. Scale (billions of us living together as opposed say a band of 20-30) is unnatural in a sense - we have not had time to evolve instruments for this. Our biology is not adapted to this fast and recent change. So we adapt via our cultures that are much faster to change.<br>

There is nothing to reconcile. Our intuition is wrong (communism is *not* a good way to organise billions of people). The wrong idea persists the same way other irrational beliefs persist: we just carry over an idea to a different context without much thinking and b/c it's often the only idea we have frankly. So the 1st thing that comes to mind is also the only thing there is in our mind. I read similarly in economics (possibly on @bryan_caplan<br>
's blog) students start as intuitive protections anti free traders, and have to be taught explicitly about the gains from free trade. Same I believe abt the lump of labour fallacy too. Intuitions we grow up with are simply wrong in the context we are (mis)applying them.<br>

Every other system for organising large groups of people (with far less trust than a family) to live together and cooperate&compete productively has to be explicitly taught.<br>

Amazing how similar late neoliberalism feels like late socialism. Everything getting ever more expensive and worse, seemingly unstoppable en-shittification - housing (building, leasehold), utilities (water, energy), industry (Boeing), etc. Only bright spot IT-technology-AI TBH.<br>

Is parenting a separate activity class? Kids grow up, develop, learn etc on their own. Didn't do anything special than include them in what we did together already. Yes tailor activities to some extent - as with any other member. But didn't feel I was doing exclusive parenting.<br>

Not the best of takes tbh. An uncharitable reading "I was a property of the state and or my parents, and now I've been stolen". Better reading: EEs *exercising their own agency* (oft disregarded by WEs) decided to change teams & break off an abusive relationship with the state they were born unto.<br>

The resiliency is explained by "the price level has not come down". Far from amazing - it's to be expected. Our memories are longer than the 12M rolling window. People's inflation is (correctly) ~30%, unless they got a pay rise of ~30% too in the 2020+ period (and their own personal consumption basket matches the statistical office basket). This is even before getting into  discussions how good RPI-CPI-etc-measures that include yes/no housing, transport (petrol) etc<br>

+1. It's even worse - always tempting to say "we can't afford that" when we are just lazy to do it. Not one among us is never lazy (or worse). So "can't afford" gives patina of respectability to us to indulge. Wish laziness was a mortal sin - but sloth is close enough imo. ;-)<br>

Fwiw I probably got the idea listening to @drmichaellevin on morpho genesis and how cells cooperate & compete to create tissues and organs. Got reminded today again while listening to https://youtube.com/watch?v=AI8M6ikI9wI where homeostasis got mentioned. So a target is set but the path to it is flexible and can't be known in advance (as the starting point as well as the disturbances on the road are unknowable in advance). Weight and obesity from personal observation strike me as a case of homeostatic behavior too. We maybe more successful if we find a way to modify that homeostatic set point (rather than as we presently do - micro-managing and trying to alter the path our weight takes).<br>

Do they have the equivalent of forfeiture? In the UK, if the LH-older owes a debt of £350 to the FH-older, the property that maybe worth say £350K can be taken away (confiscated) from the LH-older and returned to the FH-older *without any further compensation*! So one effectively loses the home one owns on a whim! Sounds like "nah, this can't be true", but actually happens regularly, last I read was "about 80 such cases a year". If this is not private property theft (albeit from a peasant to his feudal lord), IDK what property theft is. Appendages from feudalism in the otherwise uber-capitalist UK.<br>

Qs: is it me, am I unlucky...) Seems doomer decel "no can do" thinking is HQ-ed in @hmtreasury, started as "we cannot afford anything", nowdays morphed to "we cannot build anything" (e.g. c.f. https://newyorker.com/magazine/2024/04/01/what-have-fourteen-years-of-conservative-rule-done-to-britain). That thinking is not an exception but fully aligned with large swathes of the population cutting across class, economic and educational status, geography etc. Can't discern the root cause - it's not young/old, not rich/poor, not boomer yes/no and so on. So far the best I came up with is reasonable(clever?)/silly(stupid) and or JustDoIt/lazy, but that's unsatisfactory, too ill defined. I'm stumped.<br>

I've found it useful when talking to libertarians to acknowledge: I wish property rights were natural! Then we'd have one less obstacle in building prosperity. Like if they were like the law of gravity - working on their own with no input from us. Alas - that is not the case. A dozen neighbors can gang together and disposes me of my property and life. If property laws were laws of nature - they'd protect the prey from the tiger. As it is - property rights are created by all of us and for a good reason: they make our societies prosperous, and we all live better lives that way. However - let's not kid ourselves there is anything natural about them. They are un-natural, created by us, for a good reason, and they can easily crumble and stop existing.<br>

Maybe. On the other hand, it's the easiest fob off for the Chancellor of the Exchequer: "can't do, no £££ left". Oft simply means "don't want to spend £££ on it (will spend elsewhere)". It's good to compare to some baseline. Maybe one from prior UK history: did UK educate more nurses in 1950? Or in 1970? In absolute counts or some relative per capita measure? Was UK richer or poorer than? So to be able to put various claims in some context, to be able to reason about them.<br>

IDK, you'd have to express the above in maths symbols I'm afraid. In my mind, say p(x,y) is the p.d.f. capturing quantifying all that is known about the (x,y) relationship. Entropy == amount of our ignorance (the opposite of knowledge) == the amount of flatness (the opposite of spikeness) of the pdf p(x,y). A new data point coming in and us updating p(x,y) to incorporate the new observation, may increase or decrease the entropy measure, so new information may increase or decrease our knowledge, e.g. c.f. "How to  measure the information gained from one symbol" https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0954-898X/10/4/303 . And expand from there.<br>

Nah. She was right to point the stupendous amounts of $$$ and effort and time (public and private) it takes to R&D. The public should rather be educated with "9 in 10 projects we finance will fail - that's expected - and if they do not, we are not taking enough risk", than deluded with "the state spends $$$ on projects that succeed 100% of the time and we are responsible custodians of the public purse".<br>

Spot on! Yeah - it's a huge conundrum. The largest group of people where we agree voluntarily to cooperate and take a personal hit (e.g. taxes) for the good of others is the nation. Further 0 that aligns with democracy as is practiced atm: the rule of 51% that the 49% accept voluntarily. However, EU is an union of states, not of citizens. It's not possible to have EU of citizens, b/c there is not an EU nation (the way there is a US nation - American). There can not be EU demo-cracy, as there is not European demos. Currently largest demos==nation. One can drill down to the why-s and how-s further etc - but the above observations are the start.<br>

Excellent question! Logically I'd expect either 1) the energy producing capacity is impaired i.e. insufficient; and or 2) the signalling that should prompt that production is faulty not managing to deliver the information. Either way fat people lack energy => signaling "must eat now" happens, but then the extra food is not converted into extra energy needed. Instead the extra food is converted into energy store - fat. So the signal "must eat/need energy" never stops. Possibly the decision lever how much food to convert into blood sugar and other shorter term energy stores v.s. longer term energy store (fat) is faulty, always errs on the side "store into long term storage (fat)". Possible that the fat storage tissues almost act in some way like cancers do: appropriate too much resource to itselves, at the expense of the entire body.<br>

I'm no proponent but it's trivially easy to see that their description of the fiat currency system is true to the present reality. Other notice that too - libertarians, BoE whitepaper "Money Creation in the Modern Economy", Greenspan, cryptos etc. Economists are uniquely ill prepared for anything to do with money though: their discipline is about producing real stuff we all consume or use, which is many orders of magnitudes harder. By comparison the tokens or spreadsheet cells used to facilitate exchange of said stuff are trivial in almost every aspect. Banking is 1st and foremost law, then accounting, then IT and at distant 4th only related to economics.<br>

Kids are the best thing that happened to me, ever. Had I known how much joy and fun they are growing - would have made more effort to have kids earlier&more. Watching a child grow up from nothing to a human day in/out is one of the most awe inspiring sights. Nothing else in nature comes close tbh! The vastness of the night sky with the stars twinkling or a powerful waterfall maybe impressive, AI may amaze us - but: they look small when compared to e.g. a child learning language and starting to talk and converse! Out of seemingly nothing! Whatever self-organization self-learning or developmental programs unfold - they are an awesome sight to behold at every stage. (not a new parent, not a mother)<br>

Unlike Google search who seems to stay forever dumb and oblivious to the real me, even after giving them full access to my digital life (which is good portion of my life nowdays) through tracking my Gmail, location, photos, internet searches etc etc. Google is just staggeringly incompetent at being the Stazi.

Would have been pragmatic if immoral if appeasement bought peace or security. But as things stand (RUS mobilizing +500K army by summer, its economy on war footing for 2yrs already) and considering the context (RUS "offense is our defense") - it will bring neither, so it's not pragmatic even on its own terms? How stupid is this??? This is signalling to Putin "take UKR". Putin will receive a message "US is weak" and then make a mistake of attacking the rest of Central and Eastern Europe. Europe is on  the path to WW3 - ffs wars #1 and #2 not enough?? Prudent CEEu/RUS forecasting: assume the worst and top it up with more misery & couple of random f*ckups. Possibly CEEu acquiring nuclear deterrent quickly may give RUS a pause - but no signs of anything like that on either side.<br>

Agreed. I'm just noticing that there's plenty of time for REF to stand down their candidates and 3/4 of their vote will go back CON. Although when surveyed only 1/4 REF say they'll switch REF->CON, I think surveyed are lying (as oft the case on range of things).

Forecasting is hard, and especially of the future - episode 1001. 😱 RUS invaded UKR thinking UKR is weak (but West is strong). In the process, they discovered that UKR is strong(er) than anticipated, but that West is much weak(er)! As is with offense-is-best-defense  types, RUS will press on to exploit this newly found opening to own advantage. It's possible we're in WW3 already - but we don't know it yet.<br>

Tocno taka - i nikoj ne dal podobro resenie. Porano vo socijalizmot do 1990-ta imase mislenje - toa "pazar" e kapitalisticka izmislica, nas ne ni treba, nie sme popametni (i vo vicovite stalno bea "amerikanec, rusin i jugosloven" i posledniov stalno na kraj najpameten ispagase), i jas kako Sekretar na Ce-Ka, ili Pretsedael na I-S, jas sega ke im kazem na zemjodelcite sto da sadat, kade i kolku. Toa propadna ne/slavno, imase "kataklizma komunizma" vo 1990-ta, posle toa iskustvo kao smenivme mislenje.<br>

Opsto - kolku da bide trgovijata slobodna, a kolku neslobodna, e debata (da ne se povtoruvam - pogore https://twitter.com/ljupc0/status/1770136891548893408<br>
). Vo MK (i vo YU) tradicionalno istoriski - poveke imalo nesloboda, i vo sekoja sfera. (moze zatoa vo himnata "sloboda" se spomnuva 3 pati vo 4 stiha, haha 😀 ) Po/sloboodna trgovija kade na pr vo UK hrana uvezuvame od drug kontinent: +vno e sto e po-eftina/kvalitetna, -vno e sto imame zgolemen rizik da ne ja dobieme. Posto dobavuvackiot lanec (supply chain) e podolg koga uvezuvame, pogolem e rizikot da bide prekinat (na pr vojni i sl), i deka hranata nema da stigne i ke ostaneme gladni. Na pr. UK odgleduva grasok doma, ima i uvezuva od Kenija. UK grasok e poskap, ama posigurni sme deka ke go dobieme.

Da moze - togas potrosuvacite, odnosno site vie vo MK (vkl i zemjodelcite), ke morate da platite poskapo za toj grav. Momentalno imate izbor - birate megu poeftin uvozen ili poskap domasen. So ekstra danok i stranskiot ke stane skap kolku domasniot. Istoto primeneto na site proizvodi (posto grav neli ne e nekoj isklucok) - znaci se ke platite poskapo, standardot malku ke vi opadne. Toa imase vo socijalizmot - uvozot bese kontroliran,  ogranicen, odanocen i sl. Vo takvi uslovi nekade uspea da se razvie domasno proizvodstvo (Slovenija), a nekade ne se razvi: ni posle 45 god zastita ne uspeaa domasnite proizvodi da stanat konkurentni na stranskite po cena-kvalitet. Toa e vecna dilema kolkav odnos zastita-konkurencija e optimalen za proizvoditeli-i-potrosuvaci. Ima razlicni mislenja. Od edna krajnost "23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism" pa do drugata "Open: The Story Of Human Progress". Jas mislam - zavisi od lugeto, od organizacijata na tie luge, od zemjata, geografijata, istorijata etc dali i sto ke uspee ili ne. Nikoj ne znae 100% tocno zasto nekoi ekonomski se razvivaat a drugi ne, i kako site da se ekonomski razvivaat.<br>

Yes. This is a write up on a similar trial. Done by the TFL, at one Tube station. Also using the existing cameras only. Overlaying ML image processing on top of existing CCTV.  By @Psythor here https://takes.jamesomalley.co.uk/p/tfls-ai-tube-station-experiment-is .  Looking at the group v.s. individual dynamic, I get the worries about the group crushing the individual. I think we don't apply the concerns to the same level in the opposite direction: the lone rotten apple spoiling the entire barrel. We are all individuals 1st - so our bias is excusable to some extent. Participating in online forums, I appreciate that 1 crazy psycho can destroy a community of 100. Also offline RL workplace dynamics similar examples.<br>

This is both needless (did a lot of people ask for it?) and stupid. It has the potential to create strife and division where there are none atm. Next Christians (or even Atheists? Humanists?) will ask for the same during their Holly days. Then a dispute between religions will erupt about the frequency of the messages, their lengths, the font sizes of it, etc and incl abt the criteria of what constitutes equal treatment... Proportional to believers percentages (but what's a believer?), or equal per religion (but does Jedi qualify as a religion then?). And on and on... - never ending strife that will consume our energies and time for zero gain.<br>

Excellent by @DmitriLevitin laying down the Russia logic of permanent imperial expansion. RU neighbors in CE-Europe must acquire independent nuclear deterrent if they want to survive. Nothing else will suffice. Ultimately US (and FR, UK too) will not risk nuclear war over CEEu, and both RU and US know it. This is CEEu Israel-1967 moment - get working on nuclear deterrent if you want to live. CEEu elites seem to lack imagination to internalize this, even if they on some level understand it to be true. Poland & Baltic countries are in the cross-hairs already. History does not repeat, but equally it never entirely goes away. Poland last lesson on in-effective alliances was 1939. For the Czechs & Slovaks the bear hug of 1968 should be fresh enough. Hungarians seem to have forgotten 1956 in favor of earlier schemes that seem so far-fetched as to be almost silly. If Israel much smaller and poorer in 1967 could do it, so can e.g. Poland and Romania in 2024. More recently North Korea is another example - if there's the will, it can be done.<br>

Short: No money in it anymore. (you said it)<br>
Long: Change of business model.<br>
Current business model is subscription. Subscription favors partisanship & tending to your side - otherwise your your customers (subscribers) will flee, if media fails to give them what they want.<br>
Previous business model was advertising. Advertisers paid for the media, so they wanted as many as possible (ideally all) to see their adverts. That tended to favor seeking the truth as truth is something that a majority can experience it the same, it's the default for the largest group of people.<br>
Minority lunatics that are mostly incapable of perceiving what's true will always exist, and they are always a minority. Minority that advertisers could ignore in the past. Now the minority of lunatics are the ones paying subscription - so the media tends to them.<br>

Failure of imagination, and not of information (that was always plentiful) - exactly! Same pattern when information abt the Holocaust reaches US during WW2 too.

Three factors: 1) Energy - e.g. US biggest oil producer in history ever 2) (Big) Tech Co-s at ATH 3) Big fiscal i.e. Bidenomics. UK could do something abt #1 & #3. But that goes against current UK mainstream ideologies. It's not what you don't know that hurts you - it's what you (think you) know, but that it just ain't so. Until us in the UK abandon ideas we hold "that just ain't so", we will not see growth. Scant evidence of the UK chattering classes doing any of that atm tbh.<br>

The connectionist models are the best models we have to explore the inner workings of our brains. Planes have wings but they don't flap them like the birds do.

Why? B/c they are 1) lazy 2) stupid. We have to start with low opinion of Europe given they uniquely in world history fought 2 World Wars (one could have been an accident - but not two) between themselves and in the process destroyed themselves. But not all are still buying - some are doing better than others. CEeuropeans know you can't reason with a bear when your head is in its jaws. Some like Austrians and Hungarians are bent on repeating that lesson it seems. TBS what transpires - UKR gas transit contract expires in 2024, and UKR drones may yet succeed disrupting oil exports. Agreed - insane to have Europe through RUS fossil fuels purchase finance the war machine that is set on bombarding destroying European cities in not too distant future. Maybe europeans should watch russian TV more tbh.<br>

Correct it's not ours - it's Ukraine's. No one is asking us i.e. UK to fight over anything. Ukraine asked for help in weapons, munitions, training and the like. To think that peace will be achieved then is very naive verging on negligent imo. It would be against the experience of the previous ~300 years of history and esp in Eastern Europe. I get it we are not interested in a war - no sane person ever is. However I think Putin’s war is interested in us, unfortunately. I have 2 sons. I hope I'm proven wrong by future events.<br>

They don't think, they just surf the vibes. They are not lying as such, as they are truly postmodern and have no concept of truth and falsehood. When reality interferes, they think of another magical story, go around the said reality, and continue. For as long as enough rubes believe them and vote them in, they continue.<br>

Supplying weapons to one side in a conflict is not entertaining a war. While there are no British soldiers on the ground, and even with small numbers of technicians or trainers - we are not at war. I have two boys myself and am 1000% interested in avoiding another European war. Whatever was done or not done (and mostly not done) since 2010+ obv led to ever increasing escalation thus far. Europe is probably still buying RU fossil fuels to the tune of 100s of billions, financing the war machine that is about to attack it. Insane.<br>

Ofc not. Ofc it will come to a peace deal at some point. UKR as fighting for - what kind of peace deal. Peace deal can mean from one extreme UKR surrendering today RUS taking over installing a puppet gov, to the other extreme RUS withdrawing to the 2020 or even 2014 borders. Both and including all options between those two extremes are a "peace deal". UKR are fighting for what kind of peace deal they will manage to win out in the end.<br>

Putin demanded almost unconditional surrender and obv Ukraine did not agree to that in the end. Sure, the war can end today if UKR accepted RUS aims as per the map below. RU demanded UA disarm and "US and UK guarantee" something or other. BoJo flew to say "UK will not guarantee anything as it's in no position to do so, but will help UA with arms" (sensibly, imo). After that fail in negotiations, RU sensibly put out the usual story "us good, west bad" and spun up ~20 false narratives so the 20% of the population that are NPC have something to latch on and amplify. SMO and almost always works well enough.<br>

Current RUS aims in UKR are presented by Medvedev below on a map. Russia aims in EEu have been expansion west for >200 years now. They clashed with their competitor empires, Austro-Hungarian & Ottoman. In the process the latter disintegrated. A dozen new nation states sprang in CEEu. No idea why you think you know better what RU wants then themselves know and are telling us?? 1-Sep-1939 too was part of a similar push into CEEu.<br>

They negotiated and did not come to an agreement. Russia war aims are the same today as they were 2 years ago, they repeat them daily, b/c we seem to be too thick & slow on the uptake. What you believe is irrelevant. The war could end today if UKR accepts the terms below:<br>
Medvedev presenting a map depicting Russia war aims in Ukraine: most of Ukraine taken over by Russia and landlocked rump around Kyev left only. Russia longer term aim is dissolution of the Ukraine state and destruction of Ukrainian nationhood including the language and culture.<br>

Lost any respect with him flatly denying what the RU side is openly saying. One can have ideas how the world should work or how it works - but: when the RU side from Putin down tells it "UA is ours, we''ll take it, and extinguish UA nationhood" - well then, better take that onboard & stop further speculation.

We are not as important to RU as we think we are. Whether we do or not do some or the other does not have as much influence as we think it has. RU does as they see fit. Putin can see a state of war helps him domestically - 1) kills off any remaining opposition, 2) he becomes more popular with the population, 3) a war economy further strenghtens his control over the economy. Instead of talking to ourselves it would help us to listen what is said in RU daily. E.g. from today -<br>

Exactly this. I thought that government collects coins from butchers and tailors via tax, and then spends those same coins to pay the policeman and the teachers. No tax no coins => police and schools don't get their wages. Imo 99% of us lay public thinks like that, to the extent we think anything at all about finance and gov spending. This is what MSM usually tells us too tbh. I have the impression that central bankers, prime and finance ministers, and dare I say economists, are well aware how this is misunderstood by the public. But it makes their jobs easier (in a somewhat Straussian "you can't handle the truth" way) so they don't try too hard to correct it. Easiest deflection that FinMin can do is to say "there is no money left" when s/he is barraged by demands on the public purse from all directions.<br>

Both. There are constraints on what building qualifies for RTM (%age of LH versus say commercial premises), and then if it's not disallowed on that test, then there is further %age of LH that have to sign up for it test. Then there will be a drawn out process where the existing MA in collusion with FH will try to frustrate and slow down the process, while trying to squeeze max possible from LH while they still can. At handover MA will go dark and unresponsive and handover nothing to RTM. All within the law - as in, they will suffer no ill consequences. It has to be seen to be believed. I recommend joining any online group where RTM is discussed<br>

Hi - yes. All my life I've heard forever "gov collects taxes & that way pays for public services, if budget deficit => then must cut public spending to balance to zero". This is the level of the current understanding of gov finances for most of us civilians tbh. @wbmosler Was the 1st I heard say "it's not like that, it's not like gov needs to collect coins via tax and then distribute those coins to the soldiers and teachers", @StephanieKelton was the 1st I hear say "inflation is the limit, deficit is important only insofar fuels inflation otherwise not". Not an economist, just a layperson forced to care about finance (and economics a bit) by circumstance.<br>

You are preaching to the converted. :-) Thanks - yes, RTM is one big step towards taking back control of our lives.

Legislating RTM by default would be an obvious gov win - but will have to wait on a government less captured by vested interests and party finance.<br>

In theory, theory and practice are the same. In practice, theory and practice differ. The MA joined at the hip with the FH don't have to do anything they "should be doing", and LH can't do anything much about it. Never heard of any MA or FH suffer any sanctions or hardship ever, no matter how much they don't do what "they should be doing". Have heard plenty of words - that's for sure. Action is non-existent.

Just stay away from Leasehold if you possibly can. You have unlimited liability. You have almost zero control. Someone else is writing the bills, you must pay them. If you don't, the property is taken away from you with 0 compensation to you. You will be ruined. The law is heavily stacked against you. You will be pitted against career semi-criminals and you will lose - twice over. Even if you win in court - there is no redress for you. The criminal will make you pay for their cost + extract money from you to pay for any redress. People don't know this, it's never properly explained to them. Even when explained, they can't believe it. ("I 'm not saying you are lying to me - but I still can't believe what you just told me")<br>
Stay away from Leasehold - it will ruin you.<br>

Example: I get my input data from a central sql database outside of my control. That data will change even if in theory it should not. But in practice it does, for any number of reasons. As that is an input to the rest of the pipeline - if one byte there changes, by the end, the results of my research will differ between runs. Even if I did not change anything in my side.. To control for data changing underneath me, whatever is fetched from a database, it can be saved/cached locally (even as a binary like python pickle, matlab mat - trivially easy). So I'm 100% sure I can rerun identical code on identical input data. Agreed stale data can cause problems - not advocating for stale data. :-) I am saying a researcher has to be able to control the input data (detect change, rollback to prior version etc) if the research is to be reproducible.<br>

House prices can rise for other reasons than supply-demand: mortgage availability e.g. relaxing the old 3:1 price:income limit, cost of mortgage (interest rates) and so on. Relaxing the income limit probably is x5-x7 times stronger than any other factor, but hey 🤷‍♂️<br>

Cache at multiple levels so to gain 1) speed but much more importantly 2) reproducibility! Any science is predicated on reproducibility. Ideally a DAG would encode dependencies between the caches (maybe hierarchical) and auto-recompute, but "don't over-engineer" is good so usually it's a mix of manual and automatic that strikes a good balance.<br>

One explanation I read today that seems to me to be at least partly true is: (Ellul) "He who acts in obedience to propaganda can never go back. He is now obliged to believe in that propaganda because of his past action. He is obliged to receive from it his justification and authority, without which his action will seem to him absurd or unjust, which would be intolerable."<br>

Present sciences didn't exist until recently. What was there that had any even if distant connection with any thinking was philosophy in the widest sense. In that sense parts that were successful showed any progress i.e. "worked out" developed into their own sciences.<br>

Indeed the connectionist models like that one are the best models we have of the human brain. Good to remember when we object "ah, but they are not like us". They were inspired by, and designed to mimic features neuroscientists (like @geoffreyhinton) figured are present in human (and animal) brains. The beginnings trace back to 1943 - so to the very start of computing era. For all this time the objections of their detractors were not that they don't model aspects of human cognition, but that they were not effective, that did not work well enough to get things done. Well - that hurdle has been passed now. We are living in interesting times. 😊<br>

There are no "understandable reasons". "To initiate a war of aggression, therefore, is not only an international crime; it is the supreme international crime differing only from other war crimes in that it contains within itself the accumulated evil of the whole". That's true whether US does it or Russia does it or anyone else. Who or why does it does does not change the immorality of it. Two world wars in Europe should have been educational enough for everyone - but apparently that's not the case.<br>

Looks like US avoided stagnation (at least the type UK is stuck with) post GFC'08 - no? Thinking of differences in things not/done US vs UK 1) tech industry - UK can't do much there 2) Energy, fracking - UK doesn't do b/c of ideology 3) The Big Fiscal - UK is ideologically opposed to it. So 2/3 are self inflicted b/c of things UK thinks are true, but "they just ain't so". Not much can be done until UK abandons ideas it thinks are true, but reality falsifies them.<br>

Halve the distance and you will reduce the error in your thinking. The one notable difference US vs. UK is "the Big Fiscal" (c.f. https://postneoliberalism.org/articles/whatever-it-takes-how-neoliberalism-hijacked-the-public-purse/ by @ptcherneva), and imo that explains the large difference in outcomes - US growing, UK stagnating. UK woes predate Brexit and even the GFC'08, are enumerated in https://thecritic.co.uk/stop-blaming-brexit-for-britains-economic-ills/ by @DerrickBerthel1 . I acknowledge it's axiomatic that "it's impossible to see that an idea I think is true is actually wrong and this is the reason for my troubles", but if it makes you feel better, it's a generational boomer fail, only little to do with yourself personally.<br>

I'd find fault with the "only" in "only about the precedence of words", similar to "only autocompletes the next word". It's the *high quality* of that precedence (or autocomplete) than makes us think  "they have intelligence/empathy". We've had machines that did autocomplete at low quality for decades - and no one thought of them intelligent nor emphatic.<br>

It's generational. Boomers had the right ideas to start with, but in the last ~15 yrs boomers have been mostly wrong. "It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so". To fix - look at comparable economy (US) that did not stagnate, note what difference in ideas that made for difference in outcomes - https://postneoliberalism.org/articles/whatever-it-takes-how-neoliberalism-hijacked-the-public-purse/ by @ptcherneva . These ideas are anathema to your generation - doubt boomers can change in olden age.

IDK - for me it seemed the N=0 argument has weight. Would I take a bet that at N=0 the chance of the event happening is 1/(0+2)=50% ? Probably not, but then for some things the start period (influencing N) is more obvious than for others.<br>

Note to self: always do both, it's a minor add to tuck in empathy too. Solution(ism) without commiseration backfires depressingly oft enough in the worst possible way: in addition to foregoing a likely helpful solution, a conflict is started where previously there was none! 😬😱<br>

"It ain't what you don't know that gets you into trouble. It's what you know for sure that just ain't so." Excellent rundown of woes facing UK with their respective timelines & baselines. @DerrickBerthel1 👏👏 Each one can be traced back to idea(s)/ideology that "just ain't so".<br>

Those unhappy with British economic woes need to stop blaming it all on Brexit — not only is it inaccurate, but writes @DerrickBerthel1, it distracts from real problems<br>

Oft we find it's impossible to move onto the next thing without honesty about what happened in the past esp recent one esp when that past impact the future. Hence truth&reconciliation commissions & like. Not b/c anyone enjoys recalling the painful past, but b/c it's *impossible* to move forward without the truth of the past being told and acknowledged by all.<br>

Always do both jic, it's only a minor add to tuck in empathy in the bag too. But yes -  solution without commiseration often backfires in the worst possible way: not only is fairly sane solution that'd help rejected, but a conflict is started where previously there was none. 😱<br>

More like:<br>
1. Before Brexit EU was an easy distraction that half the country used to avoid the real issues.<br>
2. After Brexit now Brexit is the one distraction that 90% of the country is blinded by and has no attention left for the real issues.<br>
So we have gone from bad to worse.<br>

On the contrary - Scholzing makes a big nuclear war more likely. Nuclear threat + war of conquest = everyone around Russia will rush to develop own nuclear weapons. More weapons in more hands => more likely to be used.<br>

How python became the data processing language is one of life mysteries. Another "worse is better" - but it even lacks arrays ffs! Excel at least has sheets - an universal 2D rectangular grid matrix. The dependency DAG recompute engine is smart to minimize recompute i.e. never re/compute any data more times than required.<br>

All data has missing values. For encoding missing values in data at rest NaNs are indispensable b/c any operation on a NaN results in a NaN. So they spread like a wildfire! :-) That's exactly what we want. Plus one can set a FP exception on NaN. I usually turn that off and check manually as part larger schemes of data sanity checking and assurance.<br>

Sure. In general, I find having special not-of-this-type out-of-band value useful (to the extent to #define INT_NAN INT_MIN): nullptr for *pointers, NaN for floats, 0 for index 1-based arrays, '\0' for chars and so on.<br>

:-) Agree to disagree. NaNs are always handy, in the weights maybe not for storing, but say for operations. Like - want to do a forward pass with a "ignore those weights" mask => just make those weights NaNs and go forward.<br>

Just go forth and develop your own nuclear deterrent, and only afterwards acknowledge "we have it it's done" after the 1st underground nuclear test. The 1939 alliance of the unable (even if willing) didn't work out. Don't wait for a 4th partition/dissolution, you're out of time.<br>

Press for elections sooner rather than later. Change is needed. Looking around - Bidenomics seems to be the only successful economic policy in the current circumstances. Current CONs are ideologically opposed to the New Deal-ish angle of it - they need to go. Boomers run out of prior generations assets to privatise and sweat. New assets need to be built. The sooner the country starts building - the better.<br>

Correct on the nation cohesiveness (nation being "the largest group of people where 49% minority trust the 51% majority enough to accept their rule temporary even when they don't like it"), not quite right on YU or NI. In YU and NI there is not a single nation, these are not nation states - there are multiple nations within the state. That's why simple democracy is not possible too - currently demos==nation, and there is not one demos, but 2 or more. (fwiw UK is also not a single nation state either ...)<br>

My 2p: car manufacturers are not willing to undergo the change. They don't know what they don't know. 🙄 Such colossal culture change can only come from the top - and their CEO-s are clueless. Even when they recognise what they need to create (e.g. a Tesla competitor) - they can't do it, are not capable of creating it. Nokia could see for years that contrary to their opinions iPhone was hugely successful - and they still were not capable of producing a competitor.<br>

Legacy car manufacturers have been in the h/w business all their lives. EV is as much software as is hardware. Feels like Apple-Nokia moment. For an old car manufacturer to learn s/w - needs to start with the CEO. Latest episode in the "Software is eating the world" reality show (c.f. @pmarca)<br>

(apology for offering unsolicited opinion - will be the last time I do) Afaik this description of how our fiat system works is correct. I personally find abstracting spreadsheets instead of rings drawn in the video as understandable, but rings are visually way more appealing. ☺️ Shortest summary: Level 1 - Central Bank (BoE) owning and operating a spreadsheet with 1) current/reserve (current, 0 interest) and 2) gilts/bonds (savings, 5.25% interest) accounts for the commercial UK banks (Barclays, Lloyds etc).  Level 2 - Every commercial UK bank owning and operating their own spreadsheet each, with 1) current (0 interest) and 2) saving (>0% interest) for me and yourself, their customers.<br>

That's the field that tries to predict whether some chemical is going to bind to something. And basically he wiped out that field, without knowing its name."<br>

Until there is a euro-nation (the same way e.g. there exists an american nation), euro-anything can't be democratic (so for  very long time, possible forever). It's not even meant to be afaik. It's a union of states, one-state-one-vote, not one-person-one -vote, not one-$$$-one-vote or anything else. Specifically - the existing (nation) states are the basic units i.e. members.<br>

Given that both regression and classification ("train (fit) on full data (X,Y), at test time I will show you present X, your task is to guess missing Y") can be considered to be cases of missing data ("observed present X, did not observe missing Y"), one can sympathize that's it's almost impossible to teach it with any consistency. One has to almost use the latter/advanced part of the course to explain MD (and treatment) at the very start of the course?? Don't envy your task at all.<br>

Sympathize with this, MD handling is usually a horror show. Treated as if a rare edge case, whereas in reality we are confronted immediately at Step 2 (after Step 1: collect data in table). To start with, it'd be an improvement on the current state for the tools used to *acknowledge* the presence of MD, maybe via 1) MD is NaN 2) Use existing floating point feature "NaN pollutes everything it touches" that's in hardware already 3) have NaN-aware functions be the default (nansum(), nanmean() ...) and the non-NaN ones (sum(), mean()) be special cases (not the other way around). Of all the tools I've used, think Matlab-s treatment of MD via NaNs and nan-aware functions to be better than the rest.<br>

🎯 Agree 100%. To me it seemed the last refuge of R&D where it's hard to get ahead by politics alone (in HFs since 2004). With caveats though - at decision time 1) the future is unknown, so which bet (among few proposed) to take is still somewhat a beauty contest (but there is subsequent feedback loop - once time passes and we learn the results the wrong bets die off); and 2) esp at slow trading/long horizons - there is a large element of luck (the shorter the horizon, the faster skill/luck works through/shows up). I am in fully systematic non-discretionary, there any and all work is committed code in the git repository (+ an odd presentation to the research group to explain & persuade the peers). So even more streamlined and in the open. Recommended.<br>

Ok - it makes sense to me then. L-K gov msg to the Treasury was "you do as we tell you". Treasury fought back via BoE rearguard action. That makes sense. L-K gov was crowned w/out popular support. So it was as easily replaced with another one (also without much support). I presume it wd be different with a gov that had won an election and has more & broader backing. BJ gov had that - but BJ was not interested in putting in the work needed to exercise power (and not only write abt it and cosplay "ruling").<br>

Are BoE and the Treasury joined at the hip per chance? Is there maybe a 2-way traffic between them? At the time it looked like Truss-Kwarteng radicals are at war with the Treasury. Did T-K also step on the BoE turf - so BoE hit back? It's a mystery to me too, am curious to find out what happened.<br>

The worry exists regardless. Politicians are changed in elections these days routinely - so "polits holding citizen hostage" is a peculiar take. Polits will make hay (and esp in elections) from the latest by Karakachanov, but it's the news portals & papers that splash it on the front pages (not polits). Fear sells - and macedonians are fearful when they see pictures of BG MPs holding a placard with a map of BG extending over MK. Yes - it's unrepresentative, it's a extreme view of a minority (one hopes; and minorities exists with extreme views on various issue everywhere) - but that does make the worries go away.<br>

If really lacking pounds - it means they have been destroyed by the state (it's their sole destroyer and creator). But don't think it's the pounds we in the UK lack - it's the goods and services that those pounds should buy that are not created. Many reasons (all discussed online at length), but the most basic one - no-can-do culture being the default by a generation of nimby boomers that got lucky and want things to stay exactly as they are. Especially now they are faced with their own mortality. Once aging starts and things start going downhill, every day not worse than the previous is a good one. One wants things to stay the same - ideally to stop the passing of time.<br>

The fact that someone on the MK side wants to win points (for elections or otherwise) does not make the impression that the rhetoric mentioned leaves on the ordinary citizens any less real. Ministers in BG gov, MPs etc have been quoted in the past. Ofc people get worried.<br>

To macedonians when in Bulgaria someone says "there is no macedonia/n/nation/language, it's all bulgaria/n/s" that sounds very much like when Putin says "there are no ukraine/ians/language, it's all russia/n/s". Telling it how it comes over to the other side is not propaganda.<br>

It's not anti-russian to say "ukrainians are their own nation with own language". Likewise for the macedonians - it's not anti-bulgarian to push back against bulgarian narrative of "there is no macedonian nation, there's no macedonian language".<br>

One consequence: because RU does stunts like this themselves, then they assume the other side does similar too. (kill the own for lame PR-blame) Makes no sense - until one realizes they value their own even less than the enemy. The own is already "owned", so it's valueless, whereas the other side is not yet owned. (that's what the fight is about - to "own" the UA side)<br>

The reasonableness is determined in court (FTT?). That in itself is deterrent to any LH challenge. Even if LH is found in the right, there are no legal instruments to enforce it such that FH/MA obeys the ruling. It's a fig leaf of plausible legal recourse that in practice means little. Horror stories are a legion - it's not the case of few bad FH/MA apples. Until LH can hire/fire MA-s, and while FH has the forfeiture Damocles sword hanging over LH, nothing will change, b/c - incentives.<br>

The "no constrains on" is more consequential then most realize. Perfectly legal for 1) FH-older to send a bill of 10K, 100K, ... to the LH-older 2) LH fails to pay 3) LH forfeited the lease / FH gets possession of the flat 4) LH is left liable for the mortgage on the flat.<br>

Radical transparency FTW: make all UK gov business (central gov, civil service, local gov ...) public on the web by default. Reverse the current assumption of "secret by default", only partially opened to citizens scrutiny on request & piecemeal via the FOI process. Yes ministers, civil servants, CEO-s etc will try to get smart and 1. obfuscate (wink nod, double speak) and 2. hide ("self-destructing" messages, phones deleted) but these are 1. easier problems than the blanket secrecy and 2. can be addressed in turns.

I use IDE-s - CLion, Spyder, Matlab - for debugging, help and similar, and in parallel use vim + ctags + Makefile (+ cmd line tools - awk, rsync, rcopy, ...). It works mostly fine without tears. As long as the IDE can pickup automatically that the file changed externally and not have a nervous breakdown. Esp after initial setup figuring what and where the files and the dirs are.<br>

When society wants more of something, usually it tries to remove the obstacles preventing it. First - how about asking less in effort and perfection from parents? Next - how about recognizing more the enormous effort (time, money, emotion) that parents put into raising the next generation? Next - economic incentives get a mention, but tbh what's offered is microscopic compared to the real costs. In the UK - pitiful verging on insulting.<br>

Aka - more is different, enough quantity is new quality. Amusingly in ML we decide to chop-off extra dimensions after PCA on the account of "the amount of variance is not big enough" (to warrant extra dimension i.e. new quality). With PCA the criterion is "linear transform vanishes the quantity along that quality/dimension". In general we are looking at "general computer program vanishing the extra dimension by predicting it" or articulating the same in terms of "compression".<br>

Yeah - MSM will fail for any basic trick repeatedly, they are real gluttons for that. After all the talk of misinformation, they still go forth and amplify for the 101-st time the source that lied 100 times before. RUS dis/info tactics of "flood the field with sh*t" i.e. lie mercilessly in industrial quantities with the strategic goal of annihilating even the possibility of "the truth" existing seems to get them. NB while swallowing it all they still scrupulously maintaining plausible deniability with "... X said so and so". So there must be at some level some doubt about the truth of their reporting.<br>

All uk.gov business should be public online by default (and gov can close some by request; the opposite of current "secret by default, open some by FOI request). Likewise for lobbyists and similar shaping public policy - need to move to "all in the open" by default. Radical transparency FTW!<br>

Totally puzzling. Non-stop talk of misinformation and fake news, yet MSM goes on and amplifies for the 101-st time a source that lied 100 times before. One would've thought RU dis/info tactics of "flood the field with sh*t" i.e. lie mercilessly in industrial quantities with the strategic goal of annihilating even the possibility of "the truth" existing, wd be right up the MSM alleyway Re: "misinformation". Scrupulously maintaining plausible deniability while amplifying dis/info is a losing proposition for MSM. 🤦‍♂️🤷‍♂️<br>

@BBC asleep at the wheel - combo of inertia and laziness, willful stupidity, some incompetence... and UK not directly attacked yet (only ex/RUS subjects in the UK). Still - BBC is "to inform & educate", and RUS strategy of "flood the field with sh*t" i.e. lie mercilessly in industrial quantities to annihilate the possibility of truth existing should be right up their alleyway. BBC even make noises Re: "misinformation"... - yet continue to misinform us while scrupulously maintaining plausible deniability ("... - Moscow"). Don't see what BBC gains and see plenty they lose with this "strategy", but 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️<br>

If there is political will - everything is possible. In extremis - All-1ctry can leave current EU, create new EUv2 minus the 1ctry. EU is union of independent states - what these states decide, it shall be so. In the end - the member states make the EU laws. If they really really want to kick-out someone - they can find the way.<br>

<br>People are instinctively communist b/c we have all been children and raised in a family, and in a family "we get according to our needs, we contribute according to our abilities". Academics are instinctively anti-market, b/c there is not real market in ideas (+hard to measure results & assign rewards). Happens with businessmen too - when turned politicians, they assume country ought to be run like a business. Usually that fails too. Peoples' thinking is largely influenced by their experiences. That's an OK thing tbh (& preferable to e.g. "hearing the voice of god"). Just that it's insufficient. Like there is not a universal cure for all ills (regardless of diagnosis), there is not a silver bullet societal organization that universally works for all people/geographies/times. On empirical evidence of last 250 years, more freedom - of thought, speech, action, trade etc - seems better. But little else to go on.<br>

Hm, disagree there. N=1 means giving 100% to my personal favorite 1, disregarding the remaining 999. Tad egoistic that imo. In contrast, when (statistically) considering all N=1000 attention is given to all 1000, no one is left out, they are treated equally.<br>

The problem for PL is at the time they find out - it will be too late (c.f. 1-Sep-1939 and aftermath). Don't see what's the problem for Poland+Balts developing home grown nuclear deterrent. Israel faced with similar existential threat (=much bigger neighbors hostile & intent on its destruction) with much fewer resources (money, people, material) did it within <10 years. France facing no real existential threat did it too. It's just lack of political will and leadership tbh.<br>

Well said on the property rights. Yes - we all agree they are useful and lead to human flourishing. However, let's not delude kid ourselves - they are not "intrinsic" or "natural" in any way. They are human made constructs, to channel our behavior while living in large groups together with other humans. Nothing natural about them. Natural laws (e.g. like gravity) have no need for any legislation or social contracts - they just work all the time for everyone and everything (e.g. the apple falls to earth) and that's it. Wish they were natural! Then human groups would be better off (on the empirical evidence available), as there would be one hoop less to jump over on the journey to prosperity.<br>

1. "Minority or 90%" - yeah IDK, ideally would like to see numbers how many. Anecdotally comparing motorway driving in France to UK I was surprised by the difference. 2. "Selfish" - ofc they are selfish, everyone is selfish (and selfless too) to some extent. That's ok. Turning public policy into morality plays is rarely conductive to good policy. Our laws are not made with the assumption we are perfect or angels - and that's a good thing. 3) "MORE lane changes" - IDK a  traffic engineer may know more, I'm thinking "it depends". It depends on whether they are a minority or a majority, and how big one at that.<br>

Not an argument that. For own education:  common online debating tricks is 1) take opponents' argument 2) take it to the extreme 3) say "well that's obv ridiculous". Obv we should not review the law on murder b/c murders happen. Obv if 90% of the drivers in the UK are hogging the middle lane, maybe we should think about changing something (e.g. US laws are a bit different, and they still manage to drive). Obv murder and hogging the middle lane are transgressions of different severity. There are usually gradations in this world - few things maybe 0/1 true/false good/bad, but most things are shades of gray. Like think of them being on the scale of 0 to a 100. Murder - very bad 100, hogging the lane - mild transgression 5.<br>

I try diligently not to be. That's how I notice that compliance is low. Compliant in the UK are a minority and it creates tension with the (non-compliant) majority. Compare-contrast with say driving in France: there non-compliance is a source of tension as most are compliant. But it's not important what I personally do or don't do. My point is: if a law is not obeyed by a vast majority, maybe it's worth looking at it.<br>

We have France (where I noticed drivers stick to the right lane rule much more than in the UK) and US (where undertaking is allowed) to compare and contrast. My observation is that in the UK this Highway code rule is broken about 90% of the time. If a law is broken routinely - maybe it needs a rethink. Aside - I know driving brings the worst in some people, but looks like in you writing about driving brings out spicy language too. Please refrain from it if you possibly can. Makes any discussion about best ways forward needlessly harder.<br>

Maybe the highway code needs updating. Maybe need a risk assessment update about the additional risk generated by additional lanes changes, the additional risks of the 1st lane (worse road surface, very slow vehicles/esp at night) versus other parameters of interest (throughput etc). Maybe a traffic engineer cd point to papers or studies on this.<br>

Covid provided natural experiment for UK recently. Once C19 was considered a threat to the nation, the UK gov solved homelessness within a fortnight. On the opposite side - gov also decided to make people homeless again once Covid passed! And so that happened too. So we have it as watertight as it can possibly be in realms of public policy (almost at Koch's postulates level): homelessness can be solved fairly quickly and cheaply - once a government decides to solve it.<br>

Radical transaprency FTW: make all http://UK.gov business (central gov, civil service, local gov ...) public on the web by default. Reverse the current assumption of secret by default, and only partially opened to us suffering citizens on request and piecemeal via laborious FOI  process. Yes people-in-power (ministers, civil servants, CEO-s) will try to get smart and 1. Obfuscate (wink-wink-nod-nod, double speak) and 2. Hide ("self-destructing" WhatsApp messages) but these are easier problems than the blanket secrecy, and can be addressed in turns. First things first - radical transparency FTW!! :-)<br>

That's one factor (quality), not the only one. Next step is to quantify that and other factors (qualities), so to be able to compute derive (aggregate/marginalize/average) non-obvious theses that require quantified chain of reasoning. Exemplified by http://rooclaim.com e.g. https://rootclaim.com/analysis/What-is-the-source-of-COVID-19-SARS-CoV-2<br>
 and applicable to any investigation. Works anywhere we collect always imperfect evidence and have to weight competing explanations. I'm surprised this is not mandatory training for at least judges if not all barristers and solicitors too!

Only full home grown nuclear deterrent of Poland+Baltic states (prev Ukraine - but that options is lost now) can short circuit our spiraling into WW3 imo. We are not even sleepwalking - we are going in awake with eyes wide open, but lacking the will to imagine ways out of it.<br>

I think you are onto something there with the "...genocide but not of the Nazi- or -Rwanda type". Maybe not a total physical destruction, but enough plus destruction of resources, culture, elites etc so to destroy the possibility of a nation and nationhood. Maybe we need better words distinguishing between the types. The fact that one or both sides are sometimes their worst enemies and the situation seems hopeless with no solution in sight (solution requires 2 willing sides, atm there are 0) does not distract from your (very lucid) observation about the nature of what is happening.<br>

Well - 1. Wind & solar are unreliable by design => require backup by design. 2. Reliables options are: coal (dirty - so no), nuclear (feared & hated - so no) => leaves natural gas as the least bad option 3. EU shutdown its own gas fields (e.g. Groningen) and banned fracking => import of NG from Russia became the default.<br>

The IT contribution in governance will be 1) parliamentary processes of legislation drafting, updating and maintenance all online all fairly public and deliberations wiki-like (easy-to-moderate) 2) total surveillance of the individual allows for ever more precise organization; rotten apples detected earlier & thrown out of the barrel before it spoils; this is a well as the larger the number of people the more complex the society => the greater the risk (due to inter-connectivity) => threshold percent bad actors of societal breakdown gets lower (already happening - we're all under surveillance by default) 3) radical transparency on the part of the state towards the individual - all state civil service processes open published on the web by default, secret only by request; opposite of how things are atm - all closed by default, only partial open via laborious FOI requests (very hard - the state will fight this tooth and nail, as it's a source of great power to them and great weakness to us citizens).<br>

Hm - I use gmail for everything and have not had my email thrashed yet? Don't even use the alternate userX+signupY@gmail.com email + followup filtering trick much. On the rare occasion when something goes through I "Report Spam" on the web GUI, it notices if it's a list I "subscribed" to, offers to unsubscribe me, I click "Yes please". For regular non-spam updates (e.g. Notifications) I do "Filter messages like these" to "tag" them aka "move them away form Inbox into their own folder" and apply that to all existing messages in my Inbox. Other than that - everything stays in the Inbox.<br>

That would refute their ideas and their galaxy sized egos can not take that hit. Similar to how the early socialists' small size (community wide) experiments in the US (all failed in a generation) were labelled "utopian socialism" (whereas they were exactly the opposite - a real empirical small scale trials) by the so called self declared "scientific socialists" (that were actually more like a cult).<br>

Uh-oh, too much like rerun of 1938+ history there, impossible to not notice. Expansionist European power with a galaxy sized grievance, annexing the nearby regions 1st, then gobbling up the whole country, on the pretext of taking care of its kin + feeling threatened. Western security guarantees impossible to discharge but impossible to ignore either - for fear that the reminder of the alliances will crumble. Once RU switcheroo to war economy is complete it will look to "where next?". All this is already in motion. One way to short circuit the rolling disaster maybe CEEu countries developing nuclear deterrent? But they don't seem to think so. Worse - some like HU think they will be at the dining table (seems they accepted some RU offer, maybe the one that PL declined), rather than being the meal served (whereas the latter is more likely tbh). What is to be done?<br>

Knowledge is created by research. Re-search == repeated targeted (not blind) search for something that "works". For the "it works" (or not) part machines need feedback from the environment. It will come like in the video you posted here https://twitter.com/leecronin/status/1739773474548113863 . In domains like Go and Chess where machines do get the "it works" (or not) feedback in the search - they have generated new knowledge about those games (how to play them) - is my understanding.<br>

<br>We the UK electorate got it good and hard - this was what the majority voted for. Referendum + 2 general elections since - that's enough testing of the wishes of the electorate. We must take collective and personal responsibility for the outcome - no way around that.<br>

True that. However, this is also true 1) There was a referendum on the change of electoral system - electorate said NO 2) The parties opposed to Brexit could have united forces made a pack and stood down their competing MP candidates (like BoJo and Farage did!) - but chose not to.<br>

Fao @Cookmeister7 - I voted remain, assumed leave will be worse than remain, and the brexit we got is worse than my assumptions (I though we'd fallback to EFTA). I don't like it 😩 any more than you do, but being part of a nation (or union of nations - but UK voted as a whole, as if a single nation) involves taking responsibly for the deeds of other members of the nation.<br>
Aside - I can see how my side lost. @Cookmeister7 can't even get it right who's on his side on who's with the opposition?? ffs<br>

We the UK electorate got it good and hard - this was what the majority voted for. Referendum + 2 general elections since - that's enough testing of the wishes of the electorate. We must take collective and personal responsibility for the outcome - no way around that.<br>

Смени го ако можеш де? Глупо е да плаќаш некому пари за тој да те вреѓа. Ако си мислиш - "ме вреѓа ама барем ме учи", еве да знаеш: постои инструктор што ќе те научи да возиш, а без да те вреѓа. Знам сигурно од лично искуство - постои таков инструктор. Па и да си платила веќе да нема назад враќање на парите - размисли што ти е подобро, дали да ги прежалиш парите и почнеш со друг (ама нему не му плаќај однапред, туку pay-as-you-go), или да се мачиш и понатаму со сегашниот инструктор.<br>

Boxing day heart-warming treat 😍 - @veritasium 's "What The Prisoner's Dilemma Reveals About Life, The Universe, and Everything" https://youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM . The best strategies for the iterated repeated game were all 1) nice - cooperate by default 2) forgiving - do not hold a grudge to retaliate forever 3) retaliatory - don't be pushover (e.g. tit-for-tat is a must) 4) clear - the opponent can sense your logic. Further - a cluster of minority nice strategies will over time out-perform and take over the space where majority is nasty strategies at start. Life shaping it's own environment for the betterment for all! 😊😊<br>

Well - "understanding" is a nebulous concept as it is in the head of the person, and we can't open their head and see what's in there. (NTS we can - but we see nothing there) *Describing* is weakest, *forecasting* is stronger, *creating* is even stronger, on the scale of "understand". A person has full understanding of something iif they are able to 1) describe + 2) forecast + 3) create (from scratch) the thing that is "understood".<br>

Exactly! Radical transparency FTW!! Instead of "everything secret by default, citizens only get crumbs of information via laborious time consuming FOI request" (and even then - state only reveals what it pretty pleases), us citizens need to push for "everything public on the web by default, the state gets to keep things secret upon JFI request granted". That's the way to start leveling the playfield. Note all presently ongoing scandals investigations - C19 response, PPI fast lanes looting - spend ginormous effort just to get to the basic info. RADICAL TRANSPARENCY FTW 😁😁<br>

"I forecast tomorrow will be sunny". Tomorrow comes - and it's cloudy, not sunny. Now I can choose between 1) I accept it's sunny. I was wrong not right. I see the world accurately. 2) I don't accept it's sunny. I maintain - I was right (in my forecast). I outright deny it's cloudy, say "nah it looks sunny to me", I try to weasel out by redefining the words "sunny" and "cloudy" ("how much sun/cloud?"), and any number of other sophistic tricks. I see the world less accurately.<br>
So in case#1 the state of play is (not right, accurate), in case#2 (right, not accurate). So in my mind in this example there is tension between "right" and "accurate" - they don't always necessarily go together. They can also go against each other - I have to admit I was "not right" in order to be "accurate". hth<br>

Yes, and that's exactly what worries me about UBI. Cooperation is what creates a group out of the individuals. Us individuals lose some of our personal freedom (to gain other things dearer to us - that's why we do it). Some of that cooperation is forced - the alternative for me the individual is going hungry and ending up dead. Will we be able to cooperate flexibly in large numbers if every individual is absolutely free, once no amount of coercion (however small) is possible? I understand that liberalism - i.e. ever increasing the power of the individual so to exercise its individual freedom - has been the huge success starting 1800+. Just fearing if pushing liberty to the limit - will push the society over the limit?<br>

Yes 2/3 - "to be honest and see the world accurately" - yes. No 1/3 - "to be right". "Be right" is not super important for me, I have not got that strong an ego. It's pleasant when the future shows me right (& does not undermine my mental model), and unpleasant when it shows me wrong. I also tend to lose $$$ when wrong about the future, so it's a double whammy: not only has my mental model been found wanting (ouch), I have also lost $$$ (ouch indeed - "that physically hurts, wtaf, get me out of here, make the pain stop!!!"). I can't not notice that most of the time "life teaches you a lesson" moments people around seem to perceive as "this is an attack on me personally". That I find strange and tad narcissistic ("nope - the universe is not that interested in you, you are not that special") - and try to avoid that (natural reflex?).<br>

За било што друго - се имаше некој проблем. Чистењето на четките и кутивчето со ѓубре беа незгодни. Кога се расипа - не купивме друга.<br>

The constitutionally guaranteed "dictatorship of technocracy" requires such high level of *earned* social trust (repeat - earned!), such insanely good selection process to select not just the smart, honest and hard-working, but also to select out the in-sane (that may also be smart), to positions of power, that IDK if it offers much transferable knowledge to UK, except that "another way is possible". But then we already know that TINA is almost never correct, there is usually another way.<br>

Less important whether the claim "x50 times" (compared to what baseline) is true or not (there are many similar neuromorphic chips).<br>

I would disagree with "pay isn't a problem here". Are you saying if they were offered 100K, then they would not fill many more vacancies? I put to you that that would be an extraordinary argument. It's a matter of degree. At 50K offered - 140K vacancies. At 80K offered - there will be less vacancies. And so on<br>

Yes - so that's an argument against. I believe this is an argument that proponents of Job Guarantee (JG) make. On the other hand - it maybe less of a yes/no question, more a "how much" question. So if UBI was £10 pcm - probably noone would mind. If it was £10K pcm - that would obviously be a disaster.<br>
We already have not-quite-but-almost-Universal Basic Income for 1) old people (old age pension) 2) people with cash savings (interest rate) 3) people in work on low wages (similar to negative tax?) 4) very young people (children benefit). For these too - it's a question of level, of quantity, not of quality (whether we do them yes/no). Don't think any UBI would be that much different in that respect.<br>
I am concerned that without the ultimate threat of "you will die" it might be impossible to make people cooperate in large numbers (when they decide they don't want to). So that freedom maybe good for each of us (individuals) that increases my personal power, but may destroy society (the group) whose power it decreases. I doubt there is a an easy or complete solution, would expect to be more a series of imperfect compromises that avoid the worst.<br>

True that, but, on the other hand - unemployment and vacancies can never be exactly 0. So there is always some non-0 number. The question becomes - what's a low enough number that we should aim for? Construction industry - they could double the salary offered and they could fill a good number of those 140K. So the unfilled vacancies are always "... under these conditions offered" (salary & the rest).<br>

Lack of incentive to work well & hard - yes, I would agree about that under socialism. One could not be fired easily, so one could coast with 1) show up at work in time 2) do the minimum required. So not enough stuff was produced and done, also productivity was low, so economic growth was slow (after 1970). In that sense, it bears familiarity with the in-work benefits in the UK.<br>

I can concur with this now, changed my mind. I thought I'll give the interview a miss, but watched the start (where space travel is discussed) and he seemed genuinely enthusiastic. What resonated with me was that we should aim to outsource manufacturing to space. (I thought a moon base - but I imagine there's no great benefit to that compared to in-space)<br>

My guess would be - it depends on the level. We already have BI for old people (pension), for rich people (>0 interest rate), and in some geographies - Alaska has not turned communist yet. Again - it's good to read on arguments already put forward, as the this one (and previous) one you raised - have been discussed (many times). I wish there was a Frequently Asked Questions FAQ one could consult on UBI. Whatever Q we think of - likely they have been asked before.<br>

I can't say I'm 100% forever convinced myself, but - if you are interested to consider arguments for-against, it's a good start to assume "whatever I'm to ask, it's been asked x10 times before - and answered". So if you are interested - possibly check e.g. https://twitter.com/scottsantens/status/1040683616488103936<br>

These 2 are probably the top-2 arguments in the FAQ about this. The standard answers are:<br>
1) "Why" - IDK, I would not do it, but some people like that. Why sail around the world, find a passage to India, find the source of Nile, go to the North or South pole, climb Mount Everest etc etc ... To me it makes more sense to build an industrial colony on the Moon, produce anything needed for space exploration there, so to not have to lift zillion tons of material from Earth fighting the force of gravity.
2) "Fix all Earth problems before" (and the general "why X when Y is not done") - this is a general argument and can be applied to any endeavor. It's not that a strong argument. Yeah, it would be great if we fixed all Earth problems. But it can't be said that going to Mars is stopping us fixing the problems. There is not a causal relationship between the two. We could both "fix Earth problems" (=Y) and "fly to Mars" (=X). We could do both, either of them, or none. X does not preclude Y and v.v. In general the same argument and applies to any endeavor, so if we accept it, we would never do anything. HTH

Нема толку врска едно со друго. Поважно е сите да бидат 100% ЗА било која не-тотално-луда опција (да има консензус), а не 50:50 За:Против. Еве на пр слушај за консензусот во Бугарија во 1996 кога никој не ги есапел 2% за прием. Тоа, и малку среќа - за Бугарија, Кипар и др во 1999 - војната во Косово ги уплашила Германија и Франција па се премислиле за "православни не се европјани" 😁😁<br>

If you are not able to care - gift the originals away, offer them to the public that volunteers to keep them, or burry the crates in a field somewhere. Anything but willful destruction. Destruction reeks of irresponsible hubris. It'd be like doctors breaking the Hipocratic oath. You are archivists ffs. How can you even think of destroying intentionally the primary sources.

This kind of thinking is plain stupid - it's that simple, unfortunately. Stupid=="takes action that harms the other, while gaining nothing for self or even at slight self-loss". B/c of this, stupid is the most dangerous kind, as for non-stupid, it's impossible to predict what a stupid will do. It just makes no rational sense. :-( Against ample evidence to the contrary of the past 2yrs and the previous 10yrs, this kind of thinking persists. Putin gains, not loses, support when the country is at war. War time is good times for a dictator - it's peace times are  dangerous. Same for the elite around Putin that support and sustain him.<br>

Time only will tell what happens. Don't think there is enough EU carrot for any in WB, not only MK (there's been on WB movement in the last 10 yrs). Wrt MK-BG specifically - this to me looks like another 30yrs of "will stand still zero movement":<br>
> "... when leaders in Bulgaria say `please recognize a minority' ... they have in mind not few thousand people ... but half of your population ... everybody that has a Bulgarian passport ... so the longer you are outside EU, the more people will get Bulgarian passport ... the moment you make this concession, you will end up not in the EU, but with a new internal conflict ..."<br>

Hey @X @elonmusk - it's a human here not a program or a bot - despite X thinking otherwise (see the bottom of the screenshot). I am denied service I lawfully paid for on false pretense.bYou remain mute like a black hole that no information escapes from. Your conduct is pitiful.<br>

I support AI companions. Humans are tad too full with themselves, as if we are the centre of the universe. First Kopernikus, then Darwin, showed us we are not as special as we think we are. But we are slow learners. So AI should help us recalibrate - and that's a good thing.<br>

Yeah - there is always that concern, esp considering we know so little in things we do, there is only ever a tiny kernel of solid knowledge, and the rest is all trial-and-error and a directed repeated search for something that will work in the end (re/search). Usually - and hopefully it will be this time too - a bigger problem is solved, and then the solution creates a smaller problem. Then we try to solve that one... :-)<br>

And given that almost the entire world is addicted to something, from  fatty food to smartphones to online poker to fentanyl, this could be a  miracle from medical heaven.

That we deny, we forbid - forbid!! - the opportunity for the refugees to work while whatever else is going on in the legal process, and we keep doing that for many years, must be one of the most stupid and evil policies ever that damages everyone. Have not seen much written about this - how did this truly stupid policy come to be, how come it's not been challenged 1st intellectually in the world of ideas then politically practically. Just total silence and we accept it as if there can be no other way. Whereas - it can be very different, can be changed with a stroke of pen.<br>

Noone. Noone gave nuclear deterrent to Israel or North Korea either. Balts+Poland+Nordics can build them for themselves, they can develop them themselves. If Israel - much smaller, weaker and poorer country - could do it after after 1960s, then European countries can do it too.<br>

Forbidden by whom, how? They are sovereign, and given it's a *deterrent*, against a gigantic neighbor armed to the teeth and openly threatening them, don't think anyone can begrudge them anything. Israel and North Korea didn't wait for anyone else to say "yes go do it".<br>

TBF it's overdue that Germany (and Poland,  Balts, Nordics) got their own nuclear deterrent. Amazing how sanguine they all are with nuclear armed neo-empiriral neighbor as large as all of them combined, in full territorial expansion mode, with a long history of doing this exact same thing, and they just sit do nothing and wait for their turn to come.<br>

Nice! One of the all time favorites - thanks for the reminder :-) - episodes here https://bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00ghvd8/episodes/player<br>
TBF I agree with the thesis Transparency==Surveillance. Will read it once free (TBD), but before reading 😱😱 to push mildly back against the implied "... and that maybe bad", I'd say on balance it's likely to be more good than bad. Yes, it is possible that we clam into secrecy & stop communicating/sharing or even worse start lying. However:<br>
1) Us civilians not in positions of power are already under surveillance - even if mostly voluntary via social media. For people in positions of huge power to be granted secrecy as default strikes me as an odd step. I think on the contrary - radical transparency should be the default.<br>
2) My own experience of making decisions under uncertainty with risk and consequence (only much $$$/livelihoods staked - but not actual human lives) is that transparency/surveillance made me more honest with myself in how much I know and don't know and what I can reasonably claim to be true.<br>
3) Thinking back I think secrecy would have added to the pressure, not distracted.  Being less than completely transparent would have offered the temptation of an easy road out wrt my own ego. But that would have been an illusion. The only way to survive with sanity intact is to write down in the open everything that influenced the decision, warts and all. Everything else comes back to byte you.<br>

Is there any hope ever that a GP will prescribe it? Atm my GP refuses to prescribe it to me. Didn't completely understand to what extent it's "can't" v.s. "won't" (on the consultation). I'm buying it online myself atm for £200 (lower) and £300 (higher dosages), for 4 weeks.<br>

We don't learn from history so we're bound to repeat it. We'll be "lucky" if it stays conventional and not go nuclear. Courtesy of LLMs -<br>
Key events leading up to and during the early stages of World War II, particularly focusing on German and Soviet expansion.<br>
German Expansion:<br>
1936: Germany reoccupies the Rhineland in violation of the Treaty of Versailles.<br>
1938: Germany annexes Austria (Anschluss) and the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia following the Munich Agreement.<br>
1939: Germany invades Poland, prompting Britain and France to declare war, marking the beginning of World War II.<br>
Soviet Expansion:<br>
1939: The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact is signed between Germany and the Soviet Union, secretly dividing Eastern Europe into spheres of influence.<br>
1939: The Soviet Union invades Finland, leading to the Winter War.<br>
1940: The Soviet Union annexes parts of Romania.<br>
1940: The Soviet Union invades and occupies the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania).<br>
These events illustrate the geopolitical developments and aggressions that set the stage for the broader conflict of World War II. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, in particular, played a significant role in shaping the early stages of the war by redistributing territories in Eastern Europe.<br>

😆😆 Ok, it maybe cheesy, but is it untrue? That the chances are that today, this particular day, is not that turning point. I am not disputing that it happens - I'm saying chances are against it happening  today (when I conveniently happened to think about this stuff). For us to have that much meta-knowledge, knowledge-about-other-knowledge, not only that something new will be discovered but also the timing of it - that would be indeed incredibly useful. But I've seen no evidence that we have any handle there (and plenty that we don't). I don't disagree that we 1) learn (science) then 2) exploit (technology) and then 3) that well runs dry and we have to dig another one. Re-search is mostly directed re-peated-search for something that works. Impossible to tell if or when something will work out in advance. In academia & industrial research always thought project/funding proposals "we will do X and figure out Y" were fools errand, a waste of bits. Physicists thought there is little left to discover in physics at the start of the 20c. (e.g. - "diminished returns"). Then a decade latter nuclear and quantum stuff (smallest of sizes) and relativity (largest of sizes) happened that ushered our current age of the atom, the micro-electronics, and space exploration.<br>

I fear maybe - never. I think the empirical evidence around the world is - the higher the proportion of the unreliable wind-solar in the mix, the higher the retail price. I installed rooftop solar in my home (covers ~50% of my demand), betting the electricity price is going ever higher. TBS what happens.<br>

Fwiw it's a non trivial Q 😱 for most people (as e.g. the likes of heads-or-tails wd be), and kudos to the Harvard doctors for reaching even 20%. I'd have expected more like 1-in-a-100 tbh! 😬 Maybe one way to drum it into our heads would be to have Bayes odds learned by rote?<br>

You have no way of knowing what will or will not happen in the future (neither do I, nor does anyone else). However - in the past they have done it. And they are telling us daily that they will do it again. They have put their industry on a war footing. Once the war machine gets traction - it will be hard for them to stop with UKR. Wars have life of their own, few end up the way initiators anticipated they will.<br>

On the contrary - I don't want that for myself, my children, and I don't want that for anyone's children and grownups too. Hence - nuclear DETERRENT. Deterrent is to deter an aggressor from waging aggressive war of conquest. Like the wars stronger states initiate and wage against their weaker opponents (states) very often (and incl US vv. Iraq). Aggressive war of conquest is the supreme international crime still. It's a good rule that stood the test of time.

Not a solution but pos better than nothing (depending on language and context - mine is C/C++): align them to the right side/margin on screen, have :set nowrap to prevent them wrapping. They should be out of sight now, not distracting off the business logic. Chose name that's convenient for quick search&replace (I use capitals for non-business logic) to bring them back to the left in-sight and turn them on, e.g :s/^\s\+NOLOGP/LOGP/ where NOLOGP a placeholder for "logging off", LOGP is a placeholder for "logging on".<br>

Extremes like that are unlikely and unproductive. More likely that a steady push for a longish period of time in the same direction to work out in the end. They have time. Democracies change course every 10-15 years over 2-3 electoral cycles. Russia can wait them out - just needs to stay on course.<br>

Russia has been dominating one way or another its smaller weaker neighbors to its west/south-west (Baltics inc Finland, Central Europe, Balkans) for the last 200+yrs. From Moscow looking to the west and south, these puny neighbors do look like quarrelsome & silly piglets, that are very much into themselves, self-absorbed in their petty disputes, and regularly failing to spot the big wolf right behind them. They make tasty morsels and are not too hard to get. Russia interests are clear and they articulate them completely and frequently. I see this earth-shattering news (not!) has not reached you yet. If the history of how WW2 started (one episode of many - the one that got out of control, so we all get to learn abt it in school) means nothing to you - don't think anyone can teach you anything really. What you call "cyber warfare" is wider non-military means to influence those countries. If that fails, Russia will move to military means. As was with Georgia (non-military worked eventually), Belarus (non-military) and currently Ukraine (non-military domination finally failed by 2014 so Russia only remaining options left was to switch to military means of control).<br>

Balts+Poland must join forces & develop credible nuclear deterrent in the next 5 years if they want to live. US maybe willing to fight for London or Paris (maybe), but certainly is not going to fight back if RU nukes Warsaw. 1939 was lesson enough for CEEu one'd have though - but apparently not. If Israel could do it half a century ago much smaller and poorer, CEE states should be able to cut it.<br>

The VitD multi-season soap opera can be thought in postgraduate research studies where they teach methodology of research and similar as "here are several case studies in how re/search can fail to reach conclusion (either yes or no) in the most pedestrian ways possible that any researcher should e able to surmount with a modicum of effort and intelligence". Starting with a case study of how the initial flawed recommended dosing was 10x too small (ok, mistakes happen) and subsequently paper correcting that (published every few years) have somehow failed to take hold in the minds of scientists, regulators, public health officials (not ok) that really should know (and do) better.<br>

That would require that we live in this one unique moment, among the billions of moments, where we have reached diminishing returns. Like being in that one turning point after 1000 points of uptrend, things turn, and we have 1000 points of downtrend after. That sole 1 point where things turn - for us to figure we are in that exact spot, well, the laws of probability work against us. Hence - skeptical that any one person can identify the point in realtime.<br>

TBF the "reasoning loop" is still open (no feedback), so the model does probably as bad as an average human wd when asked a similar Q & having their 1st stab at it (before running it for feedback). It'll get wild 😱 when the model not only 1) produces code, but then 2) runs it, and 3) gathers results, then 4) feeds the difference  result minus expectation 5) back to the input for a 6) 2nd shot. And then 7) repeats that a few times. I imagine the likes of @demishassabis<br>
 are not merely thinking abt this but actually doing sth about 1-7. 🤩 A natural->programming lang forward that then gets program->natural backward in the feedback loop wd also be a good spin on the man-vs-machine, if I may say. 😂<br>

It takes lots of (mis)education to get to the point of being this willfully stupid. Descriptions like banality of evil, intellectuals yet idiots (IYI) come to mind. First thought was "unbelievable", then I remembered not only believable but actually seen before.<br>

If Russia was capturing Kyev - why not? What's a State have to lose when it's being gobbled up consumed by another State? Nukes are for self-preservation of a State. Most of Europe recent history is about predation of one state over another, and wars are for survival (or extinguishing) of a State.<br>

Best thing I ever did for myself - LASIK. Everything was amazing - 3D mapping of he eyeball beforehand, being operated by laser (robot?) 2x10sec x 2 eyes. And the morning after (after sleeping for 18 hours) was the most spectacular morning ever for me. The sights so clear a morning view - incomparable to anything I'd experienced visually up to that point in my life.<br>

Observing from close vicinity, think this covers most bases: conspiracy theory has great psychological appeal as it delivers emotional relief where there are problems with 1) the self (shaky self-esteem/narcissism); 2) others (xenophobia, paranoia); and 3) the World (epistemic matters; e.g. the need for certainty in an uncertain world). Further it can supply 4) certainty, in response to overwhelming anxiety (a sure path when one feels lost); 5) prestige, where there are self-esteem problems (‘I possess important information most people do not have); 6) ability (‘I have the power to reject “experts” and expose hidden cabals’); 7) vindication when one feels besieged (my ‘enemies’ are wrong, morally, scientifically)’; 8) connection when one feels alone; and 9) liberation:, ‘If I imagine my foes are completely malevolent, then I can use any tactic I want’.<br>

Excellent - hits the nail on the head. Yeah, competition and -ve feedback loop is fine and dandy and may lead to improvement via error correction. However - it's only 1/2 of the group relations. The remaining 1/2 is +ve feedback - cooperation, coordination, agreement, working pulling the weight together. Competition is most useful at deciding what the group should do, formulating a plan. To execute the plan and get things done - the group needs cooperation and coordination.<br>

Allowing GP-s to prescribe it on the NHS so we can get it for £10 (cost of prescription) rather than £200-£300 (online @ Cheimst4U, price depending on the dose) would be a 1st step. That GP-s can't prescribe it to people who need it & are will to take it & ask for it is insanity.<br>

On Gov inflating the currency - there is some of that, but most of the currency (80%) is created via commercial banks lending. Currently most of that lending (creation of money) is secured lending against property.<br>

Empirically - lending was probably too strict under the gold standard. The world economy took off once that  constraint was loosened. Preceded by other  attempts to loosen it - e.g. the bi-metalism movement in the US (the original populists of the cross of gold speech), getting off it during major economic depression crisis, etc.<br>

Because residents have a direct interest in maintaining the building, they will actively engage in hiring and firing managing agents, ensuring value for money. As a bonus, this grants us control over our costs and, consequently, our lives. A stark contrast to freeholders and their closely aligned managing agents that care not about the buildings. What kind of conservative finds this perplexing?<br>

Yeah - true that, much depends on the EM ambitions for TW. Fwiw conflict between advertisers' interests and the publisher, esp when adv dislikes pub content, and especially when pub is critical of the adv on the same pages where adv advertises (and this supports the pub) - is the oldest conflict in publishing industry. :-) Little new under the sun. Maybe the novelty here is  frenemies push-pull angle free speech v.s. moderation. Every online platform stumbles onto moderation (different to censorship). Looks X is walking the well trodden path albeit twists&turns on the way. This https://twitter.com/ErrataRob/status/1730300012058362335 addresses some, and @yishan had a good thread on the same at the time of EM TW purchase. I thought EM had a plan to use ML of some sort (sth like ChatGPT is now) to scale up the moderation. Only way at scale - otherwise all manually impossible to moderate TW.<br>

Well... - yeah? "Cap weighted index" by definition is one where the weight of every index member is proportional to its market cap. Attractive b/c as the market cap changes due to price fluctuations, weight changes automatically, so the actual number of shares held in the company by the index for the purpose of tracking does *not* need to change. So it's self-balancing, no (costly) trading is needed needed to maintain index tracking.<br>

UA is defending, RU is attacking - not the other way around. The war can stop tomorrow if RU decides to just go home on their side of the border. However - the history of imperial RU, then SU, then post-1990, is one where the constant is: RU total control of UA, by political means if possible, by military if necessary. Also logical thinking about RU strategic interests as they perceive them (and themselves too). Aside: personal imputations allusions discussions of the messenger rather than the message are not on. But feel free to discuss ideas.<br>

... ha - what fools, they got played, as opposed to - taking the opportunity to get murdered by RU? Their options are - 1) dig in, fight, maybe something will happen, you may get help, you may survive to fight another day/some of you may live; or 2) surrender, top 1% are bribed co-opted by RU to stay in power loyal to RU, next 9% intelligentsia are all murdered wiped out, bottom 90% fall in line grudgingly and mostly accept: no UA nation no language no freedom no anything. Way worse then being a 2nd Belarus tbh. Their options are "freedom or death". For all talk abt Putin being "the cornered rat" - for RU the war is optional non-existential, for UA not-losing is existential.<br>

Wish I was as optimistic - but imo you are deluding yourself about the possibility of a deal. The problem of trust is well known. UKR decided for themselves why they can't take the offer: b/c they think RUS will break it in the future and attack them again (as has happened already). TBF don't see fault with that, it is supported by evidence and logic.<br>
This -<br>
> "Secondly, there was no confidence in the Russians that they would do it. This could only be done if there were security guarantees. We could not sign something, step away, everyone would relax there, and then they would [invade] even more prepared – because they had, in fact, gone in unprepared for such a resistance. Therefore, we could only explore this route when there is absolute certainty that this will not happen again. There is no such certainty."<br>

It's not only the compute power. It's the (distributed) data collection. It's the "skin in  the game" keeping people honest (people that risk their own money, ultimately livelihood). Multiple smaller distributed searches maybe more costly than one global big search, but it's worth it: their worst case is better than the one global search worst case. To end up in global worst, the N local searches have all have to end in global worst, while for one global search, only one has to. We care about the average case (as very probable), almost never care about the best case (too improbable), but we really really care about the worst case. Even if it's improbable, the consequences ending in it are so severe, that we care a lot about the worst case.<br>

The neo-liberal consensus of the past 30 years had winners and losers. Losers are unhappy and they want change. There are enough losers now to exert electoral influence. Neolib is fine in moderation, but what is good will be 1st done and then *over*done - we are at that stage. Things need to change in order for them to stay the same. Alas - the winners that will be overwhelmingly the current centrists are finding that hard to swallow, internalize and act on. So the current trends will continue.<br>

I heard the term sado-populisim and I think there is something to it.<br>
1) I'm elected on a ticket of "change everything/drain the swamp" by people whose lives are bad - they want change.<br>
2) I proceed to not only not try help those voters, but actively and intentionally make their lives even harder.<br>
3)  Now my voters will be doubly rooting for a change!<br>
4) New election cycle - I run on the same ticket of "radical change".<br>
5) People's memories are short, I muddy the waters, blame my ever expanding list of enemies for things getting worse. Admit nothing, forever double down.<br>
What am I missing in this "evil cynical" strategy?<br>
Like with every time X is tried and fails to work - one might say "X does not work", but proponents can always retort "X was not tried hard enough, that's why it failed => more X needed, it will work".<br>

As anyone who has ever been responsible for legislative oversight of central bankers knows, they do not like to have their authority challenged. Most of all, they will defend their mystique—that magical aura that hovers over their words, shrouding a slushy mix of banality and baloney in a mist of power and jargon. As a result, tormenting central bankers is great fun. John Maynard Keynes famously tormented Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England (BOE) from 1920 to 1944. Wright Patman and Henry Reuss, two US congressmen who chaired the House Banking Committee in the 1970s, did the same to Federal Reserve Chair Arthur Burns. I know that Reuss enjoyed it; I assisted him at the time.<br>

After I 100% confirmed it with the solicitor, I could not understand how come no one else is freaked out.

Yes - and further: supply-demand work well for stuff like bread b/c there is a negative feedback loop at work. Bread demand outstrips supply => price up => incentivizes the baker => baker bakes more => supply matches demand => price stable => baker stop baking more. On a stock market we can't produce more equity in a company when the demand for AAPL equity outstrips the supply. The supply is hard-limited. Hence there can't be a negative feedback loop at work to match supply-demand and stabilize the price.<br>

What's your opinion on FSB (KGB) though? (the clip is about them) Do you think FSB is exactly the opposite i.e. is an honest fearless seeker for what is true in the world? Or do you think FSB are similar or even much worse? They did ultimately run a system with gulag camps & were instrumental in killing millions in the process - plenty of priors there. Flooding the field with sh*ton of lies so to annihilate any possibility of there being a truth so "nothing is real and everything is possible" strikes me as an effective MO for the information age we live in tbh.<br>

Iako "sloboda ili smart", "nad MK se raga novo sonce na slobodata", "MK slobodna slobodno zivee" se site liberalni slogani (na pr USA revolucionerite vo vojna za nezavisnost imaat skoro isto "give me freedom or give me death"), toa vo MK niti se saka niti se ceni niti se neguva. Liberalnite partii (kako na pk. Dj Marjanovik) stalno imaat <10% od glasacite. I toa nema da se smeni skoro.<br>

Interesting - not, more - barely significant. Interesting (and useful) would be - how can we ensure there is enough supply so that people that meet the NICE criteria can get it prescribed by their GP? How many are left out and we'll bear a long term cost (for short term savings) b/c GP-s avoid to prescribe a costly new drug? The article is one in the long list of "lets splash on the front page everything that can possibly go wrong" so to scare people witless with another ill of modernity b/c that harvest clicks and engagement. Sorry - it's just dumb on the part of the media and rest of IYI.<br>

I like to think Econ is concerned with producing stuff, and the money (token) part (in the stuff-for-money exchange at lowest level) is trivial by comparison. Further, Econ not being completely reality grounded (it's about groups of people doing things, unlike say physics) further makes their task of learning harder: there's no feedback from an objective reality. Finance/trader types are better suited to grok the money part imo. When trading there is the profit/loss to constrain us to some objective reality when we're right/wrong, even if heavily mixed with lucky/unlucky.<br>

Ah-haa! Many thanks - great to learn about that. :-) Then one could apply the same logic to the quarks and gluons etc and wonder again - are they interchangeable, or unique, and why/should we care which one it is?<br>

Speculation is ok for jogging the little grey cells. :-) Saw this proton visualization online recently. Very different to a billiard ball protons were drawn as on the high school black board. Made me ask myself - do we know if all protons are the same/interchangeable, rather than each and every one being unique?<br>

"... They succeed in a way that is a threat to the egos of other people. You can envy a Rockefeller, but he is no threat to your ego. But a guy who comes from Vietnam or Korea with little more than clothes on his back & a few words of broken English, & a decade latter has his own business, & you see his son few years latter getting ready to go to Harvard or MIT... you either have to hate yourself... or you are going to hate him.

Much of Tufton Street is a mask that ugly business interests wear to disguise their messaging. We need to (1) remove the mask by forcing charities to divulge who funds them and (2) remove charitable status from those who are revealed to be mere disguise. https://bylinetimes.com/2023/11/03/time-to-tackle-dark-money-in-politics-as-voters-demand-transparency-over-britains-opaque-think-tanks/<br>

Yeah - a group will have differing conventions to in-groups' versus out-groups' individuals. Words like goyim, kafir, gadjo, gaijin come to mind - neutral by dictionary but can be derogatory in some context. Also russian lozh-vranye - maybe more relevant in the context of taqiyya. Looks like started evolved as defensive practices - but ofc not limited to that now.<br>

Thinking humans have reached that unique limit point seems to me tad narcissistic. Like thinking - I'll nab that one turning point in a graph of 1000 points, 999 of which are trending. Every newborn assumes they & the universe are one, then learns - not. Humans thought they are special & apart from other animals, then - Darwin happens. We thought our Earth is special and all else revolves around it (and by extension - us), then - Copernicus. This thinking we have reached *the* limit (assuming one exists), and just in time in the lifetime of the person writing that - strikes me as baby talk, tbh. @StevenHalAus should know better.<br>

His successor told Ukraine’s president: “We don’t have an army.” What changed between 2014 and 2022 wasn’t Putin or the west, but Ukraine. It built a serious army. Only after it resisted Putin did surprised western countries finally do likewise. Now the battle is for the lands between the two worlds. Ukraine, Georgia and Moldova will either join the west or be recolonised. But however this plays out, western armies won’t defeat Russia. The country has one military advantage over the west and possibly even over China: it treats its citizens as cannon fodder.<br>

Coming back to this - looks like the dis/balance of tails largely determines the shape of the posterior? To paraphrase: a fatter tail always holds its ground - winning over a thinner one, and not giving an inch if in a tie with another FT :-) Wonder if this can be said to be one of SCOFT (by @nntaleb).<br>

Hm - if only it was the management alone. That'd make the problem easier. It's much worse than that: new social media #socmed measure engagement and follow it, and it so happens that a lot of people are much more angry than loving. I can be angry at 20-50-100 people, while love 5-10-20 people only. Old mass media #massmed is cought in this too, now that they compete with #socmed for attention. A real downward spiral. Media pple like @Andrey4Mir and @mgurri have things to say about this (and much more).<br>

Hm - "drugo objasnuvanje nema"? Ima, kako nema: zedov kredit, kupiv stan, go otplativ kreditot za 7-8 godini natplakajki gi mesecnite rati, i sega sum raat. Ete ti drugo objasnuvanje - moeto licno iskustvo so kredit. I pokroce malku poskromno - "ocigledno" e deka nemas dovolno imaginacija da gi zamislis site moznosti/varijanti. Ne deka si ti - tuku deka nikoj od nas nema tolkava imaginacija. Koga se diskutira so nepoznati onlajn, dobro e da se drzis do ideite kako sto se kazani, a bez da zamisluvas koj kazuva, zasto kazuva, zasto sega kazuva (a ne drug pat), zasto ne kazuva nesto drugo (sto ti mislis treba da go kaze) i sl.<br>

Allow pinning of more than 5 lists. The pinned-s list at the top is already scrollable left-right when pinned list overflows - there's no need for the "max 5" restriction. Allow more than 5 lists to be pinned, pretty please.<br>

Don't be daft. Don't spoil the YIMBY brand with idiotic takes like the above. Taking the opposite's (maybe reasonable) argument (or not - that's TBS), stretching it to the extreme, then mocking that extreme (while not addressing the original argument), is the oldest stupid trick in the book of online wars. Every arg is ridiculous when stretched to its extremes. YIMBY gain nothing from that childish stance, and lose support from reasonable undecided middle that would be sympathetic to the YIMBY cause. Take the above thing down if you have any sense.<br>

Very good and as ever unfailingly lucid by Žižek<br>
"Why the West will keep losing in Africa<br>
<br>Neocolonialism is giving birth to a wretched authoritarianism." in @NewStatesman<br>
</p>

<p>
https://newstatesman.com/ideas/2023/09/west-losing-africa-neocolonialism-authoritarianism<br>
Highlights -<br>
However, it is clear that the “anti-colonial” uprisings in Central Africa are even worse than French neocolonialism. The future they bring is that of failed states like Zimbabwe and Myanmar: authoritarian military rule; economic regression into new lows of poverty that profit only the new and corrupt elite; ideological fundamentalism combined with a pushback against “colonial” influences like gay rights. Authentic emancipatory leaders such as Thomas Sankara in Burkina Faso are a distant memory. How can it be that much of Africa finds itself in such a desperate situation, where the only choice is between bad (Western neocolonialism) and worse (fake authoritarian anti-colonialism)? The recent military coup in Gabon was a revolt against both, removing President Ali Bongo in the knowledge that this time the French army was unlikely to intervene.<br>
Is this a universal rule? Fortunately not. Rarely, from time to time and in an unpredictable way, exceptions occur; the mist dispels, clarity prevails and the majority are mobilised for the right reasons. Such moments are history at its purest – moments when years happen within the scope of a week.<br>

So the extra_stuff "$a" was *not* done to $a, as if it had been commented out. (extra_stuff was more longer and involved, could not be bothered to re/type)<br>

My thinking on the "How" is - no theory is perfect, any social theory is sometimes right other times wrong. Human societies are not like atoms, politics is not physics etc.<br>
Imo realists' error Re UKR is: UKR out of RUS orbit is not existential to nuclear RUS, is more like Vietnam/Iraq to USA or Afghanistan to RUS/USA, despite what's said.<br>
But - if RUS elects to pursue restoration of empire (after the Russian and Soviet) in CEEurope (as it looks it will), then CEEu have no choice but to go for deterrent. Looks like nuclear deterrent against an aggressor works, while nuclear for an aggressor attacking a country is not that useful. Recently saw on that https://thinkscotland.org/2023/07/is-mearsheimer-being-proven-right-about-nuclear-deterrence/ .<br>
The "no free lunch" pessimist in me harbors a nagging suspicion that that kind of nuclear deterrent world replaces many smaller risks (of conventional wars) with one big risk (of all out nuclear war) - but that's another discussion.<br>

My reading of text was more along the lines of "nuclear as defensive deterrent is complete success as no nuclear nation has been invaded", while "nuclear as offensive weapon is half successful only b/c while it slowed down western support of UKR it did not stop if completely".<br>
Heard today the argument "the whole world, including China and India - and not only he West - must help UKR deter the RUS aggressive war (invasion) from non-nuclear proliferation point of view. If RUS succeeds all nations of the world will take the lesson that they must posses nukes for deterrent".<br>

One reading of the graph: the poorest can't afford a car. The moment they stop being the poorest and can afford a car - people get a car.

It will do you good. The "object part" is silly, but the matrix engine is solid. Expressing everything as bunch of vectorised matrix operations is good for the little grey cells. The code size is x5-x7 times reduced. One downside: hard to trace a canary through a bunch of those ops to ensure correctness. Pass by value with copy-on-write is good, knowing "if vectorsied then fast" is good.<br>

Yeah - I know they are available, and have used them. Fwiw I found python pandas between silly and painful (numpy tad better). Yes - not a native type but library functions operating on an object - and it shows. Maybe b/c in matlab matrix is *the* default type - the difference seemed vast to me. Trivially, in pandas "am I modifying the existing matrix or is the changed one that is assigned to a new variable" was not blindingly obvious to me. Working with few 100s of those each weighing 40GB - one gets fed up with the uncertainty rather quickly. 😁<br>

Where about on the web interface is it?? When I don't find it, I have no way of know which of the two - (a)  the feature has not been enabled for me; or (b) I have not looked at the right place - is the case. It is kind of useful to know if it is (a) - so I stop looking, or (b) - so I keep looking.<br>

I too think Mearsheimer is wrong on UKR now, but tbf he got it right that pressurising UKR to give up on the nuclear weapons deterrent (inherited from the SU) will lead to attempt by RUS to take over UKR, ultimately by force.

All forged as nations within living memory. It shall pass. I come from a nation that is being tagged as "fake" or "artificial" even by nations that are barely 100 years "older" then mine. Most people just don't think (much). Somehow even when they accept - 1) their nation did not exist at the time of the dinosaurs; and 2) it exists now - still can't quite internalize the logical conclusion that therefore 3) their nation must have come into being sometime between 1) and 2).<br>

I fear the endpoint of this kind of crazy RUS genocidal chain of thought will be: RUS needs to turn UKR into a nuclear desert. UKR must develop nuclear deterrent in order to survive. The rest of CE Europe too. Like Israel had to in the 70s with its much bigger neighbors bent on its destruction.<br>

TBH that's "it was ever thus" (also Churchill's 10 min conversation with average constituent), probably fair to assume it's not even unique to the current moment. More interesting if one can add something actionable - what is to be done, if anything?<br>
Image description<br>
In "The Laws of Stupidity" a 4-quadrants classification of us humans is proposed, the criterion being "does my action cause good/harm +/- to me and good/harm +/- to others"? The results of my action place me in: Q1 - good/good +/+ for both I'm "intelligent", Q2 - bad for me good for others +/- I'm "helpless", Q3 - bad for me bad for others -/- I'm "stupid", Q4 - good for me bad for others +/- I'm a "bandit". Q3 "Stupid" is most dangerous b/c other's don't expect that I will cause pain for them at no personal gain for me (even maybe a small pain for me too). So they can't predict my action and prepare for the pain my action will cause them. Also b/c it is something unexpected unanticipated by other, they always under-count the number of Q3 "Stupid" members of a group.<br>

Thx - for benefit of anyone else: Reg 18 in https://legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2015/2038/contents/made references Art 21 of http://fra.europa.eu/en/eu-charter/article/21-non-discrimination where finally "... political or any other opinion" is not to be discriminated on. I had an account closed ages ago with v.little of explanation hence mild interest in.<br>

TBH relying on bottom-up tactical vote self-organization is never going to be as good as mutual "non-attacking" electoral pact (best if unwritten and tacit - like the CON-s and their competitors on the right) of not fielding competing candidates.<br>

Sure, it is possible to have conflict of interest(s). But there's a vast chasm a huge difference, between "possible" and "it did happen". Just throwing mud to see what sticks doesn't seem to me a good way to go about public discussion TBH - detracts, it's not helping.<br>

Нема бизнис за македонски железници. Односно има - против. Нема железница што може да биде рентабилна само при 2М луѓе. Може со 10М или 20М - ама при 2М луѓе, и плус сиромашни (3ти-4ти од доле - само над Молдавија, Косово, можеби Албанија) - не гледам како може да не работи со загуба. Тоа што е реално извор на корупција - служи за трансфер на плати за партиски војници - е дополнително зло.<br>

Information is the most fundamental, energy and matter are its realizations. Realizations that are discrete. Reality is N-dimensional, and as N increases the space moves in the corners (the middle is devoid of space). So the space ends up being discrete, every point an outlier.<br>

Poland+Balts are next on the firing line (after Moldova). RU can't really lose a war - only not win it - so at worst a draw for RU whatever happens (russians will be at loss but Kremlin doesn't care abt them). UA bought them time, PL should be developing its own nuclear deterrent<br>

Well - as a point of logic, it is virtually impossible to be right-done.  So it can only ever be under-done or over-done. It is under-done to start with, by default, and then as time goes on and we keep doing it, we notice it's been over-done. (ne stignalo ako ne prestignalo)<br>

Sure they did, and that is a bad thing to do. The idea is - it should not be done. There are many small states in Europe. If bigger European states start invading smaller ones to gobble them up b/c they can, it will be WW1 and WW2 all over again. The idea is to stop that.<br>

Nuclear is green . No energy == no civilisation, as simple as. Use nuclear to remove the last of coal, gas and biomass from the electrical energy supply. Then take stock, see what next. France did it with 80s technology, rest/us can do it too and better with +50yrs tech improved.<br>

True the 2nd part (ripping us off), but the 1st part (director's responsibility is max profit to s/holders) is I think an urban myth: there is no such thing in the legal documents (e.g. Companies Act 2006). The responsibilities listed are broad, and to the company, not s/holders.<br>

OFC not. They earn their living by producing words - web/paper news can't be published as empty pages. Finding and speaking truths is but an impossible task for the (old) media given its structure with commercial and time pressures, subscription favoring partisanship etc.<br>

Generalised to form vs. function. Dominants opinion is if good/bad form, then good/bad function. But there's a minority opinion that too great a form is to deceive & mask a poor function. In the extreme end - some think if poor form then great function. That seems crazy to me.<br>

My UK naturalization experience (2008) was very positive. I didn't even dislike the "Life in the UK" test for the trivia it contained (like a pub quiz) - except cramming it was a minor chore. The ceremony was lead by a Sheriff wearing robes and a gong 😁 - so that was good too.<br>

Re: other habits: employees need to jointly own the IP. The .py scripts, derived data, reports etc you generate for FT should be jointly owned by yourself too. Companies squander person-eons of work routinely b/c executives deciding barely register what a git repository is.<br>

Only their ideology is stopping them, nothing else. Existing solar firms are too weak & small, their service is bad. Solar - when a battery or inverter fails, it's weeks of calls (and this under warranty!). "Public provider of last resort" needed for electric/gas, water, trains.<br>

Nuclear risk is ever present. Everyone - incl US, RU - is always in "can negotiate" mode (regardless of the PR).  Current positions are "RU- UA (and EE) are ours to take", "US- leave UA (and EE) alone". TBH we got to this point via "do nothing" after the 2014 war, MH17, Crimea.<br>

EEurope countries need a nuclear umbrella. Without one, RU can attack them at will, safe in the knowledge that the worst outcome for RU is a draw. Maybe PL+Balts(+UA?) will have the will&means to see through to their own nuclear detterent (with all associated risks). No other way<br>

Having Abomb does not prevent that, as destroying infrastructure is not an existential threat. Having own Abomb should prevent invasion like RU invading UA, as an invasion is an existential threat. (going with the argument, even if I'm not convinced that SH settled the NS12 qn)<br>

Sure, if one looks for reasons why "Not", among the gazillion ways in which it may fail, one can find them easily. If one works on the few ways one may actually do it - then maybe it will be done. Goes back to CP Snow "The Two Cultures" and in our time the "cheems mindset" too.<br>

Alternative explanation maybe: you amass in your head so much evidence about the factual, and very little about the counterfactuals, that logically the former overwhelms the latter. Typically there will be many more counterfactual scenarios paths for every one factual.<br>

They want the passangers to wait for the plane (wasting passanger time costs 0), not for the plane to wait on the passangers (that costs them $$$). When boarding starts, the personnel can let everyone present through, close the gate (wasting 0 time) and move to the next boarding.<br>

Daft comment. Didn't see a single "wow - mmap magical compression loads 20GB weights into 6 GB RAM" take. Systems programmers for sure know how virtual memory works. Been using mmap for exactly the same use pattern - map TBs of RO data to GBs of RAM on demand - for donkeys yrs.<br>

You article is great, but I think it does not address the *existential* in the threat, ref-ed here https://twitter.com/jmkorhonen/status/1585567668681203715 . Think Israel v.s. Arab neighbour countries. It would be irrational for CEEurope to not develop a nuclear deterrent -  RUS is not going away anytime soon.<br>

From what I've gathered, Eastern Europe strongly sees war in Ukraine as near-existential. In Eastern Europe, many believe (and not without justification) that the West abandoned them in 1945. Now the threat from the East has returned. And the West seems to hesitate already.<br>

I'm antiwar. Peace to break all need to agree to it, for a war to break it suffices one side to wage it. Fear that Crimea 2014 lesson RU learned is "war works fine". RU propaganda says that what Putin thinks, and they are not shy to say what it is<br>

Yes - it's a refusal to engage, for whatever reasons. While it's unpleasant, one seeks practical solution. Passing moral judgement does not solve the problem of message-not-received. It will not make the receiver not-ridicule the accent. People'd switch off and BBC cared abt that<br>

Laugh - maybe, but not mock or hate. Avoiding the latters is his clearly articulated aim. Doesn't seem out of mind to me: if transmitting a message, chose a form that won't make the receiver turn off, solely b/c of the form, without even getting to the content of the message.<br>

They/we shouldn't, no one is pro-hate, didn't think the clip showed any. He invented a new accent, so there'd be no hating (nor mocking). So pple get the content of the message, do not switch off before merely judging the form. True this touches identity, is "least bad not ideal"<br>

At least it gets people to 1) acknowledge priors exist 2) articulate those priors. Loads of people are articulate, erudite and persuasive, while being illogical (admit one can't hope many to be numerate too). So formalizing the reasoning process a bit is not the worst of starts.<br>

Then address the point he is making. Say US leaves UA to be eaten by RU. That gives an idea to RU that US will do the same with PL too. After all - there is some history to that. So RU invades PL. Bad call! (like "Kyiv in 1 week") US responds, not allowing RU to eat PL - Aboom!<br>

The risk is not 0 even if USA leaves UKR to be eaten by RUS. Putin/RUS take home message will be "US/NATO weak => invade Balts/Poland". in 2030 RUS invades Poland, and *then* we get the thermonuclear war. That cost of inaction has been increasing since 2014, and will continue to.<br>

SRB Milosevic declared a victory in accepting the Kumanovo agreement in 1999 ending the Kosovo war. Putin with the PR technologists & media under control could do similar. He is in a much stronger position though - with nuclear deterrent and RUS not under threat - so prob won't.<br>

If all states had nuclear weapons, would aggressive wars between states stop? Will that be an universal deterrent? The other risks (accident, crazy, end-of-world-death-cult etc) of nuclear Armageddon would shoot up. But would aggressive wars like state X invades state Y stop?<br>

I think you are right. Seems in a war between a nuke and a non-nuke state, one needs to level the field to decrease the probability of a nuke use. And only way available is - make the non-nuke side a nuke one. Ergo - give nukes to UKR, to decrease the risk of RUS using theirs.<br>

Yes, but: the risk does not decrease if NATO leaves UA to be eaten by RU. Putin's take home message be "NATO weak => invade Poland", in 10yrs attacks Poland, and *then* we get the thermonuclear war. Already mentioned in the thread: give UKR nuclear weapons. (they had nukes once)<br>

Thanks! Is it 1) "fixed" supply (nuclear, some gas) pre-ordered, price fixed, pre-paid is not part of the rolling auction; leaving the 2) "variable" supply (to match variable demand) to participate. And for that portion wind supplied enough Quantity to be a Price setter. Nice. 😀<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
Wind is the marginal price setter?? That implies 1) wind more expensive than gas & nuclear, or 2) 100% of the demand is supplied by cheap sources (solar, wind) - but the figure is 60%, not 100. I see gas & nuclear supply 15-20%, expect them more expensive => marginal prc setters.<br>

Yes - a population usually believes what the TV box tells them. It is easier that way to function in a society. If/when the TV-voice contradicts my lived experience, then I may start to question the TV-voice. Even then - there are many excuses available. C.f. media technologists.<br>

Your argument holds if founders are rational and do expected value calculations. But if they were, they'd never attempt a startup, as the overwhelming odds are a startup will fail. In expectation, they'd be better off getting a day job at BigTechCorp & living a moderated life.<br>

Yes - a counter-counter the extreme bonds liquidity: the interest on my NS&I bonds motivates me a bit to keep NS&I, and not convert into a new car. Would think ok to pay interest if one is locked - for 1-2-5-10yrs - into the bond unable to sell till maturity. Delaying consumption<br>

Pacifism - confuses the ends with the means. The end aim is peace. But the means to achieve peace are not: put your hands up. Realism - in short is "might is right". The less said about those espousing it, the better. We have to put up with both, but it's good to challenge them.<br>

Well noticed @psiphi_gavagai : we have access to the same natural resources that e.g. neolithic people had. What makes for the difference in outcomes is the *knowledge* we have, that neolithic people lacked.<br>

Notice in the graph the countries that dominate science and technology are at the top. Compare it with countries that have the most oil reserves. Oil by itself is useless without human ingenuity to effectively utilize it.<br>

Uh-oh - market design from an ivory tower. Price Inf-ifinity is possible => will happen given electricity is like O2. Market participants can implicitly collude - a wind farm forecasts demand, bids 90%, leaves 10% to the gas plant to lift the final price.<br>

Alleviate *now* - agree now's too late. Energy market design lead us to this point,  fair to admit. Don't think a magic to solve the problem now exists. The prior 30+ years though - that's a different matter, there was time. We've come long way from "system good, world at fault".<br>

Eh - "unforeseen", "shock" - that's weak. A good pricing model would've taken into account  "energy is like oxygen, P-rice will go to Inf-inity well before Q-uantity drops b/c Q can never be 0". Price-in the Inf-P risk during good times of low-P, stimulate supply, build up Q etc.<br>

Agree on the rationing by price or blackouts. Don't agree "does not stem from pricing". If  the pricing algo was "good", it would have lead to ample supply in the previous 30+ years of application, no? Just not that plausible - "model good/ perfect, reality bad", is it?<br>

Yes. So now the issue becomes what "insight" means to each of us. If I hand-wave-y "explain" how a car works, is that "insight"? Or maybe I need to build a car myself, to prove I have gained "insight"? Or both? We very soon come to epistemology and what does it mean to know etc.<br>

Member of an UN task force - I would not expect them to say anything as divisive or contested as that. Imho they are super-scrupulous in avoiding causing any offense to any side, as they rely on all sides' cooperation to do their job. Seen plenty of that in ex-YU wars.<br>

It's not the job of this UN task force to inform us. They have a narrow and specific task, and are usually scrupulous in sticking to it (for good reasons imho). To me the A sounded like the blandest of bland "thank you all" to a mildly provocative Q by a journo fishing for info.<br>

True. Plus other factors - GFC'08 loomed large, Murdoch turned against Brown (backed Cameron), Campbell was less powerful in keeping the press pack in check.  RU supporting random fringe groups - it was always thus, e.g. SU supported range of green, environmental, anti-nuclear.<br>

Debunking a lie takes ~x10 times more effort than generating one. If one were to investigate every lie RU-prop generates, there'd be little time for anything else. So we form priors:  if someone blatantly lies 99% of the time, then by default to start with I assume "it's a lie".<br>

Alas - that is not the case. The laws of nature (say - physics) are such that the 10 neighbors will subdue me, take my property and leave me with nothing. That is the law of nature. And that is what happens in animal groups of all sorts. One - alpha, usually male - has it all 2/6<br>

So property rights - like human rights - are un-natural, something we groups of humans agree on, against nature and physics, b/c they are good for every 1 individual, and are good for the group too (on average, all other things being equal, etc etc) 3/6<br>

This hinges on defining "knowledge" as the negative entropy of the probability distribution. If the distribution is flat => we know little as everything is eqly likely to happen. If the the distribution has a single spike => we know a lot, the spiky thing is likely to happen. 4/4<br>

... but allowing RUS to gobble up EEurope may end up with nuclear miscalculation. Last time 1939-41 that happened (sans nuclear). And prior "let strong eat weak states" period was 1914-18. One could argue: keeping UKR strong and resisting RUS is reducing nuclear risk.<br>

• This coincides with a steady and ongoing positive trend in views towards immigrants<br>
• But renewed tabloid focus on immigration could change things<br>

Во Харпенден застанувам и ги пропуштам. Во Скопје ми е страв: на булевар се вози 100кмнч (Харпенден 35кмнч), и 1) на другите ленти колите ќе ги убијат 2) мене ќе ме чукнат од назад. Културата е социјална: никој не очекува да застанам (вкл. ни пешаците), правам хаос ако застанам.<br>

No one claims otherwise, or anything really about information and knowledge. I'm aware that information (data) and knowledge (outcomes p.d.f. shape) are related. Indeed additional information (data) can decrease our knowledge/increase our uncertainty (entropy) about an outcome.<br>

You're underestimating XR. The policies are self-fulfilling: if implement a tiny sliver of it, that then brings the catastrophe forecast. That is taken as confirmation "we're right". Next step then is "not enough policy was done, need more", and like that in a +ve feedback loop.<br>

They predicted "if R=X then admissions=Y". Plugin the current R, e.g. R=0.9 (https://gov.uk/guidance/the-r-value-and-growth-rate#history) into their model, produce a line+cloud (probably will be under the green one). The experts claim is: the real observed admissions will be in that cloud, 95 out of 100 times.<br>

R is input to the model, not a prediction. They predict "IF R=X THEN admissions=Y". Plugin the current R=0.9 into the model, produce line+cloud (will prob be under the greens). Their claim is: the observed admissions will be in the cloud, 95/100. Likely to be right, eyeballing.<br>

That model does not claim to predict R. The model claims "if you keep R at so-and-so, this is going to happen with the hospital admissions going forward in time". We judge models on what they claim, not what they don't. The prediction is "if X then Y" and that they do ok.<br>

Good interview, naive thinking. Quants *and* poets synthesis is possible & being forged atm. The world around is mysterious enough, no need for extra-mystery of hobbit land. His road will likely lead him to neo-reactionary monarchy+feudalism. Orthodoxy+withdrawal cf. @roddreher<br>

Disappointing but such is the nature of research ("90% of great scientists start as heretics; the problem is that 90% of scientific heretics are talking nonsense").

The fear will likely amount to nothing, and like with the previous dozen inflation forecasts/scares, it will not happen. The Fed and ECB forecasts have been wrong for the 2nd decade now, but the cretins producing them are paid too well to give up the terrible forecasting - e.g: Image Fed-ECB-inflation-forecasts.png<br>

[[[ In other words, a nation consists of people who feel they have enough in common with each other to accept being ruled by a government elected by a majority of them. By that definition, Scotland is a nation; even those who want Scotland to remained in the UK accept the legitimacy of the Scotish government. But Northern Ireland isn't: Protestant Unionists and Catholic Nationalists consider themselves so different that they accept only to share power, not to be ruled by a majority of the people of Northern Ireland. ]]]<br>

But that's exactly wrong - no? An effect can be "statistically significant" while being "insubstantial, immaterial, trivial" - bacause the size of the effect is small. We are just very certain it is not zero. The size may be 1e-38 for all we care, we'll still say "significant".

Не мислам дека „со принтање пари проблемот е решен". Не нагаѓај што мислам, читај што пишувам. Со кратење на јавниот сектор проблемот се дуплира, не се преполовува. Државата има можност (и обврска!) да му помогне на приватниот сектор. Со оваа мерка му одмага.<br>

Ќе смениш навики, ќе престанеш да купуваш, на тие од кои купуваш, и ним ќе им секне платата. Твојата потрошувачка беше нивни проход. Заедно сте! Ако тебе ти е лошо, и на нив ќе им биде лошо. Гледај тебе да ти биде подобро, и нив ќе им биде подобро.<br>

Еве прилика „реалниот" сектор да блесне, да се справи со вирусов, да не спаси злото. Ајде, што чека, голот е отворен. Нека организира и одбрана и напад. „Реалниот" во наводници - пошто админстрација, полиција, војска, лекари, учители, и те како се реални. До '45-та ги немавме.<br>

<br>Тоа што ти ќе бидеш на минималец, нема никому да помогне, а на многу ќе одмогне. Прво на тебе. А после и на сите фирми на кои ти си муштерија. На кои ти им даваш плата со твоето трошење. И тие ќе пропаднат.<br>

На твојата фирма треба владата да помогне, да плати платите на работниците (привремено), ја ослободи фирмата од данок, да даде кредит за да не пропадне (како во DE FR UK). На комшијата ако му умре козата, нема тебе да ти се роди. Ако тие пропаднат, и ти ќе пропаднеш, заедно сте.<br>

Точно така. Ова мерка не му помага на приватниот сектор. Напротив, многу му одмага. Утре тие буџетари што паднаа на минималец, нема да купат роба. Приватникот што ја прави таа роба нема да ја продаде. Приватникот ќе пропадне. И така во круг.<br>

Ова е неписмена и погрешна мерка. Не да измислуваме топла вода сега. Да гледаме што прават Германија, Франција, Британија... Никој ваква мерка не донесе. Напротив, сите пумпаат пари во економијата, преку државно трошење. Државниот сектор преку трошење го држи во живот приватниот!<br>

Приватникот кој ја прави таа храна, кога ке продаде 70  леба (наместо 100 досега), во следната тура ќе направи 70. Без везе е да прави 100, кога 30 фрлил, никој не му ги купи.<br>
Се што треба да направи владата е да им ги покрие платите на приватните работници (привремено).<br>

Of course not, the vast majority do not. We could end homeless tomorrow, by building homes and gifting them to the homeless. Admit 1-10% may be on the street again in ~1 year. That's ok, we reduced the problem x10-100 times. We lack the nerve & will to do it. As simple as that.<br>

"EEC proved more successful economically than Britain had anticipated. From 1961 to 1974, GDP per capita grew by 215% in the EEC to just 88% in Britain... In 1962, 1st time since the War, Britain traded more with Western Europe than with the Commonwealth" http://gladstonediaries.blogspot.com/2020/01/brexit-in-historical-perspective-age-of.html<br>

Not a secret that. From the horse's mouth: "I know a lot of Tory MPs and I am sad to say - the public is basically correct. Tory MPs, largely, do not care about these poor people, they don't care about the NHS, and the public kind of has caught onto that." https://youtube.com/watch?v=CDbRxH9Kiy4&t=30m35s<br>

We use infrastructure Victorians built. They were poorer, fewer than us, had worse machinery. Let's keep our nerve. Costs/time are somewhat underestimated, but so are gains and by an order of magnitude. One new commute town on the track will more than pay for it (@rorysutherland)<br>

Exactly that: when Roman's beancounters forecast the cost (stone, labour, etc) of A1 they were about right. But they could not foresee many centuries latter the growth A1 generated in Hatfield, Welwyn, Stevenage, Hitchin, Letchworth, etc. They were off by orders of magnitude.<br>

It is still the best use of 18yr old's time. The debt is more like graduate tax. It should not be dismantled but adapted to the changed world: online, part time, 1or2 yr courses, older students. The subsidy is not a bug but a feature! Imagine  the northern towns sans their unis.<br>

Not a scam, "debt" is more like graduate tax, should not be dismantled but adapted to future needs (online, part time, 1or2 yr courses, older students). Agreed Re: subsudy, but that is a good thing (feature, not a bug). UK is a world leader in HighEd, well better than expected.<br>

IDK why Social Media companies refuse to implement flags 1) real human (but not the name) 2) real human AND real name. Paid by us users as one-off fee. I'd pay $99 one-off, iif I had tools to filter posts and or accounts on - 1-yes/no, 2-yes/no. Wd have thought SocMedCos wd jump on the opportunity?<br>

...even if 10yrs late. But didn't see why LAB will work where CON failed. Policies are v.similar. Tempting to think "LAB are better people" but I doubt it makes a diff. E.g. LH is fail affecting 5M where it cd have been a win.<br>

ta- IDK enough to judge. Seems relevant Qs abt any sub-units are 1) can they support enough scale in projects 2) can then meaningfully compete with each other 3) can they raise revenue on their own. Ideally £££ incentives would be: +ve for doing, -ve for not doing stuff. May need bigger >500K units.<br>

Prob it doesn't help that Treasury incentives are skewed. Financial stability trumps risks not-taken but need for growth. At this point the system is so centralised, that it'd be a brake even wh more grwth skewed incentives. Only decentralisation+incentives change at lower levels can move things now<br>

It helps to stay away from flowery language & stick to basics. Intellectual Property exists in human law, not in natural law. Me copying your words does not deprive you of them. I don't want kids imprisoned for sharing a pic. If the pic author doesn't want it copied don't publish it on the Internet<br>

Might equally say - tragedy of the commons exists b/c of pple like his detractors. Internet is built on open free software. All protocols, most software, certainly GNU/Linux that most  servers run. All built by pple delighted to have their codes copied, and detested enclosure enough to invent GPL.<br>

We have had abt 1.2C warming in the last 100 years - right? We got some idea by now of how big a problem it is, and what can we realistically do. Always puzzled what advocates messaging "we are doomed, doomed" hope to achieve with the message. Surely the rational answer to that msg is "do nothing"??<br>

What's your opinion on the build-build-build movement? Does it have any basis in reality? Their impression/assumption is "nothing gets built, we are in paralisis in a stasis". And they blame the administrative state for this. I'm in the UK, and something similar is brewing here too.<br>

Why surprise? They were built as "the best model of us we can build". To the extent we discover in them, things we know of the human brain - the build up suceeds (or fails). Has implications for non-human intelligences of animals, plants, tissues, cells etc. That seems very important but overlooked.<br>

I block on 1st bad interaction, block back when blocked. If I 'm reading passively & don't want to ever read again, I try guess "why am I being shown this" & act more upstream. So not to have to whack one by one downstream. Failing that - mute (not block) downstream. Lists - no, I don't use them.<br>

Polling data. The French whale who bet big on DT, did so only after commissioning and paying for his own polls.

Usual talk is of leveling the power imbalance by decreasing #3. I prefer increasing #1 and #2. Advanced societies need more info for more cooperation.<br>

Sky Follower Bridge helped me re-create my social graph Follows-Followers partially. It's the social graph, much more than the old posted content, that keeps us users in the walled garden. Ideally the graph would be portable, belong to the user not the network. But - TBD.<br>

FF "Sky Follower Bridge" is the best! 😍 It works on List members too. In your X list, open the panel listing List members, activate "Sky Follower Bridge", click "Find Bluesky Users". Where it finds the X accounts over at Bsky, click "Follow on Bluesky". 🤩 (guide at www.wikihow.com/Import-Twitt...)<br>

It's a cycle of enshitification. Platform good=>users come=>create value=>adverts are sold=>good $$ business=>sold to new owners=>ROI sweat the asset=>platform deteriorates. Have your social graph follows-followers replicated to other platforms, and half the effort to breaking free is done.<br>

Interesting to learn that most people don't create an account in any and all platforms, just in case, even as a dormant one, even if it's free, after the initial create effort also does not tax my time or attention.

No need to put up with cr*p for any length of time when good alternatives exist, and they are free. DDG worked well for me for 2yrs, now perplexity.ai is my default.

That's 500 out of possible 5000 to be shown, and 4500 to not be shown. The feed must decide which 500, out of 5000 possible, to show me. And conversely, 4500 to not show me.

Agree 100%. To that - "What is to be done now?" My 2p: UK gov ultra centralized in Whitehall (#1) (almost Stalinist), then that centralized power is further held in a strangle hold by the Treasury Brain-Deep State-OBR complex (#2). Together Centralisation^2. Change needs to act on #1 &| #2 points.<br>

FDA prevarication is incomprehensible unconsolable. Us 2 are in charge of approving a life saving drug. Every day 1 person dies. We organise a final approval meeting. Schedule it 10 days from now rather than today=>we just killed 10 pple that didn't need to die<br>

Reminds me of the "Nothing Is True and Everything Is Possible: The Surreal Heart of the New Russia" book by Peter Pomerantsev (2014). Not so much to construct a lie, but by "flooding the field with shit" to deny the possibility of any definite truth (and reality). "Political technologists" at work.<br>

The laws you cite without citing are human laws, not natural laws. Humans agreed on copyright - i.e. forbade other people copying your art, for reasons - they can equally agree to scrap those laws and allow such copying. May seem bad or unfair to you and me - but it is wholy within their rights.<br>

Good on you. I don't particularly mind who builds - just that it's built. Is it the case that on one hand councils must provide housing, while on the other hand, they're forbidden to build housing - and both by law? That strikes me as crazy, schizophrenic state of affairs. Any chance of change soon?<br>

I login, the algofeed serves 50 posts on one screen full. I check the feed 10 times per day = 500 posts shown to me daily. That is 500 out of possible 5000 to be shown, and 4500 to not be shown. Algofeed must decide which 500, out of 5000 possible, to show me. 2/<br>

Nope, it's too much of "they are both the same" tbh. Because they are not the same. One side is aggressor, on offense, the other side is defending. One side can stop fighting, collect their soldiers, go home, no problem all good. If the other side stops fighting, they are dead, destroyed utterly. so<br>

Hard to defend intellectually that. This is more defensible though: X is a choke point, in @pluralistic.net.web.brid.gy book sense. So it's right and proper to reduce that choke, by having a budding competitor (in stand by even if not competing actively). Anti-monopoly laws are useful precedent.<br>

Is there any research on the minimal number of bad apples or quantity of badness that suffice to spoil the barrell? And cause community disintegration? In online communities or IRL communes or group games etc. Intuitive feel I have is 1-2%. Would love to find any quantitive research on that.<br>

Human drivers kill about 30K people on the US roads every year. On a bicycle sharing the road with cars - I'd feel much safer with a robot car than a human driver. Robocar actually obeys the rules about speed and distance when overtaking me. I'd trust my kid being driven to school in a robocar.<br>

Manually unfortunately :-( Found it just about bearable for 3K follows + 3K followers. Good things - can be applied to any of the lists (did "Following", "Verified Followers", "Followers"), one can start from the middle, and one can scroll with the wheel while the tool fetching data so goes faster.<br>

Hope that makes the switch non-reversible. The iron law of social anything: single public square, with connections scaling with the square (N^2) of the participants number (N), will have advantage over incumbent. The value of a network is in the connections, they grow quadratically with the user base.<br>

IDK TBS :-) There is strong positive feedback loop in all things social, including economy. The default is "to whom that has, more shall be given". Explicit example is interest on savings (distributed by a Central Bank). But exists in business as well - there's natural tendency towards monopoly.<br>

Have fallen back to a pedestrian alternative: look through tweets written abt weekly, select few, copy&paste url+text in a logBook txt file under git. 😊<br>

My reading is: initially size was necessary given the lack of sufficient compute, lack of large quantity and good quality data. Now with improvements on all axis - ever more compute, more and better data, they manage to squeeze much much more in the weights. Excellent news indeed. :-)<br>

... don't share his doomerism because imo us humans are again making the error of projecting ourselves - the worst of us in this case - to alien entities. When us humans are destroyed it will be by us humans, or some asteroid type event - but not by AIs.<br>

Like the argument, in an ideal world we'd band together do it.<br>
In this world, best I see is massively improve indoors air quality with campaign of installing air purifiers, cleaners etc in all public spaces where groups of pple spend time. Individually - home office CO2 showing gizmo an eye opener.<br>

Econ incentives oft get a mention, but what's offered as compensation is imo minuscule compared to the real *opportunity* cost to the middle class parents (==most people in the industrialized societies). We had kids when it was worth it to us, and now we don't have them anymore for the same reason.<br>

How I lost trust in scientists<br>
🤓 Check out my new quiz app ➜  http://quizwithit.com/  You all know that I am critical of some developments in physics and tech. I believe it is for this reason that I get a lot of comments of the sort "I am so disappointed in you that you fell for the climate hoax, I thought you are a sceptic".  In this video, I want to explain how my experience in physics had me lose trust in scientists, and that indeed I was highly sceptical of climate change a decade ago. I looked at the science -- and scientists -- very closely. Unfortunately it turned out that climate change is not a hoax.  #science<br>

Very good. Science used to be a cottage industry. Its practices match(ed) that. But it's changed & is now Big industry. So the practices will be evolve accordingly. Closest I see to BigSci direction of travel is the Free Software imo: all in the open, by default. And that's a great thing 😊<br>

I wonder if it's going to be offered to pre-diabetics too? Or even for people to buy the stuff private? Pple in UK pay £300 pcm for Wegovy or Mounjaro. Surely this is cheaper?<br>
