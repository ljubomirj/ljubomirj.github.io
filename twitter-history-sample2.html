On the sins of commission versus omission, this-<br>
https://x.com/dmitri_dolgov/status/1930337733719011608<br>
A robot car video of a child, running after a dog, running after a ball, running in front of a car, in the darkness of the night. If this was a human driver, they would have run over the dog and the child likely. They Weymo robot car stopped in time. Potentially some lives saved there.<br>
How are ok with a human driver killing that child there, cutting their life short, scarring for life everyone that knew them, ruining the remainder of the lives of their parents. And for what?? To tend to our &quot;yuck reflex&quot; factor we humans exhibit as a 1st reaction, with anything new out whack with our prior experience? How can anyone justify that??<br>
I remember in my childhood, the wide spread revulsion and scary newspapers and TV headlines, when the first IVF child was born. They were labelled &quot;kids from/of/by eprouvette&quot; by the press - as if grown in glass jars?? (and not merely allowing two cells to join outside of human body; an unremarkable event) The current AI scaremongering, recalls for me memories of the scary headlines, of the &quot;Frankenstein children&quot;, that were going to be bad for them, but also bad to the rest of us humans somehow. Even if it was never quite articulated - only ever insinuated - the mechanism by which those terrible outcomes will meterialise. Fast forward 45yrs, 2.5% of babies in the US are born by IVF, and... - nothing! A nothing-burger. No one thinks much of it, all&apos;s fine.<br>

https://youtube.com/watch?v=7oAlD3lMNXo<br>
I wish they had more time, and that the interviewer had been more interactive, asking follow-up questions. Several times Ray dropped absolute bombshells, and yet the interviewer just... moved on?? No deeper inquiry, as if he missed the magnitude of what we’d just heard. Like the artificial kidney that could potentially save 95,000 people each year who currently can’t get transplants. Or Waymo cars, now driving autonomously for months without killing anyone—even as human drivers might have caused around 50,000 deaths on US roads over a comparable timeframe (though admittedly over more total miles driven).<br>
The interviewer was otherwise excellent, but that particular lack of curiosity surprised me—so much so that it stuck in my mind. Maybe if we had accepted a robot driver earlier, even at the likely cost of perhaps 100 lives, we could have saved as many as half a million lives over a decade. Wouldn&apos;t we, as a society, have accepted those odds? Isn&apos;t it ethically clearer that killing 100 people through commission (robotic error) is significantly less morally troubling than allowing half a million deaths through omission (human driver error)?<br>
I find this lack of statistical compassion stunning. As if we’re incapable of counting—or as if our moral instincts haven&apos;t caught up to reality. Perhaps Ray’s hopeful message &quot;Love is all you need&quot; might truly resonate and succeed in the AI age, where it fell short in the pre-AI age? TBS stay tuned - time will tell.<br>

Sacks, bags filled with fluid, for growing babies outside human body, will solve that sooner rather than latter. So we relieve half of our whole species (the woman-folk half) of the barbaric practice of carrying in their belly a growing human for 9 months. (not unlike Alien as per the infamous movie.)<br>
I&apos;m sorry to notice, but I really suspect this: if man-folk half of the species had to push out an object the size of a ball, from one of our orifices, while screaming in pain—well. Suspect this would have been achieved done already. Another black mark on humanity lacking compassion for the other. Still—better sooner than never.<br>

I thought it was great, spirited and even funny at times. 😅 How he got fired on the spot by the general-boss-of-his-general-boss was a gem I thought. 🤣<br>
The bits on quant trading are spot on afaics. Having some experience there myself - he&apos;s not mystifying it, (that many do to my surprise; for reason unclear to me  perpetuate the &quot;those who speak don&apos;t know; those who know don&apos;t speak&quot; bizarre omertà in the field; like - if you want to keep things secret, then just say nothing, don&apos;t B/S people) and in fact telling it like it is. Not one silver bullet, but a giant machine of 1000 smaller parts, each part polished to great precision in exquisite detail with tons of manual R&amp;D.<br>
