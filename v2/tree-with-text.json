    "text": "# Why Write\n\nQ: Why write in public when you can write in private?\n\nA: Yes I have a plain text file \\~/logBook for simple note taking. That just works, no fuss.\\\nI do minimal extra work to have it versioned in \\$HOME/.git, and structured in sections FIXME / TODO / DONE / DONTDO.\n\nHowever. I catch myself bothering people close to me, family and friends, with things I find interesting to talk about and or discuss, that they find less interesting even boring. :-)\n\nSo these home pages are written is to take those themes out of my system, while not bothering any of the above mentioned. Only people to read will be online randoms that stumble on this by their own volition - so fine.\n\nQ: Why not use social media, social networks?\n\nA: Yes I do use social networks - most often X [\\@ljupc0](https://x.com/ljupc0), sometimes Bsky [\\@ljupco.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/ljupco.bsky.social), rarely Mastodon [\\@ljupco](https://mstdn.io/@ljupco), and lately I even typed couple of \\\"Old Man Shouts at the Sky\\\" rants on Substack [\\@ljubomirjosifovski](https://substack.com/@ljubomirjosifovski/posts) to get them out of my system.\n\nThere is tons of interesting stuff there, mostly on X due to its user size and \\\"the Iron Law of public N\\^2 square\\\". I post there, but it seems mostly replies and comments to what other post. Rarely I have something super interesting and urgent that I want to communicate to the world by having the algofeed stuff it into people\\'s timelines.\n\nThen while doom scrolling I stumbled upon -\n\n` `[`https://x.com/CJHandmer/status/1839816029473779775`](https://x.com/CJHandmer/status/1839816029473779775)` `[`Casey Handmer`](https://www.caseyhandmer.com/)`, PhD `[`@CJHandmer`](https://x.com/CJHandmer/)` This is your periodic reminder that you should write a blog. It doesn't have to be fancy, it doesn't have to be well-edited. It just has to be something you can cumulatively add to over time. It's easiest to write about stuff you like, and ignore your non-existent audience. 12:54 AM · Sep 28, 2024 `\n\nMy initial thoughts were [sceptical still](#){onclick=\"toggleShowImage('even-so-ees')\"} - why do it, when there are\n\n![](even-so-ees.jpeg){#even-so-ees style=\"display: none; width: 100%; height: auto;\" onclick=\"zoomImage(this)\"}\n\na.  logBook for things private;\nb.  X/Bsky/\\... for things public; and even\nc.  ChatGPT when audience of \\>1 is needed, while not exactly needing to broadcast to the whole wide world.\n\nBut then I\\'ve come around! I\\'ve learned to like ethese pages, my online \\$HOME in the cyberspace. :-) In addition to them being useful in laying ideas to rest, and moving on. Being bothered for a period of time by the same ideas makes for a boring living. Writing it down here in multiple versions and longer form that can be come back to, add to, revisit old - I like that. It\\'s not one-off, fire-and-forget of online quick paced quanta of ideas. I can only ever hold limited number of ideas in my head at the same time, and not juggle them for long before they crash and are forgotten. This goes towards ensuring 1) they are not lost, \\\"like tears in the the rain\\\"; and 2) can be turned over faster, juggle different balls up there. :-)\n\nFurther - it\\'s not only \\\"unload to writing so my head can fill up again\\\". The act of formulating ones maybe vague thoughts and ideas, contributes to their formation. It\\'s not like that what I say, exists inside me fully formed prior. And now I just broadcast it to the world. No - until we communicate out clearly, ideas we communicate are not fully formed. The process of communication contributes meaningfully to the process of creation, is part of it.\n\nFurther, with making them public, there will be other people around, that may read, and come back to push back and even judge me! So there is an aspect of Bet-On-It, take some risk, (even if a tiny risk), or being criticised, or even ridiculed. Concentrates the mind. Motivates the self to some self-discipline. A bit of QC - Quality Control not the worst thing to expose oneself willingly. Most thoughts I have, as with most of us humans - are ofc rubbish, better forgotten.\n\nSince starting this, I came across [Simon Willison's blog](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/) -\\\n\\\n*\\\"You should start a blog. Having your own little corner of the internet is good for the soul!\\\"*\\\n\\\n\\...and now I think there is truth in that.\n\nAnother \\\"please do write - it\\'s worth it to you and us too\\\" [Why write a blog at all?](https://substack.com/inbox/post/145980491) by [Adam Singer](https://x.com/AdamSinger) since articulates it better than I ever could myself.\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\--\\\nLJ HPD Sun 6 Oct 22:50:39 BST 2024\n:::\n\n\n<!-- source: post-my-HOME.html -->\n::: {#content}",

    "text": "# My computer \\$HOME\n\nI spend most of my time typing into a computer, reading on the computer screen, watching videos or listening to audio playing on a computer, talking and seeing other people through a computer screen. I mostly live in the text world of a terminal [emulator](https://gnome-terminator.org/), [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) command line and the [vim editor](https://www.vim.org/), with [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/) and [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/) windows into the world.\n\nNowadays I use [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org) [LTS](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle), on the desktop and on my laptops. I update every 3-4 years to the new version, but other than that - it\\'s completely uneventful. The [Xfce](https://www.xfce.org) GUI changes only slowly if ever - and that\\'s how I like it.\n\nOn the computers used by rest of the family I put Ubuntu as it\\'s better looking. They also use Windows desktops and Macbooks for laptops. The Macbooks with the M1-M4 ARM CPU-s have spectacular battery life in addition to great screens. I am looking forward to the day when I add an [ARM Thinkpad](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/arm-thinkpads-wtf0g0o0REahidqJVzJs5w#0) to my daily use. Have couple of [Thinkpads](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad) for the RAM I need. Initially I had 32GB, but now that has grown to 64GB. Can\\'t imagine to have less and would like to move to 128GB on the laptop. Have had that much on the desktop for 10 years now. That\\'s my first need: get as much RAM as I can. And the 2nd - get as fast an SSD and better NVME as I can. My daily job involves lots of data, and keeping all data needed in memory is the best UI for me. And when not in memory - then on ssd drives and preferably nvme ones.\n\nWith the advent of local LLM-s caught the bug with [LocalLLama](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/)-s. So I finally got myself a 2nd hand (thaks [Hoxton Macs](https://www.hoxtonmacs.co.uk)!) M2 mbp wth 96gb (V)RAM. And it\\'s glorious! :-) Love it - the battery life, the screen, but most of all - running local models has been a blast. With [brew](https://brew.sh/) - everything on the command line \\\"just works\\\". I get to run tons of local models, mostly [GGUF](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/gguf)-s off [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/models), used with [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) and [LMStuidio](https://lmstudio.ai/). In addition, have been gorging on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org) [ML/AI](https://arxiv.org/list/stat.ML/recent) papers and [github](https://github.com) [code](https://github.com/ljubomirj) for a year now - and I\\'m still smiling. 😊 This is the best of computers and computing! 🥰\n\nDaily I live in bash and vim mostly inside screen (the multiplexer) inside terminator (the terminal emulator). I use the shell tools, incl awk (that I like) and the rest of the gnu shell tools (grep, sed), git, gcc and g++, make, ssh, rsync, rcopy, Spyder, python, [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) with [Cline](https://cline.bot) and [Roo](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code) AI-s, Firefox, Thunderbird, Chrome, Edge, Double commander, Evince, VLC player. I like them all - my life would be worse if these free software tools didn\\'t exist. Thank you [GNU](https://www.gnu.org) [software](https://www.gnu.org/software/software.en.html), thank you [Linux](https://www.linuxfoundation.org), thank you [FSF](https://www.fsf.org).\n\nLately I\\'ve been having [codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) and [gemini](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) CLI-s to write lots of code for me, mostly my python, javascript and style-sheets html. They are very good at it! In fact *\\$ codex -m gpt-5 -c model_reasoning_effort=\\\"high\\\"* is excellent in achieving anything complicated involving the command line: I command codex-gpt-5-high, and it commands the shell. As far as l\\'m concerned - my AGI has arrived. 🤯 This is the ghost in the machine - manifest!\n\nIn my daily job I used to write quant trading systems and frameworks. But nowadays I\\'m all-in back to ML/AI, catching up with everything going on. I use a mix of C/C++, Matlab in the past now octave and python with numpy (and pandas), scripting in bash, awk, plotting in gnuplot, data fetching in sql, kdb.\n\nEverything that I do more then few times on the command line, I \\\"can\\\" it into a bash alias or function, and put in my .bashrc. In part to document and not forget. I love that command search works, I can type \\$ xyz then press (TAB) and bash will seek to complete for commands starting with xyz. And bash will keep cycling through the completions for as long as I keep pressing the (TAB) key.\n\nI keep my dot rc files under git and that\\'s worked without fuss. Looks like this:",

The 1st home computer I saw was ZX-Spectrum 16K that my school [friend](https://www.youtube.com/@AlojzRop) got before me in the last year in elementary school probably 1982-83. Remember the prices still: ZX-Spectrum 16K was £100, 48K model was £130. Commodore C64 was £200. Latter I managed to persuade my parents to buy me a C64 probably around 1985.

Each account writes about 1 post a day = 5000 posts a day. Every time I login to X and check X for new posts, the X algofeed serves me 50 posts on one screenful. I check X 10 times per day, 10 times x 50 posts per a screenful = 500 posts that X will show me daily. That is 500 posts, out of the total of 5000 eligible posts that can be shown. The other 4500 eligible posts will not be shown. X must decide which 500, out of 5000 eligible, to show me. Any one post has probability 0.1 to be shown. I expect to see 1 post from 1 account once in 10 days. X algo is non-random and tilts towards factors like accounts interaction (e.g. bio check), engagement with posts {Like,Forward,Quote,Reply}, time of posting. With the timeliness of all these factors is decayed by some half-life (from the event time to now). I presume the most important meta-data is (a) connection (follow/s/er); and (b) timeliness, time of viewing minus time of posting (that decays quickly).",

So afaik the Algofeed has meta-data only to go on, when deciding which post to push onto millions of user screens. I thought by now with all the LLM-s (and DNN-s before) posts and accounts would have been judged by the content much much more, even if with a single word2vec type vector. And that the Algofeed would take that into account. But I have not seen anything to indicate that there is any content processing.\n\nAlgofeed using meta-data mostly strikes me as being \\\"judged on the color of your skin\\\" phase of the Social Network-s, and would be good to transition to \\\"judged on the content of the character\\\", of each and every one of the posts. (and downstream - users)\n\nThere\\'s is no censorship involved - I can go to every one of those 4500 accounts home pages, and read every one of those 4500 posts.\\\nThere\\'s no moderation - those 4500 posts are perfectly fine.\\\nThey are not even totally suppressed - another user may have his 500 shown posts come from the 4500 not shown to me.

There is not a moment that we the users don\\'t get the algofeed doing something for us. I read people write \\\"I don\\'t want no algorithmic feed. Just give me the posts of users I follow in reverse time order\\\". Well - you just described a specific algorithmic feed. (aside: I do want that feed too, sometimes. There is no reason why us users can\\'t have the choice of 1000s of Feeds. To some extent that happens on Bsky; that is afaics the only remotely plausible X/Twitter competitor atm).",

The algofeed deciding which 500 posts I see today out of smaller selection of 5000 (out of total of 1B possible per day) is an editor (even if automated), and X is a publisher (even if automated). The users are readers are also writers creating content without commission or pay. I don\\'t see how X (and FB, TikTok etc) are not media companies (as opposed to - a point to point carrier of signals). They are even selling and living off adverts! :-) (mostly; X not so much nowadays) This idea is unlikely to be accepted easily. I also like to have the freedom to find all manner of crazy insane untrue stuff online. I defo see though how there is tension between freedom, disagreement, competition and order, working in unison, cooperation. Good [\\@harari_yuval](https://x.com/harari_yuval) on [\\@seanilling](https://x.com/seanilling)\\'s \\\"The Gray Area \\| Yuval Noah Harari on the AI revolution\\\" <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhx1sdX2bow> on this.\n\nWe have implicit abstraction in our heads that X/Twitter is a kind of public square, with many-to-many N-to-N, ultimately all-to-all communication. It ain\\'t so. That N-to-N does not scale to N=100M users, it breaks down after N=10 or so.\\\nWhen a user posts something, that post is simply recorded on a computer (disk). Nothing more. Yes - it\\'s the user that presses the post button. No - that doesn\\'t push the post into millions of timelines. It\\'s the algofeed that takes that post, and shoves it into millions of screens.\\\nI am inclined to agree with Harari on that. Social media are Media, X is a publisher, and their algorithms are their editors. It\\'s fair to judge the algofeed should by the same criteria as the editor of any old media. It\\'s new kind of media, but it\\'s still Media. All elements are here, with small differences in operation or business model, and plenty of automation in top.",

So if there is a falsehood or slander in an advert - everyone can see it, then provide feedback and critique. In social media (e.g. FB) one-to-one advertising is completely private. Every one use may be shown a (a) separate and different advert, and (b) completely untruthful, and there will be no way for anyone else to know. The advert is 1:1 between the user and the platform, completely secret. Platforms should be required to provide access to the adverts they serve to a third party. Ideally - adverts should be available for inspection by all users at all times, and in an online archive too with the historic adverts there too.\n\nCommunity Notes. I got enrolled at some point (not sure why - I vaguely remember X offered, and I agreed) in the Community Notes programme on X. I get to vote on Community Notes others have written. And also to add notes for others to vote on - but have not done that yet.\\\nSomeone explained that the logic/istics behind is: find sufficient group of people that disagree on other issues, but agree on the note, for the note to be published. That strikes me as valuable insight. I\\'m surprised how well it works. Have to look up again the maths, the linear algebra of it - there was some SVD involved.\\\nIt\\'s good, but it\\'s wholly insufficient for a network flooded with falsehoods on an industrial scale. While the notes are being submitted and voted on, the Algofeed pushes the Post onto millions of screens. Then after a week, a Note is ready and published. From now on, it will be shown together with the original post - good. If I clicked Like or Repost, I will get a Notification that a Note appeared - good. However - millions of people that merely viewed the original post when the algofeed pushed it onto their screen - they will never see the Note.\\\nIt\\'s the Social Network equivalent to an old style Newspaper correction. A false story is splashed on the front page for millions to read. Then a week latter, Correction appears deep on page 23, that few read. Good that it happens - but insufficient.\n\nAs with other things, in social networks too: incentives -\\> results. Engagement is maximized when 1/2 of users are at the throats of the other 1/2, and that\\'s exactly the result we got. Took time but we are reaching that destination.\\\nI want to get 1000 Feeds on X, incl some user defined, instead of the medieval choice of 2 - \\\"For you\\\" and \\\"Following\\\". X went wide did Communities, some way towards conference style (current leader in that is Reddit), instead of deep improving the quality of their core product.\\\nAnother thing I want to see is RealHuman flag, and I\\'d pay small one off fee for that. And then to be able to filter on that flag (or not). That\\'s unlikely to happen too it seems.\\",

Only external event can force that, c.f. Brazil ban.\\\nBest one can do in the mean time is replicate their Social Graph, find their Follows and Followers, on alternative platforms. There will be insufficient traffic there. The \\\"public Square N\\^2 iron law of network value\\\" ensures the biggest network wins every time. NB the posts have rarely have permanent relevance. They are more like flowing water, are quickly re-created. Most are time-events-sensitive anyway, the content is non transplantable in time. It\\'s not the posts that keep users locked in the social network.\n\nThe \\\"social graph\\\" that is Followers-Follows is what keeps users locked in a social network. I saw the \\\"portable social graph\\\" 1st on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social). So having your Social Graph at the ready on an alternative place is half the job done. It\\'s also prudent - anything may happen to X/Bsky/FB etc, incl being banned by a misfiring algorithm (there is rarely any human support). Given alternatives are free - I see no reason to not reserve your favourite user nickname on Bsky or Mastodon or similar.\n\nPeriodically there is discussion on X/Twitter if users need or want to switch to some other network. I don\\'t think people will switch any time soon, unless forced to do. I keep accounts on multiple platforms anyway. Imo the largest single public square N\\^2 wins every time - that\\'s the iron law of social anything.\\\nIt\\'s expected and explained in (computer) networks: the number of connections \\~N\\^2 grows with the square of the number of nodes \\~N. And the value to us, users, lies in the interactions facilitated by those connections. And those connections accrue with the square of the user base. Between a larger (2N) and a smaller (N) public square, the larger one will provide as much value in a \\~day as the smaller one in a \\~week. Users will switch smaller-\\>larger, increasing the difference, in a +ve feedback loop. Until approx only 1 remains standing. Ultimately it\\'s a winner takes all.\\\nSwitching to another network is a very specific collective action problem. Social media natural monopoly network effect can only be circumvented by synchronization, moving \\*at the same time\\* by millions of users. The timeliness makes all the difference - must be all at the same time. So Brazil user base may switch b/c the ban forces them to move at the same time. UK user base is unlikely to switch as there is no ban.",

This was time of ISPs like Prodigy, AOL, Compuserve, some of which were standalone non-Internet connected platforms to start with (and connecting to the free Internet afterwards, some trying and failing in creating own private walled gardens). As Internet as is now didn\\'t exist! So they were kind of similar to a telephone company in that we used a telephone to access them. Like an add-on service to my phone service. Then with Internet ISP-s started adding services - connectivity to it, Internet email, maybe small personal web pages space, etc. In that context ISP-s got protection from liability arising from carrying user-generated content, in e.g. email lists, personal web pages and similar.\n\nIt strikes me that modern Social networks now are nothing like that.

Pictures and videos for looks, feelings. The most superficial or aspirational version of myself. Pure form, no function. Audience: everyone that would envy me, friends, distant relatives.\nd.  Twitter. Text mainly, short text messages. Text - content is the king not the presentation. Short - quantas of ideas, no place for long or subtle discussion. Shit posting and meming, esp on X. Audience: random unknown strangers, some under IRL names but lots of anon- and pseudo-anons, and bots.\ne.  Substack. Text mainly, personal web sites for writers. Longer text form, but also nice pictures and designs. Real people, and almost all under their real life names too. Highest SNR but takes effort. Audience: public intellectuals.\n\n\\\"The medium is the message\\\" is a catchy way to say the medium that carries the message affects the message itself, its content. The medium makes some kinds of messages easy to transmit (so they spread more), and other kinds of messages hard to transmit (so they don\\'t spread). Given that messaging in turn in/forms our ideas, and ideas in/form our stories, and we humans are influenced greatly by the stories in our heads, and then we influence and change the real world around us, it follows: the change of medium of communication is going to change our lives our behaviours. The Gutenberg press did that and there was huge change, then with the radio and latter TV too, and now in our lifetimes initially the Internet and latest social media are doing it too.\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\--\\\nLJ HPD Tue 15 Oct 08:21:21 BST 2024\n:::\n\n\n<!-- source: post-twitter.html -->\n::: {#content}",

    "text": "# Twitter surviving - personal considerations, tips, practices\n\nThis is a write down of how I (think I) use X (formerly Twitter). This is not - how to be popular, or how to be an influencer, or how to get a flock of followers. Even to the contrary - these are probably anti-patterns if your are aiming for fame & fortune.\n\nThese are written down what I think are my personal tips, previously unwritten guidelines, my own practices, of how I use X. I have gotten a lot out of X! There are many people that complain about all manner of things - but many many more that don\\'t. The number of interesting things, links, discussions out there - is mind boggling. By SNR - it\\'s way way better than the forums of old. I think - I put a only a little more effort than the minimal (about zero), to gain a whole lot more out of X. Same goes for Bsky. By default - both are pretty bland. But - put some effort in aggressively shaping your Follows-Followers, blocking and muting the worst offenders accounts (to whatever your taste is), muting words (esp related to some event - politics elections, football tournaments, etc), adding accounts to thematic personal List-s, and you may see disproportionate returns. There are interesting things out there - but they are like small fish in a humongous ocean. A very low probability finds. So like a gambler tilting the odds of fortuna ever so slightly to his advantage at every opportunity - do try to shift the otherwise unfavourable odds, make them be little less so.\n\nLately I notice similar usage patterns developing in my Bsky usage. Given there is only X and Bsky, and what was Twitter is now X, I will use the term the \\\"Twitter\\\" as a generic term to refer to both of them. Think possibly Mastodon is similar enough that it can be encompassed too. In the future - hopefully other networks too. The format seems general enough to be own genre. A social media network, primary text-based read/write, with short public posts as default, where posts can be considered minimal units of messaging, \\\"quantas of ideas\\\".\n\nX - tips, guidelines, my practices.\n\na.  On mobile use browser <https://x.com/home> or X app, <https://bsky.app/> or Bsky app. A browser tab is better than an App insofar one can open many tabs, with many views, while the App is only ever a single view. Further, better to use open web standards, and avoid using closed walled garden App-s where possible. What\\'s used lives and develops, what\\'s not used dies off.\nb.  On desktop use XPro <https://pro.x.com> [Tweetdeck](#){onclick=\"toggleShowImage('xpro-decks-lists-comms-1234')\"} and deck.blue <https://deck.blue/> [decks](#){onclick=\"toggleShowImage('deck-blue-2')\"}.

Assume value comes from connections between nodes.\n\nExpected hit rate \\~1% for minimal interaction (Like) that carries zero risk cost to the reader when reading a post user wrote.\n\nRules of thumb - break them with a reason, but not without any.\n\n1.  Accounts to follow: any that seem interesting, notable, authors of books, videos, blog posts, podcasts etc you have already read, heard, watched. If recognize the name or the face =\\> follow. Those that are mutuals - select +Notify on them to be reminded of their existing. X-algo mostly cares about \\'Follow\\'-ing, but not about \\'Mutual\\'-s where we both follow each other. Notifications were broken for most of X existing, but work lately. So use them for Mutuals. Mutual is a much stonger signal, N\\^2 instead of mere N. X is stupid/malevolent here - so use Notifications as a reminder for (Mutual,Now) post. Notifications should only be shown for Mutual-s. Where they are not a Mutual - turn off the Notification check mark.\n    \\\n\n2.  Follow back everyone that follows you as a default to start with. Take a chance on the possibility of interaction. (even if it\\'s a small one.) Exceptions obvious spam accounts: elonmuskXXX, phishingXXX, celebrityXXX, influencerXXX, cryptoXXX, tradeXXX, casinoXXX, girlXXX, motivationalXXX. Don\\'t follow obvious trolls, fakes, pseudoanons that are high volume general posters unless thematic (technology, science) that is of personal interest.\n    \\\n\n3.  When deciding should I follow or not, the question asked is: will I like to see this user posts in the future? Have your best guess - yes or no? Look holistically at the combined total of info available, forecast a) is the user a real human? b) will I want to read posts from them?\n\n                Info:      1-pic   2-namesurname     3-bluecheck                \\     / Scan for \"thick\" pic/name/bio, \"thin\" is a \"unfollow\" signal as default;\n                                   4-@nick           5-followsyou                +---+  look at follows/followers>5 ratio, last post/reply months or years ago;\n                                   6-bio personal intro presentation hashtags   /     \\ look of the number of posts or replies on their page, is it >100?\n\n                Up/Down:   1-pic presence/absence, girlpic no/yes; 2-namesurname human like yes/no; 3-bluecheck yes/no; 4-@nick {girly12345,crypto,trading,engagement} bad;\n                weight     5-followsyou yes/no; 6-bio missing or bad words - motivational, spammy, political, slogans, tags, politician/name, current/campaign morass.\n                Filtering: red flags - no pic, bad name namesurname12345, bad nick girl12345 (except where name and nick match), bad bio missing;\n                           bad words - \"travel love crypto animals countries flags trading politics god christ orphan\", acc ratio follows/followers>5;\n                           net evidence good/bad flags/words - look for collaborating up/down yes/no decide if to Un/follow.\n\n    \\\n    If spending more time than a split second to decide: Grok \\\"Summarise Profile\\\", check profile Pinned post, 1st page of Posts, Replies, Highlights.\n\n    \\\n\n4.  Prominent accounts of interest add to Lists. (independent of following/follow status.) Doesn\\'t have to be 1 single list, but don\\'t overdo it: don\\'t want too many lists to look same like the personal \\@acc. Create new lists, split existing lists at will. Lists: Tech-nology, ML-Machine Learning, QT-Quant Trading, Comp-uting, Data, Sci-ence, Chem-istry, Bio-logy, Phi-losophy, Edu-cation, Fin-ance, Econ-omy, Hist-ory, Cul-ture, Med-ia, Law, Pol-itics, Urb-anism, HPD-Harpenden, MKD-Macedonia, CEEu-Central Eastern Europe, Int-elligence. Assign account to list relative to the significance/meaning of that account to yourself - be very subjective. Depending of how special/general/distinct v.s. other feeds, do/don\\'t set at list level \\\"Don\\'t show these posts in For You\\\". Accounts followed that are high volume so there is 0 interaction - use Lists, add to list then Unfollow. Use \\\"Not interested in this post\\\" and \\\"Show fewer posts from\\\" in the \\\"For you\\\" to shape the feed.\n    \\\n\n5.  Accounts prolific posters, but boring, silly, propagandists, low SNR, low quality, crazies etc that X algos pushes - add to sink /dev/null list NIL. Then tick \\\"Do not show these posts in For You\\\" for that list in the individual list settings. Block is now uni-directional - use it more. Avoid Mute - it\\'s another chore list to go through in future un-Mute scans.\n    \\\n\n6.  If something is worth forwarding, then follow the account. Give it a chance, find out. If after a time turns out no synergy - unfollow latter. Exceptions---big accounts with HUGE following: like mass-media of old 1:N boradcasting, zero interaction---don\\'t follow. New follow account---add to a list. Look their bio, keywords matching a list - e.g. Tech-nology, Sci-ence - honour & add to that list.\n    \\\n\n7.  Unfollowing. Read the \\\"Following\\\" feed, find a posts you dislike, check \\@acc, if not a mutual - then Unfollow. General rule-favour doers. Don\\'t follow acc known for being known, non-human, #SLOGAN-s, nick123, marketeers, crypto, girlface, neuro/disorder, flags, bolded. Take a look at acc photo-name-nick-bio, ask yourself: do I recognize, can I recall of anything about this acc? If NO =\\> then Unfollow. If you recognize the acc profile, then: do I recall their posts, will I want to read again tomorrow? If NO =\\> then Unfollow. Don\\'t be petty. If you like someone\\'s posts - keep following. There is still \\>0 value in one sided interaction. Don\\'t spend time checking list membership, assume already checked and added. Accounts following your lists - follow too, look for synergy.\n    \\\n\n8.  Manual \\\"Activity Feed\\\". When \\@acc appers in Notifications, use the opportunity to check their posts. Go throught the top pages of their Posts, Replies, Highlights. Read posts, like and re-post, reply to any of interest. Keep in mind un/follow decision is a low-regret one. Be proactive, un-follow if Algofeed is too pushy, re-follow to check back after a time. Don\\'t bother with numbers, don\\'t spend time on QC checking lists, give up on manual curration. Just keep adding users to the lists. When the ratio Follows/Followers is too high, X will not allow you to add to Follow. Then go through the Followers list, just looking at the list Un-follow ones that a) can\\'t recall reading from b) don\\'t follow you c) lack BT d) lack pic e) lack bio f) lack IRL name.\n    \\\n\n9.  Your own posts. Like your own posts on posting - or not! Use AI to spruce them up - or not!\\\n    Reasons for liking your own:\n    a.  To remind self that you should really like what you post, to never be ashamed of it. If you don\\'t like what you post---how is anyone else to?\\\n        Keeps you honest on your toes. Don\\'t get sloppy. Don\\'t hide behind irony, allusions and other plausible-deniability cowardess.\n    b.  Reddit and Hacker News automatically credit one uptick to a post to start with, just for posting. Even if a post turns rubbish:\\\n        for the chance taken & effort put in writing/doing, in preference to not writing/keeping quiet, a small reward is deserved.\n    c.  Symbolic poetic gives it small good luck push. As if a departing boat. A reminder---once posted, post starts a life, a journey, of their own.\n    d.  So they show in the Liked tab, in context with all the other things read at the time and assumed like for making an impression enough to post.\n\n    Reasons against liking your own:\n    e.  It\\'s a bit pathetic, looks needy.\n\n    Use ChatGPT to massage and make more palatable longer posts. Try indicate to a knowing user that ChatGPT was used without being explicit:\n    g.  Use \\*\\***bold**\\*\\* and \\**italic*\\* formatting as is ChatGPT default, both for that but also b/c longer posts will warant some markup.\n    h.  Don\\'t explicitly disclaim: wastes space, is inelegant, gives credence to the \\\"naturalistic\\\" fallacy. (we don\\'t ack keyboard/computer either)\n\n    \\\n\n10. Mutuals - accounts where we mutually follow each other. Even if no significant interaction, persist. No interaction is probably to X never putting your posts in the their feed and vice versa. Chances of someone checking anyones personal page is \\~0. Only ever unfollow if suspect reading theirs reduce your knowledge. E.g. suspected Gell-Mann Amnesia. Don\\'t worry about the numbers, give up on manual curration. The aim is bi-directional interaction of high SNR b/c that\\'s \\*multiplicative\\*: 100 good connections outweigh 1000 poor connections. For that to happen---more likely if mutuals, than not.\n    \\\n\n11. Accounts that blocked you - block back too no exceptions. While it\\'s emotionally satifying (+1) and tit-for-tat is (paradoxically) fine strategy for better coordination (+2), the final decider (+Inf) is: obviously they found the interaction unsatisfactory. So now: don\\'t insist, that would be both stupid and semi-violent. Block them so to minimise any temptation for any future interaction that X may tempt you into. There are another 8B humans to potentially interact with. Give people a chance. Otherwise prefer (a) NIL sink list shunting; or (b) temporary turn off reposts X is too keen on. Avoid Mute - keep the Mute list empty, it\\'s too much hassle to be maintaining manually both a Mute and a Block list. From time to time semi annually go through the blocked list and unblock every account (ragardless if still blocked). It\\'s manual and 50 accounts/pop before getting throttled by X - but still persever and clear the list. Then start a new cycle from ground zero.\n    \\\n\n12. Increase the chance of interaction. Keep active - post, quote, reply, repost, like. Heed X \\\"Who to follow\\\" - follow accounts, unfollow if no traction. Add interesting posts on Highlights. Periodically scan, find topical or interesting post, repost if still relevance not expired with the time passing. There are 8e9 humans, 1e8 on X. Chance to match interests 1:1 is low 1e-16. Keep looking for high SNR interactions. Keep trying to improve the 1% hit rate. Do not attempt manual curation or moderation of the lists, follows, followers etc. Until platform constraint is hit - keep appending to the lists.\n    \\\n\nX algofeed is moderated every second of the time. Stats as follows. You follow 5000 accounts. Each one writes 1 post a day = 5000 posts a day. You login to X, X algofeed serves 50 posts on one screen full. Check X 10 times per day = 500 posts X will show you daily. That is 500 out of possible 5000 to be shown, and 4500 to not be shown. X must decide which 500, out of 5000 possible, to show you. Any one post has probability 0.1 to be shown. You will see 1 post from 1 account once in 10 days. X algo is non-random, tilts towards factors like accounts interaction, engagement via {Like,Forward,Quote,Reply} of posts, bio check. Prob decayed by time with half-life.\n\nXPro tweetdeck (TLDR: for every list in Lists, add Deck==list; add Deck==list-of-Lists; add Deck==Personal, add Deck==Communities):\n\ni.  Have List==Deck, add important frequent prominent posters from a List into the Deck.\nii. Where account belongs to multiple List-s, chose one List only and add it to that one list Deck only.\niii.

    "text": "# Knowing - what do I mean when I say I know something\n\nI was told \\\"the joint probability density function between two variables \\\\( X \\\\) and \\\\( Y \\\\) captures everything that there is ever to be known about the relation between those \\\\( X \\\\) and \\\\( Y \\\\)\\\" 25 years ago (¡Hola! [Miguel](https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mcarreira-perpinan/) :-)), and it\\'s been a blessing and a curse. Blessing - yeah the joint pdf \\\\( f\\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\\\) really does capture everything. Curse - often I read an article and think of the author \\\"wish someone told you too\\\", you poor soul.\n\nSo for me knowing something about \\\\( X \\\\) means knowing the distribution, the pdf \\\\( f_X(x) \\\\). Most of the time our knowledge is more than 1-dimensional, we have at least two qualities that we want to quantify the relationship of. So knowing something about \\\\( (X,Y) \\\\) jointly, for me means knowing the joint pdf \\\\( f\\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\\\).\n\nKnowledge is knowing the joint probability function - either density p.d.f. or cumulative c.d.f. (using p.d.f. mostly to illustrate). Density p.d.f. or cumulative c.d.f. is an implementation detail. Depends on the mechanics of the contraption, can be both in the same device, is up to the implementation.\n\nSo knowledge is - joint density, is co-counts, counting number of times things of interest co-occur, happen together. (in the 1st approximation; more accurate would be to say - knowledge is absence of ignorance, and our ignorance is what we measure by the joint density, the co-counts etc; our ignorance is never zero and consquently our knowledge is never complete)\n\nProbability is the measure of the residual uncertainty. Like length measures distance, probability measures uncertainty. Randomness is what gives us probability distributions that are not Dirac impulses, and thus gives us information content to work with.\n\nNB the single letters \\\\( X \\\\) and \\\\( Y \\\\) are multi-dimensional, \\\\( N \\\\)-dimensional and \\\\( M \\\\)-dimensional vectors. The domain of the pdf is \\\\( (N + M + 1) \\\\)-dimensional in general, with \\\\( N \\\\)-input \\\\( X \\\\), \\\\( M \\\\)-output \\\\( Y \\\\), 1-extra dimension where counting or quantity of probability density or mass happens. [+]{.sec-toggle aria-controls=\"time-detail1\" aria-expanded=\"false\"}[[ *(The one extra dimension where counting happens is time. Time is somewhat special TBD will concern with it latter. For now: without time there is no discrete events or observations and no counting either, so no joint density, so no knowledge either. Time is necessary - but not sufficient - condition for us to get to know the world around us.)* ]{style=\"font-size: 90%;\"}]{#time-detail1 hidden=\"\"}\n\nTime in space-time \\\\( (x,y,z,t) \\\\) plays the same role as the \\\\( p \\\\) axis in a joint probability \\\\( p=f(x,y) \\\\): it is the special dimension that lets us count, accumulate, and order events. No time, no counting; no counting, no density. Conversely probabilities are always positive while time only flows forward---both axes are bounded and one-way.\n\nThe split \\\\( (X,Y) \\\\) is arbitrary as decided by us. Usually - \\\\( X \\\\) is what we observe easily but we don\\'t care much about, \\\\( Y \\\\) is what we don\\'t observe directly but care about would like to know which one. So by relating \\\\( X \\\\) to \\\\( Y \\\\), we want to deduce something about \\\\( Y \\\\), while observing \\\\( X \\\\).\n\nThese things of interest are \\\"qualities\\\". Quality is one dimension out of N in an N-dim vector space. Within one \\'quality\\' that\\'s \\'what\\', we will measure counts those will be \\'quantity\\' or \\'how much\\' or \\'how many\\'. [+]{.sec-toggle aria-controls=\"time-detail2\" aria-expanded=\"false\"}[[ *(TBD consider latter, but: while and to the extent the dimension N can\\'t be forecast with 0 error from the other (N-1) dimensions, it exists as a separate dimension. Once it can be forecast with 0 error from the rest - it collapses and stops existing afa we are concerned.)* ]{style=\"font-size: 90%;\"}]{#time-detail2 hidden=\"\"}\n\nSpace itself can be phrased this way: what is truly \"nearby\" has a non-trivial joint distribution \\\\( p(\\\\text{here},\\\\text{nearby}) \\\\neq p(\\\\text{here})p(\\\\text{nearby}) \\\\). What is far apart factors and therefore forgets about each other. Closeness is simply dependence.\n\nIn the simplest case of a single quality, single dimension X in 1D, knowledge of X is the p.d.f. of X \\\\( f_X(x) \\\\). Everything that there is to be known about X is described by the re-normalised histogram of X where we count which ones of X, and then how many of which one.\n\nThe first non trivial case of knowledge is where we have two qualities, two dimensions X and Y, \\\\( (X,Y) \\\\) in 2D, knowledge is the joint p.d.f. of X and Y that is \\\\( f\\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\\\).\n\nEverything that can be known about the relationship between two qualities X and Y is captured and described about their joint p.d.f. \\\\( f\\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\\\).\n\nIf we know the joint p.d.f. \\\\( f\\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\\\), we can derive the prior distributions both for X that is \\\\( f_X(x) \\\\), and for Y that is \\\\( f_Y(y) \\\\), by marginalisation. Marginal p.d.f.s are \\\\( f_X(x) = \\\\int_y f\\_{X,Y}(x,y) dy \\\\) and \\\\( f_Y(y) = \\\\int_x f\\_{X,Y}(x,y) dx \\\\). Marginalisation is \\\"adding up\\\" the probability mass in the dimension(s) we don\\'t care about, the one(s) we marginalise out. Marginalisation maybe thought as \\\"forgetting\\\" - the detail is lost, but we achieve efficiency (less parameter), and robustness - we are not dependent anymore on the variable that was marginalised out (we are independent of it now - at least in our p.d.f.), [+]{.sec-toggle aria-controls=\"time-detail3\" aria-expanded=\"false\"}[[ *Keeping detail so not cost free, it takes resource implementing it. So if we don\\'t need a particular dimension particular quality for whatever our goals are - it\\'s better to forget about it.* ]{style=\"font-size: 90%;\"}]{#time-detail3 hidden=\"\"}\n\nOnce we observe one of the qualities that are \\\\( (X,Y) \\\\), e.g. X, that shrinks the domain from 2D to 1D, and now everything that can be known about Y is described by conditional p.d.f. \\\\( f\\_{Y\\|X}(y\\|x=a) \\\\) that is computed by plugging \\\\( x=a \\\\) into the joint p.d.f. \\\\( f\\_{X,Y}(x=a,y) \\\\), then dividing re-normalising that function by the prior p.d.f. of X \\\\( f_X(x) \\\\) at \\\\( x=a \\\\) giving rise to new conditional p.d.f. \\\\( f\\_{Y\\|X}(y) \\\\) for Y that is defined as \\\\( f\\_{Y\\|X}(y) = \\\\frac{f\\_{X,Y}(a,y)}{f_X(a)} \\\\).\n\nBelow I illustrate this point on the example of a joint pdf \\\\( p = f\\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\\\) that is a mix of two Gaussians in 2D space \\\\( (x,y) \\\\). We observe the variable \\\\( X \\\\), and that observations is \\\\( x=1 \\\\). The question is - what do we now know about the variable \\\\( Y \\\\), having observed the variable \\\\( X \\\\) (to be \\\\( x=1 \\\\)).\n\nThe observation \\\\( x=1 \\\\) is equivalent to the joint pdf being cut by the plane \\\\( x=1 \\\\). The intersection of the joint pdf \\\\( f\\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\\\) and the plane \\\\( x=1 \\\\) is \\\\( f\\_{X,Y}(x=1,y) \\\\). This curve is the best description of what we now know about the distribution of the unobserved variable \\\\( Y \\\\).\n\nThe starting model that was \\\\( f\\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\\\) is affected by the observation \\\\( x=1 \\\\). The effect is the intersection \\\\( f\\_{X,Y}(x=1,y) \\\\), and is outlined below. It is a function of \\\\( y \\\\), that is a scaled conditional \\\\( f_Y(y\\|x=1) = \\\\frac{f\\_{X,Y}(x=1,y)}{f_X(x=1)} \\\\). The conditional pdf is \\\\( f_Y(y\\|x) \\\\).\n\nThe scaler \\\\( f_X(x=1) \\\\) is the marginal pdf \\\\( f_X(x) \\\\) of \\\\( X \\\\) at point \\\\( x=1 \\\\). The marginal pdf \\\\( f_X(x) \\\\) is computed from the joint pdf \\\\( f\\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\\\) by marginalization, by integrating out \\\\( Y \\\\) as \\\\( f_X(x) = \\\\int f\\_{X,Y}(x,y)\\\\,dy \\\\) and then plugging in \\\\( x=1 \\\\).\n\nEverything that can be known about about anything can be construed as a relation between two things. *(at the baseest level - myself and the world, the I and not-I.)* Call them X and Y. So all knowledge about \\\\( (X,Y) \\\\) (what X tells us about Y, what Y tells us about X) - is in that X-Y relationship.\n\nEverything that can be known about X-Y relationship is captured and described about their joint p.d.f. \\\\( p=f\\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\\\) or just \\\\( p=f(x,y) \\\\) the density; or c.d.f. \\\\( p=g\\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\\\) then it\\'s just \\\\( P=g(x,y) \\\\) the cumulative. And that\\'s it. The probability distribution captures all that can ever be known about the \\\\( (X,Y) \\\\) relationship.\n\nOnce X \\\\( x=a \\\\) is observed, then everything that is known about Y is described by the conditional p.d.f. \\\\( p=f\\_{Y\\|X}(y\\|x=a) \\\\) or just \\\\( p=f(y\\|x) \\\\) at \\\\( x=a \\\\).\n\nThe 3D function \\\\( p=f(x,y) \\\\) is cut with a plane \\\\( x=a \\\\). The cross section is \\\\( f(x=a,y) \\\\). It\\'s not a p.d.f. as it does not sum to 1. The area of the cross section \\\\( \\\\{f(x,y),x=a\\\\} \\\\) that is a scalar is the area under \\\\( f(x,y) \\\\) at \\\\( x=a \\\\). This is also the value of the marginal p.d.f. \\\\( f_X(x) = \\\\int f(x,y) dy \\\\) at \\\\( x=a \\\\), i.e. \\\\( p=f_X(x=a) \\\\). To convert \\\\( f(x=a,y) \\\\) into conditional p.d.f. \\\\( f(y\\|x=a) \\\\) we divide joint p.d.f. \\\\( f(x=a,y) \\\\) with the scalar (constant) that is marginal p.d.f. \\\\( f_X(x=a) \\\\): \\\\( f(y\\|x=a)=f(x=a,y)/f_X(x=a) \\\\).\n\n[Joint marginal conditional pdf 1 of 3](#){onclick=\"toggleShowImage('pdf-joint-cond-marg-1of3')\"}.

Putting it in a wider context.\n\nWhen reading about knowledge, I have come across the following so collected here for future reference.\n\nWe can have 2 types of knowledge about the outcome of (repeated) experiment(s):\n\na.  [We know what will happen and when it will happen in each experiment. This is non-probabilistic, deterministic knowledge. NB it is a special case of [both](#know-pdf) [(b)](#aleo-pdf) cases below with the pdf being a Dirac impulse function.]{#know-dirac}\nb.  [We know the possible outcomes, we know how many of each will happen if we do 100 experiments, but for each 1 experiment, we can\\'t tell the outcome. This is probabilistic knowledge where we know the pdf (=probability density function) of the experiment outcome.\\\n    It is the aleatoric kind of uncertainty (see [below](#aleo-pdf)) - we know the statistics, the counts, but not what one outcome is going to be in every one experiment.]{#know-pdf}\n\nUncertainty - obverse to knowing, to knowledge, lacking (perfect, deterministic) knowledge, we can think of types:\n\nb.  [Aleatoric uncertainty means not being certain what the random sample drawn (from the probability distribution) will be: the p.d.f. is known, only point samples will be variable (but from that p.d.f.). We can actually reliably count the expected number of times an event will happen.]{#aleo-pdf}\nc.  [Epistemic uncertainty is not being certain what the relevant probability distribution is: it is the p.d.f. that is unknown. We can\\'t even reliably count the expected number of times an event will happen.]{#epi-unpdf}\n\nThe probabilistic knowledge of type [(b)](#know-pdf) above and aleatoric uncertainty of type [(b)](#aleo-pdf) are one and the same.\n\nThe 2D \\\\( (X,Y) \\\\) example is also useful to illustrate a further point. Once we observe \\\\( X \\\\), and work out the conditional pdf \\\\( f_Y(y\\|x) \\\\), the question arises - what next? What do we do with it?\n\nIf \\\\( Y \\\\) is discrete, we have a problem of classification. If \\\\( Y \\\\) is continuous, we have a problem of regression.\n\nWe have the entire curve to work with - and that\\'s the best. But often, we approximate the entire curve, with a representative value, and soldier on. Then the question becomes: well how do we chose one representative value from that curve?\n\nThe \\\"\\\\( X \\\\) observed \\\\( Y \\\\) not observed\\\" is arbitrary - it could be the other way around. We can generalize this by introducing a 2D binary **mask** \\\\( M \\\\), to indicate what parts of the vector \\\\( (X,Y) \\\\) are present (observed), and what parts are missing (and thus of some interest, e.g. we want to predict or forecast them).\n\nWith present data \\\\( X \\\\) and missing data \\\\( Y \\\\) in \\\\( (X,Y) \\\\), then missing data imputation is actually equivalent to forecasting regression or classification. The same logic works even if the mask is in time, but the signal gets much weaker when the observed parts are in the past and the unknown parts live in the future---time Now inserts another dimension that has to be overcome.\n\nSimplest case - X is 1-dim, Y is 1-dim, then knowledge of a \\\\( (X,Y) \\\\) relationship is the joint p.d.f. \\\\( f\\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\\\) that\\'s a 3-D shape. **Observation** is cutting that 3-D shape with a 2-D plane \\\\( x=a \\\\). **Intelligence** is using the 2-D outline \\\\( f\\_{X,Y}(x=a,y) \\\\) that\\'s the intersection between the 3-D joint shape and the 2-D \\\\( x=a \\\\) plane, to decide on the action to be taken. Now we have this new(er) knowledge (that normalised to 1 is conditional p.d.f. \\\\( f\\_{Y\\|X}(y\\|x=a) \\\\)), while still aiming for the same desired end as before.\n\nKnowledge of relation \\\\( (X,Y) \\\\) is the joint p.d.f. \\\\( f\\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\\\). Observation is cutting that 3-D shape with a 2-D plane \\\\( x=a \\\\). Intelligence is deciding on the next action---now we have 2-D shape \\\\( f\\_{X,Y}(x=a,y) \\\\), incorporating this newest knowledge about X (normalised to sum 1 is the conditional p.d.f. \\\\( f\\_{Y\\|X}(y\\|x=a) \\\\)). All the while still aiming towards the same desired goal as before. (the goals themselves are outside of this, are not considered)\n\nConditioning Y on X is observing the \\\\( x=a \\\\), and then re-normalising \\\\( f(y,x=a) \\\\) such that it becomes a p.d.f. again to sum to 1 \\\\( f(y\\|x=a) \\\\). Observing quality X that is \\\\( x=a \\\\), is shrinking the dimensionality from 2D to 1D. In general from \\\\( (N+1) \\\\)-dim back to \\\\( N \\\\)-dim.",

We can find a reasoning step \\\\( Z \\\\), that is \\\\( P(Z\\|X) \\\\), such that the conditional \\\\( P(Y\\|Z,X) \\\\) brings us closer to our end answer than \\\\( P(Y\\|X) \\\\) can bring us.\n\nThis is how hierarchies are made. Already \\\\( P(Y\\|X) \\\\) is a hierarchical relationship. Now conditioning on \\\\( Z \\\\) too, \\\\( P(Y\\|Z,X) \\\\), is another brick in the wall of a hierarchical relationship. Conditioning on X takes general N-dim \\\\( P(X,Y) \\\\), and reduces it down to at most \\\\( (N-1) \\\\)-dim space of \\\\( P(Y\\|X) \\\\). Conditioning even more on Z to \\\\( P(Y\\|Z,X) \\\\) does another slicing down, to at most \\\\( (N-2) \\\\)-space. From widest most detailed N-dim \\\\( P(X,Y) \\\\), to more general less specific \\\\( P(Y\\|Z,X) \\\\) at most \\\\( (N-2) \\\\)-dim.\n\nOne can undertake **motivated slicing via \\\\( Z \\\\)**. For slicing by \\\\( x=a \\\\) the \\\\( P(X,Y)=f\\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\\\) to get \\\\( f\\_{X,Y}(x=a,y) \\\\) (then renormalised by marginal \\\\( P(X)=f_X(x) \\\\) at \\\\( x=a \\\\) into \\\\( f\\_{X,Y}(x=a,y)/f_X(x=a) = f\\_{Y\\|X}(y\\|x=a) \\\\) call it conditional \\\\( P(Y\\|X) \\\\)) - we undertake that b/c we hope \\\\( P(Y\\|X) \\\\) is going to be sharper, more informative than a presumed wide un-informative \\\\( P(Y) \\\\). So we could be selecting such \\\\( Z \\\\), that \\\\( P(Y\\|Z,X) \\\\) is even sharper. And we have the \\\\( P(Z\\|X) \\\\) to judge how justified we are to undertake our motivated reasoning \\\\( Z \\\\) step.\n\nThere are infinite number of \\\\( Z \\\\)-s we can slice-condition on. The trick is choosing \\\"the right ones\\\" for \\\\( Z \\\\). They can\\'t be too divorced from \\\\( X \\\\), as then \\\\( P(Z\\|X) \\\\) will be very flat. The \\\\( Z \\\\) chosen also can\\'t be too divorced from \\\\( Y \\\\) - then it will not add anything over and above \\\\( X \\\\), which is already too far from \\\\( Y \\\\) for any useful guide, \\\\( P(Y\\|Z,X) \\\\) will be as good (bad) as \\\\( P(Y\\|X) \\\\). (even if \\\\( P(Z\\|X) \\\\) may show relation to X) Looks like the size of the step when moving X→Y can be max \\~20% in interestingness, but not more, to keep it true.\n\n**Chain of Thought (CoT), Chain of reasoning (CoR)**\n\nExtension to Type 2 intelligence: guided search through discrete space where reward is unknown in time and only becomes known after the last step in the sequence. Next step from Type 1 intelligence: pattern recognition single 1:1 input:output, reward known at every step.\n\nCoR now often has to invent its own \\\\( Z \\\\)-s (or \\\\( R \\\\)-s for \\\"reasons\\\"), rather than simply conditioning on an observed variable. DSPy-style systems optimise not only the answerer \\\\( P(Y\\|X) \\\\) but the question-poser that proposes \\\\( Z \\\\) so \\\\( P(Y\\|Z,X) \\\\) becomes sharp. Both the query and the answer become learnable objects.\n\nNon-reasoning autoregressive LLM-s: compute \\\\( P(Y\\|X) \\\\), then they sample from that distribution. Hence parameters like *temp-erature*, *top_K*, *min_p*, *top_p*.\n\nDiffusion models image denoisers: learn the first derivative of \\\\( \\\\log(P(Y\\|X)) \\\\), use that to get from the current sample, to a better sample, and they iterate. They add noise to in every step, and that serves to sample the whole distribution, rather than pick and converge to a single one point.\n\nAfaics the reasoning models add only one step extra. Assume there is no good choice \\\\( Y \\\\) for the \\\\( X \\\\) - say \\\\( P(Y\\|X) \\\\) is flat uninformative, there is no good guess for Y. So let\\'s figure out intermediate step Z. Then instead of \\\\( P(Y\\|X) \\\\), go after \\\\( P(Y\\|Z,X)P(Z\\|X) \\\\). NB summing over Z will recover exactly \\\\( P(Y\\|X) \\\\). The step \\\\( Z \\\\) is such that \\\\( P(Y\\|Z,X) \\\\) is informative, where \\\\( P(Y\\|X) \\\\) was not. So \\\\( P(Y\\|Z,X) \\\\) brings us closer to a better guess for \\\\( Y \\\\), in a way that \\\\( P(Y\\|X) \\\\) does not. Of course, what functions, and how they are fit, and how to chose bazillion of \\\\( Z \\\\)-s, and how to aggregate while searching - makes a world of difference.\n\nDiffusers learning gradients and autoregressors learning the density are complementary. If/when we have access to both the function and its derivatives we can approximate more operators on top of the pdf itself---think H- and L- updates that reason about how the entire distribution should morph in one step.",

A state with joint knowledge \\\\( f\\_{X,Y} \\\\) has \\\"working memory\\\" of the relationship. Marginalizing to \\\\( f_X \\\\) is forgetting Y, freeing up parameters space removing memory so losing specifics. Choosing which variable to marginalize is an act of attention allocation. Storing a joint p.d.f. over \\\\( (N+M) \\\\)-dims cost drops when marginalizing down to \\\\( N \\\\)-dim. We trade accuracy for efficiency, effectivelly compressing, so the trick is to forget just enough but not more than that. We pay for any complexity for memory of extra weights and for using them in the compute. So there is always cost. If removing the specifics, maybe b/c conditioning on those specifics barely changes the p.d.f, if we endup with almost the joint p.d.f. even in the conditional - the we lose almost nothing by the removal and save on processing and mainteinance costs.\n\nConversely each new variable introduced in the join p.d.f, that can be latter used for conditioning, enables for learning the particulars with more precision, enables drilling down. This extra extra dimension atm with our one-off learning will only latter be used for conditioning and nothing else. But we can imagine a case of continuous learning, like CoR, that seeks to find the right conditioning variables. Only in CoR this is just find some among the existing variables, while in continuous learning we will be creating a new axis of variance to be added to the joint p.d.f. and the joint p.d.f.will be modified. It doesn\\'t have to be zero-one, on-off. It can be continuous and even naturally occuring. With passage of time, a conditioning variable is ever more blurred, it decays, the conditional p.d.f. conditioned on that variable is ever flatter, ever less informative. At some point we just delete that extra variable and nothign changes in the p.d.f, as by that point the conditional p.d.f. was so flat observing the variable made almost not difference to the joint p.d.f. We can imagine the opposite process too, in continuous learning. As we star with sharpish informative conditional p.d.f., we keep discovering ever more examples related to the variable we are conditioning on. Maybe each new conditioning step is a re-memoization (loosely reminiscent of DRAM, or the Hebbs rule) preventing forgetting by keeping another dimension intact. But we pay in costs - the cost of memoisation, and the cost of compute when used latter. So we better gain some from the extra varaible too.",

At that point all uncertainty ends, seemingly never to return back. Death collapses the future functions (p.d.f.s) from general forms with uncertainty (anything but Dirac Delta-s), into a Dirac Delta impulse. The uncertainty ends, the Past finally catches up with the Future, erasing the Now time boundary in the process. For self anyways.

That mental sequence is how we make the jump from discrete to continuous.\n\nTime as sequence of events is the counter that labels the observations; it is not itself modelled by a joint conditional p.d.f. Time must be discrete for counting to occur. A perfectly continuous time would defeat counting (what does \"next\" mean?). Discreteness hints the underlying latent space is very high-dimensional.\n\nTime makes the jump from discrete to continuous space possible.

Qualities, Quantities, and Dimensions [+]{.sec-toggle aria-controls=\"appendix-e\" aria-expanded=\"false\"}\n\n::: {#appendix-e hidden=\"\"}\n**Quality and quantity.** Dimensions \\\\( (X,Y) \\\\) are qualities, and we quantify them each too. When do we add new quality and obversely when do we lose a quality (dimension)? ([LJ @ HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38261719)) The second \"law\" of dialectical materialism by Engels---\\\"the law of the passage of quantitative changes into qualitative changes\\\"---captures this nicely. Enough quantity becomes a new quality.\n\nSuppose I have a 5-dimensional observation and I\\'m wondering if it\\'s really only 4 dimensions there. One way I check is - do a PCA, then look at the size of the remaining variance along the axis that is the smallest component (the one at the tail end, when sorting the PCA components by size). If the remaining variance is 0 - that\\'s easy, I can say: well, it was only ever a 4-dimensional observation that I had after all. However, in the real world it\\'s never going to be exactly 0. What if it is 1e-10? 1e-2? 0.1? At what size does the variance along that smallest PCA axis count as an additional dimension in my data? The thresholds are domain dependent - I can for sure say that enough quantity in the extra dimension gives a rise to that new dimension, adds a new quality. Obversely - diminishing the (variance) quantity in the extra dimension removes that dimension eventually (and with total certainty at the limit of 0). I can extend the logic from this simplest case of linear dependency (where PCA suffices) all the way to to the most general case where I have a general program (instead of PCA) and the criterion is predicting the values in the extra dimension (with the associated error having the role of the variance in the PCA case). At some error quantity \\\\( \\\\gt 0 \\\\) I have to admit I have a new dimension (quality).\n\nEmergence, phase transition and similar: 1) where quantity is large enough (this condition is necessary but not sufficient) and becomes new quality 2) thus this new quality becomes a new dimension in the phenomenon investigated, so my observations data from N-dim vectors become (N+1)-dim. \\\"More is Different\\\" is a succinct summary of \\\"enough quantity becomes a new quality\\\".\n\nAn image is worth 16×16 words, but a program is worth \\\\( 2\\^4 \\\\) images. Kolmogorov complexity says a learning system finds the shortest program that explains the data. Compression is learning. A forecasting error of quantity \\\\( \\>0 \\\\) is the extra dimension---new quality---waiting to be captured. When the program makes perfectly accurate predictions, that dimension disappears or was never there.\n\n**TBD Ndim Space.** Ratio of Ncube/Nball. Does our intuition fail us about the representative values of a distribution when we go from low \\\\( N \\\\) \\\\( (N = 2) \\\\) to high(er) \\\\( N \\\\) \\\\( (N \\\\gt 10) \\\\)? For large N, Nspace in Ndim: (a) moves into the edges (b) every observation is an outlier (in some dimension). Does that mean the space becomes discrete, it discretizes?\n\nTBD Sparse representation, moving to symbolics and rules. Once the Ndim vector becomes sparse, we move from continuous representations to discrete symbolic rules. That's when we start writing down the rules explicitly.\n\n*Deciding on whether to create/introduce a new conditioner/dimension/variable/quality in the joint p.d.f. - yes or no, considerations*\n\n**Laplace's rule of succession.** From Tom Davidson at <https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Tg5pQCjpefFiqaKjw/limitations-of-laplace-s-rule-of-succession>. The general pattern is that if some trend has been going for N years, Laplace's rule says there's a 1/(N+2) probability the trend is broken next year and a 50% chance the trend continues for another N+1 years or more. Or if some event hasn't happened for N years, Laplace's rule says there's a 1/(N+2) probability the event happening next year and a 50% chance the event doesn't happen another N+1 years or more. Limitation: for N=0 the probability is 1/2 and that maybe a big overstatement. It typically overestimates the chance of unprecedented events occurring. In general, the problem is that Laplace's rule excludes evidence we already have at the start time about how likely something is to occur.\n\n**Lindy effect.** *(deciding to create new conditioner/dimension/variable/quality-2)* From John D. Cook at <https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2012/12/17/the-lindy-effect/>. Lifetimes of intellectual artifacts follow power law distribution. Assume survival time is a random variable X with a Pareto distribution with p.d.f \\\\( f(t) = c / t\\^{c+1} \\\\) for \\\\( t≥1, c\\>0 \\\\). A power law because in that p.d.f. the probability (density) is proportional to power of t. If \\\\( c \\> 1 \\\\), then expected \\\\( X \\\\) is \\\\( E\\\\{X\\\\} = c / (c-1) \\\\). Conditional expectation of \\\\( X \\\\) given \\\\( X \\\\) survived time \\\\( k \\\\) to now is \\\\( E\\\\{ X \\| X\\>k \\\\} = ck/(c-1) \\\\). So expected additional life for \\\\( X \\\\) is \\\\( ck/(c-1) -- k = k/(c-1) \\\\) and is proportional to the amount of life \\\\( k \\\\) seen so far. If \\\\( c = 2 \\\\), the expected additional life equals the life seen so far.\n:::",

Random steps are a way of searching through the global space. Without randomness we hill-climb to the nearest peak and stay there forever; the derivatives decay to zero, motion stops, intelligence halts.\n\nThere is no AI/ML without randomness: (1) Autoregressive LLM sampling---temperature, top_k, etc.--- prevent robotic outputs. (2) SGD uses noisy mini-batches; warnings about local minima never materialized because the noise keeps us moving. (3) Diffusion models follow the log conditional probability gradient but also add noise so they don\\'t collapse to a single sample.\n\nThat what works will keep being done, and finally will be overdone. Then things need to change in order for them to stay the same. It\\'s the dose that makes the poison: noise too small and we stagnate, too large and the structure dissolves.\n\nRandomness is the source of uncertainty and therefore information. Random steps implement global search instead of local greedy search. Trial and error equals variation and selection: trial == variation, error == selection.\n\nOpen endedness in that way is reminiscent of the diffusion sampling, and the role the noise term plays. If we add too much noise, the denoising fails. Too little noise, and the steps are tiny, nothing new is learned. The step needs to be just right---not too small, not too large. Kelly-criterion thinking says we should keep \\\\( \\\\mu/\\\\sigma \\\\lesssim 0.2 \\\\) for comfortable compounding (halve the leverage when uncertain). That heuristics rhymes with how CoR steps are ideally \"only\" 20% more interesting than the previous step.\n\nKelly criterion leverage: \\\\( f = \\\\mu / \\\\sigma\\^2 \\\\).

Organisms encode information about their environment in order to survive. The encoding costs energy and generates entropy. Organisms use that encoded information to gain or not lose energy. Only where the information cycle is net positive can life exist. Since life exists, nature cannot be \"too unpredictable\".\n\nLiving things decrease entropy; non-alive things increase entropy. (\\\"What is Life?\\\" by Erwin Schrodinger <http://www.whatislife.ie/downloads/What-is-Life.pdf>) Life is that what decreases entropy. (is this only taking into account the living thing only, within the boundary of it? b/c outside - the disorder may as well increase?)\n\nLife is in a goldlocks region between max uncertainty (random, entropy) and min uncertainty (Dirac delta): not too random, not too certain, just right random/certain as to be interesting.\n\nIn order to achieve entropy decrease, life needs to exercise 1) control, and 2) adaptation. Control starts with enclosure. A piece of space is enclosed using a membrane, a barrier, a border. The inside of the barrier needs to gain enough negative entropy, so to sustain itself and the wall. Adaptation is achieved with intelligence.\n\nAll living things are part of the tree of life. They are all related. So the life-o-sphere is expanding. One can think of life-o-sphere as a whole as a giant organism that is living.\n\nAtoms are only ever created and destroyed in rare nuclear reactions. Most of the time they are just reconfigured like Lego blocks. The atoms that make our bodies were lent to us. Atoms themselves are mostly empty space with smaller vibrating sub-particles. The relations between particles matter more than the particles themselves---like letters versus words.\n\nLife is self‐reproduction with variation. Life is ability to make decisions about the future and take action, and thus influence and change your own future. Intelligent life in biological sense is the ability to achieve the same goal via differing paths, different means.\n\nLife is recurring pattern. Joscha Bach \\\"We Are All Software\\\". We recognise the same person even if all molecules churned many times. The pattern repeats over time even if the details differ.\n\nLife is a cycle of generation, degeneration, regeneration. \\\"I\\\" is a collection of particles that is arranged into this pattern, that will decompose and be available to nature to reorganize into another pattern. Death is part of a gift economy. You are given this enormous gift, life. You enrich it as best you can. And then you give it back. (Emily Levine, Andreas Weber).

And what is the goal of anything that\\'s alive? The goal is to continue staying alive. Otherwise it dies and then stays dead forever. Short term we adapat to the enviroenment, and we adapt the environment to us. Long term we im-perfectly replicate, create im-perfect partial copies of ourselves. (could say \\\"it\\'s the recipe for replication that replicates, our bodies are the material realisations of that machine\\\"; dependnt of what we take to be \\\"I\\\") Stupid systems found in nature are never living - always dead. Can safely infer: \\\"if alive =\\> then not-stupid but intelligent\\\"? Reality has that search built in apparently.\n\nIntelligence definitions over/heard or read over time, short enough to be collected:\n\n- Behaving like a person. (Turing test)\n- The ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills. (dictionary)\n- Attaining consistent ends by variable means. (William James, psychology)\n- The computational part of the ability to achieve goals. (John McCarthy, AI)\n- Ability to acquire capability - efficiently. (Challet)\n- Doing more with less. (David Krakauer)\n\nLooks to me the way we adapt to the environment, and the way we adapt the environment, we achieve that by having a model of the environment, and a model of ourselves - in our heads. Then we forecast into the future, make a prediction. Then the future happens, and we get the ground truth from the reality around us. Then we compute the difference, the error, and try to reduce it: both by changing the model in our head to be a better predictor of the future, and by activelly changing the future by changing our environment too. Afaik this is what Fristons theories are about.

Humans are collections of organs and tissues, which themselves are collections of cells. A cell is itself a collection of molecular networks (and so on). The subunits are competent themselves. There is a scale up process in which these competent subunits give rise to an intelligent unit bigger than themselves (Michael Levin).\n\nThe value---and even the reality itself!---is in the connections, not the nodes. People move from villages to cities because density breeds civilization. Empires built trading outposts to create connections. Roman logistics favoured water routes because the connections mattered more than the raw distance. Value of a network scales with \\\\( N\\^2 \\\\) not \\\\( N \\\\): the value is in the connections.\n\nMode of operation online vs offline diverges. Online geeks tend to cooperate in good-good positive sum interactions. Offline scarcity sometimes locks people into bad-good zero-sum trades. The larger, looser internet neighborhoods proved fertile for altruistic building of the web, Wikipedia, blogs, AI. Knowledge sharing thrives where connections are abundant.\n\nNeural Networks architecture (N nodes of about the same power, with connections arcs between them scaling \\\\( N\\^2 \\\\)) implementing Parallel Distributed Processing implementing intelligence - should be a grander lesson. Having a single node that is much more powerful than the rest is how cancer behaves. Intelligent systems survive by distributing power.\n\nNB that any graph of N nodes can be described by a matrix \\\\( \\[N \\\\times N\\] \\\\). The graph operations are matrix operations---matrix multiplication implies a linear model at the base.\n\nNB the standard deviation and risk as measured by it only goes down with \\\\( \\\\sqrt{N} \\\\) the number of samples. So having the collective intelligence go up with \\\\( N\\^2 \\\\) the number of nodes counter-acts that. An individual node may sharpen its pdf with \\\\( \\\\sqrt{n} \\\\) data (and suffers curse of dimensionality). The system as a whole fights that by increasing \\\\( N \\\\) and the intelligence with \\\\( N\\^2 \\\\).\n\nN\\^2 mechanism that makes the network powerful is sharing of knowledge, that all N see what 1 sees. So it\\'s enough for every one of the N to see \\\\( 1/N \\\\) of the data in \\\\( 1/N \\\\) of the time, and to then share it with N others. So then all N get to see and learn whole data N. So the total knowledge is N, and is shared N times (redundancy), and that happens \\\\( 1/N \\\\) of the time---if the transfer of knowing between the N nodes is fast.\n\nThe real world can\\'t be sped up. So the only way to speed up is to divide the work, get them to do the work in \\\\( 1/N \\\\) of the time, and then share the knowing between themselves.\n:::",

Intuition: in the face of a novel situation, you pattern-match it to what you\\'ve encountered before and you \\\"just know\\\" what to do.

Reasoning: you consciously and deliberately analyze a novel situation, using a combination of abstract principles and step-by-step simulation. Like analyzing a chess position and simulating in your mind possible future trajectories.\n\nTypes of intelligence-s, (T-s): Type-1 pattern recognition, idea generation, guessing a not insane guess. Type-2 logical thinking, guided search through discrete space. Type-3 open endedness, directed but almost random hypothesis generation (active learning). Type-4 collective intelligence---AI-s coordinating (sometimes cooperating, sometimes competing) in AI society---where individual irrational behaviour aggregates into rational group-level feelings.\n\nWe share the meta-learning and meta-knowledge machinery with every other living thing: we\\'re leaves on the same tree of life. We are made of collective intelligences (cells, made of molecules\\...) and simultaneously build a collective intelligence (society). Human intelligence---and its stupidity---is collective too.\n\nWe live Type-3 intelligence whenever we seek novelty and interestingness.

At first the joint p.d.f. \\\\( p(\\\\text{press button}, \\\\text{song plays}) \\\\) is flat. The first time, surprise! High residual error.

Daniel Kahneman's \"Thinking Fast and Slow\" fits: Type-1 pattern recognition, Type-2 reasoning, plus these social Types 3 &iamp; 4 layered above.\n\nChains-of-Reasoning (CoR) is Type-2 reasoning layered on top of Type-1 N-gram guessing.

But had to write some recently, [so here](post-consciousness.html).\n\nOne view that seems testable to me: consciousness is like the conductor in the orchestra, it\\'s the router in an Mixture of Experts model. Consciousness module is the router in MoE. Experts in the MoE are the individual members of the orchestra, every one playing their own instrument. So while the router is not a very big or a very special module (in fact - it\\'s in many ways simpler then the specialised modules) - it\\'s *a single point of failure*. So once consciousness (in HI brain) / router (in IA MoE) fails - no expert can learn properly, or even if the experts learns, the knowledge can not be utilised.\n\nMoE architecture is the reason why it\\'s so data efficient. Sparse representations, by virtue of injecting that prior knowledge in the process (\\\"these connections for this data do not need updating\\\"), can be data efficient. It\\'s efficient to know in advance \\\"this data is no use to Experts 1,3,4,5, and is to be used to reach only Expert#2\\\". MoE maybe a reason why we have too many neurons. Our brains are less efficient than NN-s when it comes to utilising their weight. NN-s are much more efficient than us humans, when looking at efficiency in weights sizes space. Our brains trade parsimony in weights space, to gain efficiencies to gain speed and reduce power consumption - both achieved by MoE.\n\nFurther: sparse representations (and MoE is a macro-scale example) may make incremental learning, which is one way to implement continuous learning, practically doable. If only a limited set of weight need to be updated, for the brain to acquire new memory or knowledge, that means it can be done without losing all other previous memory or knowledge.\n:::",

Where our knowledge measure is the spikiness of the probability density function. After the additional observation (new information), the conditional p.d.f. post the observation is flatter then before =\\> our knowledge about the world decreased.\n\nMichael R DeWeese and Markus Meister (1999), [\\\"How to measure the information gained from one symbol\\\"](DeWeese_Meister_-_How_to_measure_the_information_gained_from_one_symbol_-_ne9403.pdf), [Network: Computation in Neural Systems, 10:4, 325-340](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1088/0954-898X_10_4_303), [DOI: 10.1088/0954-898X/10/4/303](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0954-898X/10/4/303)\n\nThe paper contains an example along the lines of: let\\'s say I want to know if I have cancer or not right now. Let\\'s assume that for my demographics, the chances of cancer at my age are 5%. So I can be reasonably sure that I have not got cancer (95%). Now I do a test, and the result comes back positive. Now - we know that half of the people that test positive turn out to have cancer for real, and the other half are false positives. After the test, my chances are 50:50 - I\\'m perfectly ignorant! Whereas before the test, I was fairly certain I have not got cancer. So the *new information* provided by the test, it *reduced my knowledge*: from almost certain, do perfectly ignorant.\n\n**Incomplete theory?** In betting when quant trading, we don\\'t just take the point forecast (e.g. mean \\\\( \\\\mu \\\\) ) and run with it. We take into account the 2nd moment \\\\( \\\\sigma \\\\), some measure of variability around the 1st moment, as our measure of risk. We use it to counter-balance using the first moment in point forecast with e.g. \\\\( \\\\mu - \\\\sigma\\^2/2 \\\\), or as part of a constraint on the size of the bet we will place. This is to express that we have at least two objectives. Yes we want to make earn \\$\\$\\$ (#2), but in order to do that, we have to stay alive (#1). We need to live to trade another day. Going bust is a game over, once we stop trading on day \\\\( 50 \\\\), there is not trading on days \\\\( 51, 52 \\... 100 \\\\) anymore. Our game is non-ergodic: a \\\\( 1..100 \\\\) sequence in time can not be replaced by ensamble of 100 copies of *us* in 1 time moment - that would imply independence. But us staying alive to trade day 100, depends on doing the same on days \\\\( 1, 2 \\... 99 \\\\).\n\nI like the Theory of Information finally gifted to us by [Shannon](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf) in the 20-th century. But sometimes I think that it\\'s more restrictive than it needs to be. Every result has a real physical embodiment, we could run an experiment, count, and see with our eyes that our intermediate result in a long chain of derivations holds (is true). That\\'s great, but maybe an overkill - the theory doing more than it needs to. Because often we don\\'t care about intermediate results, it\\'s not a must that intermediate results have physical interpretation. We really only care about the start, and the end - don\\'t care about the middle. The theory needs to work in the middle, but the practice doesn\\'t need to. E.g. we happily run with complex numbers, and they make things previously impossible to compute - possible. And yet - we don\\'t stop and requite 1:1 correspndence with reality at every step. It suffices that the 1st and the last step have mapping to reality. The intermediate steps - they don\\'t need to. E.g. using complex numbers in Fourer Transform in signal processing. Or using 1000s-dimensional vector spaces that we can\\'t even imagine, and certanily can\\'t see. There are concepts like \\'confidence\\' supplementing \\'forecast\\' probailities, that are not as straightforward to express in the current framework as one would hope. Maybe [extension to complex probabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03759), or even just [ingenious](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02901) [tricks](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2512.07525), will come to be helpful and useful? TBS\n\nAnother unaddressed issue by the Theory of Information has always been - model size, how much data can support how big a model, or more general - model discovering structure in the data, HOWTO. The way we do model sizing by trial an error, and without much useful theory we can apply, always felt unsatisfactory. (\\'make the model smallest it can be, but not smaller\\' - is the extent of the help we practitioners get) It\\'s delightful when the issue pops up even in ordinary computer use with puzzled users \\\"why can\\'t I zip my zip file again, and shrink it even more??\\\" 😅 Recent interesting read [From Entropy to Epiplexity: Rethinking Information for Computationally Bounded Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03220) - TBS if anything practical transpires.\n:::\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\--\\\nLJ HPD Wed 20 Nov 2024\n::::::::::::::::\n\n\n<!-- source: post-ml-llm-dev.html -->\n::: {#content}",

The moment people started mass copy-pasta code to-fro chat-gpt, was the moment we all realised: ah-haa! Why do people go through all the trouble, jump through hoops, inconveniences etc, to do that? Because they found it useful! I did it too, I too found it better than the alternatives: 1) coding for myself, solo, me-myself-and-I alone wiht my-code (now), and 2) pestering colleagues to read, them being grumpy the same way I\\'m grumpy when my attentiion is dragged from writing what interests me, into reading something else someone else wrote what interests them. Thrashing my context inthe process. :-)\n\nThe agents have been tremendous success and seen tremendous progress. I\\'m amazed. I got \\$250 free CC-web credits when subscribing to a new Anthropic \\$20/mo sub, and proceed to run Cluade Code - Web for 2 weeks now on-and-off. This was CC running on a virtual box somewhere in the cloud, and communicating via github push/pull and web gui. All the while running Curson for my day job - with the RL trained internal model that\\'s both fast and good, it\\'s a breeze to use. Then there are random CC session on demand in the terminal.\n\nAt the start of Oct-2025 codex became so good, that every time I have an idea, I just open a terminal in a directory, and run codex: I command the codex, codex commands the command line. 😆 For me AGI arrived with codex-5-high. I\\'m loving that socratic dialogue became the new programming. 🥰 In a dialogue between myself and codex, a set of actions emerges materialises somehow, and the job is done. 🤯 In this New-as-old world, we got Chat-as-programming, Dialogue-as-code, LLM-as-cpu, Context-as-ram. Once the QA session exhausts what was on my mind, I pause Ctrl-Z codex into background. On the next session, I continue summon codex back in the foreground with \\$ fg, and continue from where we stopped last time.\n\nIn VSCode I got Cline using OpenAI API on localhost:1234 served by LMStudio. Recently got plessantly surprised to find out both got streaming support for MiniMax-M2 xml based use of tools. Did not expect that! And before that got Claude Code in terminal to use local LLM served by LMStudio. Vai e local litellm proxy running in docker and translating between Antropic API CC wants, and the OpenAI API LMStudio provides.",

And even better if reading well than poorly. Internet - in addition to being free - IETF very early on cottoned on the fact \\\"no human readable -\\> no human will get interested -\\> no one to make it work -\\> stays cr\\*p and dies for lack of use\\\". So one could follow SMTP, POP3 and be not only readable, but read oh-key at leasat in not excellent. Formalisation of these things into some xml monstrosity is good when teaching principles to students. It\\'s bad if used in actual practice. Much better to in practice make use of every nook and cranny to your advantage, use any accidental twist and turn, to make things more efficient, easier etc. UTF-8 backward compatible variable length encoding comes to mind.\n\nThe setup is as straightforward as it gets.

Onto Cursor - nice but not much gained, not even wrong.\n3.  Over to aider cmd line - some result there, even if cr\\*p result\\... but looks like it could be improved?\n4.  Current VSCode gui + Cline addon + OpenRouter payg credits + Claude model. Well hello!! Finally produced something not obviously wrong.\n\nUntil today the best I got was: in ChatGPT-o4/o1- etc, copy & paste code snippet(s), ask a Question, then incorporate the Answer in the soluton. So this was a replacement for 1) googling and reading web pages 2) search through Stackoverflow Q&A.\n\nThis is the 1st time I got code inserted in 3 files. That required AI to 1) read through 5-6 files 2) compare and contrast, reason by analogy 3) take my requirement Q in considerion 4) edit 3 files, delete some code, insert some other code.\n\nI have my main codebase, about 200K LoC in an array/matrix language mostly, with some C/C++/bash/awk/sql too.\n\nI\\'m agnostic Re: tools. Fallback always available is bash/vim/Makefile/gcc/g++/gdb/ddd/shell/\\... tools. But if IDE like VSCode/Spyder/CLion/Matlab/DBeaver is available - I\\'m happy to use. As long as it\\'s not exlcusive, and one can edit/setup outside the IDE too. And esp important version contol - git now, prev hg, cvs, Teams. If that works - then all is good.\n\nI tried Cursor. That looked hopeful, but did not get me results. I didn\\'t like not being able to use existing API subscriptions in it. Also them using some kind of LLM in-house undocumented bodge. (I maybe wrong/maybe possible - didn\\'t try too hard)\n\nI then tried aider, a command line tool. That managed mutiple edits, but to not too good results. Waste of time wrt results, but: it was a good learning curve for me. I PAYG subscribed OpenAI -\\> DeepSeek -\\> OpenRouter.\n\nOpenRouter leader board led me to Cline VSCode addon. Latest-greatest setup atm 1) VSCode 2) with Cline Addon 3) OpenRouter API key (payg credits) 4) select Claude 3.5 via openrouter/anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet.\n\nThe dev task was as follows. Functionality A/B/C needs implementong. Look at existing wrapper X implementing A/B/C, while using Y external library for A/B. Create new wrapper U, to use external library W, in the same way X is using Y, to do the similar A/B. (C is done in X and U respectivelly) E.g. - see how the data is passed X-to-Y, then do it the same way U-to-W. Look at examples code in the W library, figure how to do A/B.\n\nThis to avoid doing the reading abt W and figuring A/B myself. I can do it myself, have done it half a dozen times already, for U/W equivalents, but: bit boring, and wanted to find out if I can make AI do it for me.\n\nHave yet to finish the full loop, the code does not run yet. But - before it was laughably obviously bad and wrong. Now - the 1st time where the code looks plausable. Need to do a harness to test finally. To be continued.",

    "text": "# Data Debugging\n\nWhile reading Spinellis [https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/so/2024/04/10547621/1XvqtG0iCoE](https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/so/2024/04/10547621/1XvqtG0iCoE){target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"}, I was inspired and reminded to write down some data-debugging related practices so that I don\\'t forget about them (may come handy in the future), and also may help someone else. If you have more - please share.\n\n1.  Piping is useful for running things in parallel, especially with the multi-core machines we all use nowadays. Pipes provide the simplest dependency graph, and they have automatic IPC synchronization courtesy of the pipes FIFO-s flowing from one process to the next. That allows for individual processes in the pipeline to be run independently on different cores with the data flowing between allowing them to keep busy and not stall waiting.\n\n2.  Drawback of data flowing through the pipelines is that data flow is invisible to us and no record remains of the data available for inspection and debugging. Replacing a pipe \\\"\\|\\\" with \\\"\\| tee tempfile \\|\\\" allows for subsequent inspection of the \\\"tempfile\\\" to see what the data looked like.\n\n    Example - debug:\n\n    \\\n\n          $ for a in {1..10}; do echo $a; done | wc -l\n\n    as\n\n    \\\n\n          $ for a in {1..10}; do echo $a; done | tee tempfile | wc -l\n          $ cat tempfile\n\n3.  Vectorised processing via numpy or in languages like matlab or array languages where the default data type is not a scalar (but an array or Ndim array in general) makes peeking into the individual values being aggregated or processed hard and needing extra effort.\n\n    a.  Use hardware support for NaN to your advantage to prevent accidentally using missing data. Convert missing data on input into NaN in memory where possible (data is float or double). Any operation with a NaN will result in a NaN, so it will be detected in the end. In contrast, stand in values for missing data like 0 can be used undetected.\n    b.  If possible structure processing in the form of apply(function,array) so to use a kernel function that data will flow through. Then insert logging inside it to inspect data flowing through, turn it on/off where insight/speed is needed.\n\n4.  Use any data invariants to your advantage. Add asserts liberally to catch data breaking invariants as early as possible. If possible designate not-a-value for other types (analogous to NaN for floats) where possible, even if the hardware support is lacking: 0 for indices (assuming 1-based), INT_MIN as INT_NAN for integers, nullprt for pointers.\n\n5.  This book has been useful to me for coding, but lessons apply to data too - \\\"Writing Solid Code\\\" by Steve Maguire.\n\n6.  Data is used to run experiments, and experiments *must* be reproducible (b/c - science!). So:\n\n    a.  Any external data source used (and thus outside our control) must be cached.\n    b.  It must be possible to run the whole experiment without touching any external data source, only using cached data - so any run is reproducible.\n    c.  Often it\\'s possible to leverage binary native de/serialization capabilities with a bit of care and prologue/epilogue code blocks.\n\n    Example - python:\n\n    \\\n\n           name = cache_name()\n           try:\n               with open(name, 'rb') as f: st = pickle.load(f)\n           except IOError:\n               st = fetch_from_external_source()\n               ... (maybe initial preprocessing, cleaning) ...\n               with open(name, 'wb') as f: pickle.dump(st, f)\n\n    Example - matlab:\n\n    \\\n\n           name = cache_name();\n           st = load_struct_from_mat(name);\n           if isempty(st)\n             st = fetch_from_external_source();\n             ... (maybe initial preprocessing, cleaning) ...\n             save_struct_to_mat(name, st);\n           end\n\n7.  Version data: where possible/space allowing, and often where the data is ASCII (e.g. .csv or .tsv files) - add it straight to a git repository.\n\n8.  Version data: where not possible b/c too much space - version the binary blobs outside a repository using the filesystem.\n\n9.  Keep ASCII files (.csv, .tsv) on disk compressed in a streaming-friendly format, not only to (a) save space, but also to ensure (b) integrity via checksuming, and possibly even to (c) speed up reading.\n\n10. Use formats like .zstd and .gz that are append and rsync friendly, e.g. where if\n\n    \\\n\n          $ zstd -c file1 >file.zst; zstd -c file2 >>file.zst, \n\n    then\n\n    \\\n\n          $ diff <(zstd -dc file.zst) <(cat file{1,2}) \n\n    produces no diffs.\n\n    Use \\--rsyncable in gzip and zstd (NB bzip2 lacks that) to create rsync-friendly compressed files.\n\n11. If keeping ASCII data compressed (e.g. .csv.zst) in git can enable comfortable diffing - in .gitattributes add:\n\n    \\\n\n          *.csv.zst diff=csv.zst\n\n    while in .gitconfig add:\n\n    \\\n\n          [diff \"csv.zst\"]\n          textconv = zstdcat\n\n\\\n\\\n\\--\\\nLJ HPD Sun 16 Nov 2025 21:18:54 GMT\n:::\n\n\n<!-- source: post-picmem.html -->\n:::::: {#content}",

    "text": "# Links to Blogs, Substacks, Youtubes, Podcasts, Magazines etc\n\nOver the years online, I benefited immensely from the Internet users that write and put up stuff online for other users to read. For the love of it - nothing else. There is no purer form of creativity than that. \\\"Here!! I like this, maybe you will like it too. On an off chance, infinitesimally small, I make this extra step extra effort to put it out there on the Internet. Free, free like beer and freedom too, for all to see\\\".\n\nInitially and for a long time things were kept and curated in Bookmarks. Then Google spoiled me when it became possible to \\\"Google it\\\" anything - there was no great need for Bookmarks. Then Internet expanded and some things are Social media posts, others are Substacks, still others are old style personal blogs, then there is Youtube podcasts and videos, then Spotify, then podcasts on other platforms etc etc. So I thought this is a good place - yet another place; but redundancy is the mother of resilience - to add links to content I liked and consume online. References and links put in no particular order, as my memory blurts them out. It\\'s good to have them on one page and check from time to time.\n\nNowadays with every author being online, one gets to imbibe their ideas anyway on the 80/20 principle, via the \\\"quanta of ideas\\\" that are memes, spread esp via X/Twitter/Bsky where the medium specifically encourages that. So when I finally get to a book or a movie of the author, I already have heard or seen 80% of what they are saying, know of the ideas, so often I don\\'t get to finish the book or the movie! I\\'m not complaining though - but bragging about it! Because there is something else already worthy of attention! We are so so lucky now. Some of my memories of my childhood (in the 1980-s late socialism of Yugoslavia) are of mind bending boredom. There was little to do, life was very boring at times (not all the time - other times it was fun and exciting), that reading a mildly interesting book, watching an interesting movie on TV (1.5 channels) or in the cinema (not that many of those), or playing - or more often watching others play - random games in the local arcades tent, was a treat. Home computers changed that somewhat, and then Personal Computers and latter the online world and Internet changed that a lot! And for the better.\n\nScott Alexander\\'s Astral Codex Ten<https://www.astralcodexten.com/> (previous Slate Star Codex <https://slatestarcodex.com/>)\n\nJ.

        "text": "## Q: What is your current working definition of consciousness?\n\nEverything I\\'ve heard from [Joscha Bach](http://bach.ai/) (JB) makes every sense to me. (and [Michael Levin](https://thoughtforms.life/)) I have not got much to contribute on top of that. So just enumerating things heard and remembered (even if not super-faithfully) here. To have a brief in one place.\n\nThe last thing that personally puzzled was: why is consciousness such a big deal? Yeah we have reasons to think \\\"there is something there\\\", and we can\\'t \\\"pin it down\\\". But our world is filled with such wonders. Why is consciousness so special? IDK. Then recently heard JB on a podcast say \\\"Aristotle didn\\'t think consciousness was a big deal.\\\" - and that made me feel better. (latter I heard Pinker say that Dennett thought it \\\"not a biggie\\\" too) Maybe I should take consciousness more seriously. But that would be like a non-believer that realises he\\'d be better off, if he could make himself believe in a deity, when surrounded by theists. Now knowing I\\'m not the only one thinking it\\'s not that big a deal, and knowing of other - infinitely more illustrious - names, eases the discomfort.\n\nObservables that must be true about consciousness (by JB). I agree with JB and this makes every sense to me:\n\n1.  Lower level, maybe even lowest level, not \\\"the pinnacle\\\". E.g. baby that grows into a Nobel prize winner had consciousness before they became Nobel prize winners.\n2.  Necessary for learning, bootstraps knowledge acquisition. Entities lacking consciousness can\\'t learn, don\\'t learn. Unfortunate kids with brain damage lacking consciousness never learn much, stay almost plants. Zombies in movies lose consciousness at the point of zombification. Their knowledge is frozen to that point, they learn nothing new from that point onwards.\n3.  Has element of self reflection. We know that we know.\\\n    This looks less solid than 1-2 above to me. It maybe we are just telling a story, simply doing what brains ordinarily do (construct models on the fly), just on a specific questions about the brain, when turning the brain instrument unto explaining itself, it creates a model. Completely like every other model the mind constructs, nothing special. Like LLM chain of reasoning: asking for self-reflection \\\"why did you output this\\\" - it simply comes back with another plausible story, completely unrelated to its inner workings. That the object being modelled is the brain itself, makes zero difference. It\\'s like chip design software, running on x86 itself, designing an x86 chip, versus designing an ARM chip. Running on x86 designing x86, does as good a job as, running on x86 designing an ARM chip. No reason to suspect the software running on x86 will do a better job designing x86 compared to designing ARM.\n\nPutting 1 + 2 + 3 together, I\\'m guessing, consciousness is:\n\n4.  Feature of ours and animals brains architectures that implements constraints important for learning quickly in the real world. Something that constrains the weight space, so we learn before we become food for others. It must be evolutionary selected if it appears in every living thing. Must confer some advantage. Learning quicker that the competition is an advantage.\n5.  Constraints act on the internal representation, on the weights of the brains networks. A small controller module, that affects the network weights of the rest of the network. It\\'s action is to constrain the other weights in some way, reduce the space of values the rest of the network weights can take. Like enforce consistency, some kind of averaging in time.\n6.  Maybe enforcing something meta- about the weights, like regularisation - \\\"prefer smaller weights\\\", or maybe sparsity - \\\"prefer fewer non-zero weights\\\". (yeah regularisation and sparseness are in tension with each other) These maybe means-to-an end: ways to end up with the trillion dimensional weight space avoid some pathological cases.\n7.  Or maybe it\\'s one-off, developmental, like choosing architecture, layers (what neurons never connect). So once the brain develops almost fully past childhood + teenagehood, it becomes less relevant.\n8.  The puzzle that biology HI use less data than AI, is more data efficient - maybe consciousness is a factor there? If knowledge is represented as acquired (joint) probability function, just placing a bump quickly in it at the (leaves rustling,tiger)-point rather than waiting for it to occur 10 times offers survival advantage.\\\n    To my mind everything that can be known about the relationship between X and Y is expressed by their joint p.d.f. \\\\( f\\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\\\). Knowing that function [**is knowing**](post-knowing.html). Intelligence is querying it with an \\\\( X \\\\) observation \\\\( x = a \\\\), and coming back with knowledge about the goal \\\\( Y \\\\) from the conditional \\\\( f\\_{Y\\|X}(y\\|x=a) \\\\) that has better error profile than the unconditional marginal \\\\( f_Y(y) \\\\). (both conditional and marginal functions are derivable from the joint) \\\"Better profile\\\" is minimizing future expected surprisal. (\\\"expected\\\" there implies knowledge, the joint pdf; only having knowledge gives rise to expectation.) \\\"Surprisal\\\" is the residual part we fail to forecast.\\\n    Aside: Chain-of-Reasoning is when we come up with R, which is not observed but created as an idea in our mind. R can be a possible factual like X (possible in the world). But also R can be a counter-factual, impossible to appear as observation X. Either way, this has to be such R, that P(Y\\|R,X) brings us closer to a \\\"good\\\" Y than P(Y\\|X) does. (NB from the joint we also have P(R\\|X) at our disposal too.) These CoR discrete jumps via R, (possibly across local saddle points?) aiding searches via R, can\\'t be steps too far. They have to be close (\\~20%?) to the current state, for us not to get lost. (if too far the chance of being of use drops a lot; like stepping over stones crossing a river)",

Via commonality - wherever I observe some consciousness effect 1-3 above, I then seek evidence to support finding 4-8 above. Via contrasting - wherever I observe consciousness effect 1-3 above, where I found 4-8 above, now I look to remove 4-8, and see if the effect 1-3 disappears. So compare and contrast both. Need to gather both positive pro- and negative anti- evidence, as in the case of consciousness, both the Q-uestion, and the A-nswer, are unknown. There are too many moving parts for much comfort. Maybe that\\'s the \\\"hard problem\\\" referenced??\n\nConcrete steps:\n\n9.  Given it\\'s shared by all living brains, assume it\\'s shared by all AI brains. Take a bunch of LLM-s. Then look - along the lines of the work of [Evelina Fedorenko](https://www.evlab.mit.edu/) seeking commonality in common language space - look find common things between them, that can be fit in the 1-3 observations above.\n10. Look at work of the likes like [Chris Olah](https://colah.github.io), try divine features that are structural. And than look again for that commonality in all of them, with an eye to 1-3.\n11. Assuming all current LLM-s are conscious to non-zero degree, would think of ways how to zombify them. Whatever I think I found in {9,10} above, try to destroy undo that. Do the networks become less conscious now? In terms of 4-8?",

Perpetual learning without end. Digital/AI systems collapse. (so we stop training before) Whereas analogue/HI systems (all live systems in general) don\\'t crash and burn, learning without end doesn\\'t undermine them. (except in psychiatric/mind illnesses maybe?)\n13. Truly online learning.

Whereas digital/HI have mini-batches so we need buffers, and epochs \\>1 so we need \\\"true\\\" (computer) memory. That learning regime is not even that well justified by the maths of it. (more like \\\"motivated\\\" by somewhat hand-wavy control theories)\n14. Counter arguments to 12 and or 13 above, why not do them. Maybe the above 12/13 are not connected strictly to consciousness, but connected to: HI is good with many more parameters than observations, while (current) AI is good with many more observations than parameters.

        "text": "## Addendum after listening to the Tegmark ToE interview. (sep2025)\n\nI liked everything [Max Tegmark](https://x.com/tegmark) said on that. And especially liked him say \\\"enough with the aww-shucks what impenetrable mystery could-be-this could-be-that impossible for us mere mortals to tell; let\\'s design experiments, and measure, and yes it\\'s not easiest to measure but not impossible too - physicists measure far more nuanced things all the time, and lets start ruling out some guesses.\\\"\n\n\\\"How Physics Absorbed Artificial Intelligence & (Soon) Consciousness\\\" <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gekVfUAS7c>, [Theories of Everything](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ7ikzmc6zlN6E8KrxcYCWQIHg2tfkqvR) with [Curt Jaimungal](https://curtjaimungal.substack.com), Sep-2025\n\nConsciousness view: it is like the conductor in the orchestra. It is the router in an Mixture of Experts model. Consciousness module is the router in MoE. Experts in the MoE are the individual members of the orchestra, every one playing their own instrument. So while the router is not a very big or a very special module (in fact - it\\'s in many ways simpler then the specialised modules) - it\\'s **a single point of failure**. So once consciousness (in HI brain) / router (in IA MoE) fails - no expert can learn properly, or even if the experts learns, the knowledge can not be utilised.\n\nMoE architecture is the reason why it\\'s so data efficient. Sparse representations, by virtue of injecting that prior knowledge in the process (\\\"these connections for this data do not need updating\\\"), can be data efficient. It\\'s efficient to know in advance \\\"this data is no use to Experts 1,3,4,5, and is to be used to reach only Expert#2\\\". MoE is a reason why we have too many neurons. Our brains are less efficient than NN-s when it comes to utilising their weight. NN-s are much more efficient than us humans, when looking at efficiency in weights sizes space. Our brains trade parsimony in weights space, to gain efficiencies to gain speed and reduce power consumption - both achieved by MoE.\n\nSparse representatios (and MoE is a macro-scale example) may make incremental learning, which is one way to implement continuous learning, practically doable. If only a limited set of weight need to be updated, for the brain to acquire new memory or knowledge, that means it can be done without losing all other previous memory or knowledge.\n\n\\<p\\>At this point maybe one needs to distinguish that consciousness may refer to (a) the basic algorithm that drives the process of self-organisation (b) the result of that process, the state of the brain once it goes 0-\\>1 and becomes conscious. Either way it\\'s like SGD learning and Type 1 learning aka \\\"pattern recognigtion\\\" (1 signal on input-\\>1 response on output and 1 reward) in that it is concerned with (c) very short time horizons, and enables the most basic of (d) survival functionality; and (e) further learning like RL learning (sequence of signals on input-\\>sequence of responses on output but only 1 reward at the end).\\</p\\>\n\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\\n\\--\\\nLJ HPD Sun 27 Jul 2025 15:12:26 BST\n:::\n\n\n<!-- source: taste-is-all-you-need-always-has-been.html -->\n:::: {#content}",

Yet, the notion that the key to making recognition more robust is to reduce the\ndifference between training and test conditions is still commonly held. As ASR applications move\nfrom tightly controlled to more natural environments with a varying number of unpredictable\nsound sources, this assumption is becoming less and less viable. Decoding the speech source of\ninterest while listening to several sound sources at the same time seems a more accurate description\nof the ASR process that suits these challenging environments. This thesis discusses the theoretical\nand practical issues which arise from this viewpoint. The aim is to explore the division of the\nproblem of robust ASR into two subproblems: (a) identification/separation of the speech and\nnoise using speech properties alone; and (b) recognition based on the resulting partial evidence.\nThe basic assumption is that some regions of the speech time-frequency representation remain\nrelatively unaffected by the noise, that they can be identified and that they alone are sufficient for\nASR. In contrast to conventional techniques which require models of all sources in the auditory\nscene and their subsequent decoding even when only one of the sources is of interest, the techniques\ndescribed in this thesis make no such requirement. However, they are flexible enough to use this\ninformation if it is available.\nTwo techniques are used to adapt a conventional Hidden Markov model (HMM) based ASR\nsystem to use partial evidence: (i) marginalisation of the state distributions, so that only the\nlikelihood of the reliable regions is assessed; and (ii) imputation of the unreliable regions by\nreplacing the unreliable features with a single point from the state conditional distributions. In\nboth cases, the ”counterevidence” - assessing which states are unlikely to have generated the\nspeech underlying the unreliable regions dominated by noise - further constrains the decoding. The\ntechniques are evaluated on the Aurora 2 connected digit recognition task, and seem to perform\ncompetitively. In the experiments, the reliable features are identified via local SNR estimates\nderived through stationary and adaptive on-line noise estimates. The potential of the techniques\nis indicated by using the clean speech to identify the reliable regions in the noisy speech, where\nthe accuracy is maintained even at -5 dB. The simple all-or-nothing assumption (the feature is\neither reliable or unreliable) gives rise to a model linking the recognition and the separation as\ntwo interdependent sides of the search for the most likely explanation of the noisy data.\n\n\fAcknowledgements\nFirst I would like to thank by supervisor Phil Green who has made this work possible. His\ndirect support through balanced encouragement, suggestions, criticism and freedom, as well as the\nindirect support as head of the Speech and Hearing Group (SPandH) in Sheffield which turned\nout such a terrific place to work and be during the course of my studies, has been invaluable.\nI thank my adviser Martin Cooke who has been a source of inspiration throughout the PhD\nand an early pioneer of many of the ideas explored here. He also provided the most of the software\nfor the early set of experiments.\nI have benefited greatly from the interaction with other members of the Speech and Hearing\nGroup in Sheffield. Without trying to mention each one individually, I just wish to thank Miguel\nCarreira-Perpiñán for lending himself available for long discussions, and Jon Barker for putting\ntogether the CASA toolkit (CTK), used in the latter set of experiments.\nDavid Pearce from the Motorola UK Laboratories in Basingstoke has been a patient listener and\nsupporter of our ideas, and I thank him for making possible a productive eight months internship\nin Basingstoke.\nThe work reported here would have been impossible without the support from Motorola and\nthe University of Sheffield. The work was also supported by the Chevening scholarship of the\nBritish Council, provided by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and a PhD scholarship from\nthe Ministry of Science of Republic of Macedonia.\nFinally, I wish to thank my family. Thank you Petrula for the courage, patience and the\nunconditional support. Thank you Kalen and Vedar for bringing me such a joy and fun. Thank\nyou mum and dad for the unwavering support in difficult circumstances.\n\n\fContents\n1 Introduction\n1.1 Motivation . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Kubala et al., 1991; Murveit et al., 1991). The performance is good\nenough to be deployed in commercial products. However, when used in “noisy conditions”, their\nperformance deteriorates rapidly to a point where they are unusable in practise (Agaiby et al.,\n1997). We refer to this as a problem of robustness of the ASR systems. Compared to the human\nperformance in less then ideal conditions, ASR systems perform an order of magnitude worse,\neven when specially adapted to cope with that particular kind of degradation, as illustrated by\nTable 1.1 which summarises a recent comparison on various corpora and types of speech (Allen,\n2002; Lippmann, 1996). Current systems seem usable on speech which is generated for machine\nrecognition, rather than for listeners. Applications like recognition of spontaneous speech in spoken dialogue systems (especially over the phone), recording legal proceedings, taking minutes of\nmeetings or recognition/transcription of broadcast news (Pallet et al., 1998) are still too hard.\nThe performance figures cited in the literature vary from 2% word error rate (WER) for airplane\ntravel system with medium vocabulary to 50% WER for large vocabulary dialog system (Comerford et al., 1997). Human WER on similar spontaneous speech is around 4%. It seems that the\nproblem of robustness is one of the important obstacles on the way to wider deployment of speech\nenabled products (Sagayama and Kiyoami, 1997). In this thesis, we will use the term “robustness”\nto mean “robustness to added noise” or, more generally, “robustness to the presence of other sound\nsources”.\n\n1.2\n\nObjectives of the thesis\n\nIt is well documented that humans can cope with unnatural and unseen degradations, seemingly\nwithout prior training or adaptation. They can ignore broad range of degradations and deletions\nin time and frequency domain, while still taking into account whatever information or cues are left\nfor the recognition. Humans seem capable of utilising the partial information left in the degraded\nspeech (Allen, 1994). This is exactly the capability that “missing data” approach researched in\nthis work tries to utilise for improved accuracy of an realistic automatic speech recognition (ASR)\nsystem in less–then–ideal conditions. The main aim of the work reported here is to investigate\nwhether a realistic system, working with realistic speech corpora and in realistic noisy conditions1 is\nfeasible, and whether it seems possible to deliver performance improvements now or in a foreseeable\nfuture. Other aims of the thesis include reviewing and consolidating previous work that might be\nof interest, looking for a realistic candidate techniques than could be used for speech identification,\ninvestigating the variants of the techniques for adapting the ASR system to handle partial speech,\nidentifying the root causes for performance degradation in noisy conditions.\n1 but still disregarding the Lombard effect\n\n1\n\n\fCHAPTER 1.

Other types of noises and/or degradations (convolutional noise, reverberation, etc.) are\nout of the scope of this thesis.\n\n1.3\n\nContributions\n\nMissing data ASR extends/adapts the monosource ASR model dominant today to a multisource\nauditory scene. The extension is “economical” in a sense that not all sources need to be decoded if\nonly one is of interest. The idea has been applied to a full–blown ASR system for connected digit\nrecognition, together with techniques for actual separation of the sound sources (however primitive\nthey are). The main contribution of the thesis is that the complete missing data (MD) ASR chain\nhas been tested with realistic noises, expected to be encountered in a typical application. Several\ntechniques, like Token Dependent Noise Estimation (Section 6.4.6) and adaptive local SNR estimation (Section 6.4.2), have been developed during the course of the experiments for the purpose\nof obtaining a mask estimate. The SNR based separation has been tested completing the MD\nASR chain in full. A new technique named bounded state based data imputation (Section 5.5.5,\nalso pp. 86) has been developed that can be used not only to recognise, but also to reconstruct the\nfull speech spectrum out of the partial speech. The probability of the mask estimate has also been\nintegrated in the MD ASR system (Sections 5.3, 5.4.1) leading to improvements in the accuracy.\nThe missing data (MD) model separates the problem of robust ASR into two distinct parts:\nspeech–noise separation/identification and speech modelling. This allows for use of “simulated\ndata”, so it is possible to judge which of those two underperforms in noisy conditions. The work\npresent here points to poor speech identification, rather then poor speech modelling, as the root\ncause of performance degradation.\nAll the work reported here has been done in collaboration with other members of the Speech\nand Hearing Group (SPandH) in the Department of Computer Science at the Sheffield University,\nUK, during the course of several years. Appendix E attempts to acknowledge the contributions of\nthe people involved in the work reported here. Any missattributions and/or lack of are solely my\nfault, and I would gladly correct the errors if/when notified.\n\n1.4\n\nOverview of the thesis\n\nThe thesis consists of seven chapters and several appendices.\n\n\fCHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION\n\n3\n\nFigure 1.1: Six talker–independent speech recognition corpora used to compare humans and machines (reproduced from (Lippmann, 1996)).\nChapter 2 is a review of the other approaches to the problem of robustness in ASR taken so\nfar. The chapter follows a fairly standard taxonomy of techniques arising from the view that lack\nof robustness is due to a mismatch between the conditions during training and testing of the ASR\nsystem.\nIn chapter 3 the original motivations and the structure of a ASR system operating under\nassumptions that the data is missing are lied down. It also reviews the previous MD work.\nChapter 4 discusses the problem of sound sources separation from the mixture. Section 4.2\nshows how computational auditory scene analysis (CASA) may be used to tackle this problem.\nSection 4.4 outlines some of the techniques for local Signal–to–Noise Ratio (SNR) estimation that\ncan be used as an (computationally cheap) alternative to CASA methods. Section 4.3 discusses\nthe model used for general (not only for speech) blind source separation and its relation to MD.\nChapter 5 lays down the techniques used to implement the ideas underlying our current understanding of the MD process in a context of a standard HMMs–based recogniser. It introduces\na model for MD ASR treating the mask as a random variable.\nIn the subsequent Chapter 6 the results of the experiments where a MD ASR system is applied\nto “standard” tests in robust ASR are discussed. Connected digits are the corpus of choice, and\nexperiments are carried out using both some of the NOISEX noises and the Aurora 2 noisy digits\ndatabases.\nThe last chapter, Chapter 7, is a discussion about the relationship between the MD techniques\nand some of the “more established” as well as “emerging” techniques for improving the robustness\nof the ASR systems. It also attempts to answer some commonly asked questions about MD ASR,\nspeculates about a possibility of a system that fully integrates the recognition and the separation\nparts of the system and draws the main conclusions from this work.\n\n\fChapter 2\n\nReview of techniques for robust\nautomatic speech recognition\n2.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nTodays ASR systems perform well enough to be deployed wide range of applications. However,\nmoving the applications from tightly controlled to real world environments remains a challenge.\nThe migration exposes problems rooted in our ignorance about how to model the sources of\nspeech variability in changing acoustic environment, previously masked by the assumption of a\nquiet environment and single source auditory scene.\nThe aim of this chapter is to present and discuss various approaches that have been used to\nincrease the robustness of the ASR systems. It briefly introduces some of the factors contributing\nto the speech variability first. It then moves on to concentrate on the variability due to noise.\nSubsequently, it introduces the notion of an acoustic environment to describe the interaction\nbetween the speech and the noise. Next it proceeds with classification of the techniques for\nimproving the ASR systems robustness into three large groups. Number of techniques from each\ngroup are introduced in the following text. At places the division seems a bit artificial – but\nthis is a common problem facing any attempt to bring under a common umbrella techniques that\nhave evolved mainly independently and over some period of time. However, it is evident that the\nclassification is coherent with the architecture of the todays prevalent statistical ASR systems.\nTowards the end of the chapter combinations of techniques as applied in real world tasks are\ndiscussed. The chapter concludes with a summary of the techniques. Appendix A summarises\nthe performance of the techniques published in the reviewed literature. However, the value of the\nsummary in assessing the relative merits of the techniques is limited. Until very recently, there was\nno de facto standard task (and corpus) to assess the techniques for robust ASR. The researchers\nhave been using vastly different systems and speech corpora, leading to inability to compare the\ntechniques across different research groups.\n\n2.2\n\nOrigins of speech variability\n\nSome common reasons for variability in speech are:\n• contamination with noise (additive, convolutional, reverberation);\n• speaking style (Lombard effect, speaking rate);\n• inter speaker variations (voice quality, pitch, gender, dialect);\n• task/context (dialogue, dictation, conversation).\n\n4\n\n\fCHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR\n\n5\n\nKajarekar et al. (1999)’s study on the origins of the speech variability found that the phone (with\ninfluence spreading beyond phoneme boundaries), the context and the speaker contribute most to\nthe variability and are interdependent. A principal component analysis (PCA) of the sources of\nvariability of the models trained on speaker–dependent speech pointed to the gender difference as\nthe most significant factor (Kuhn et al., 1998).\nNoise\nAdditive noise usually results from a microphone picking other sound sources in addition to the\nspeech that is to be recognised. These are sounds generated by the office equipment, coming from\nthe traffic on the street, etc. The human auditory system is so robust to this degradation that\nhumans aren’t aware of it most of the time. Additive noise is additive to the speech signal in the\ntime domain and in the complex spectral domain. It can be also assumed additive on average\nin the power spectral domain. The noise can be stationary (constant) or changing with time\n(non–stationary). The short burst of noise are known as impulsive noise.\nConvolutional noise or linear filtering refers to the way speech changes on its path from the\nsource (mouth) until it is converted in digital form. The reasons are numerous – from interaction\nwith the walls of the room to the imperfect transduction by the microphone, telephone, etc.\nConvolutional noise is multiplicative to the speech signal in frequency domain, hence the term\nlinear filtering.\nIn a typical environment, a microphone mounted on a table in front of a speaker picks up\nnot only the actual speech, but copies of the speech that bounced off the walls and arrived at\nthe microphone with some latency and distorted. This is known as reverberation. So, the signal\nobserved through the microphone is a sum of the original speech (coming through the direct path)\nand several delayed copies (although their amplitude diminishes quickly) of this speech convolved\n(linearly filtered) with the rooms impulse response. These secondary, tertiary... (and further)\ncopies of the speech can not be simply considered as noise. The noise is assumed independent\n(and thus uncorrelated) with the speech, and exactly the opposite is true in the reverberation\ncondition–the additive components coming from the reflections are obviously strongly dependent\non the original speech. Usually algorithms based on multiple observations (arrays of microphones)\nare used to handle this type of degradation, but the results are far from perfect. This is one of\nthe reasons why in most applications, users of the todays speech technology products use close–\ntalking microphones. Humans seem to have a robust mechanism for suppression of the copies of\nthe signals arriving up to 40ms after the initial signal, if they are not significantly louder (the\nprecedence effect).\nOther factors\nThe Lombard effect (Junqua, 1993; Junqua et al., 1998) refers to a change in the speaking style\nwhen the speaker is in a noisy environment. The speaker articulates her/his speech in such a\nway that it is more noise–robust for human perception. Therefore, this affects all information\nextracted from the speech signal (speech features) used by the present ASR systems at a great\nextent, hindering its performance. It is not simply the case of speaking loudly and/or slowly.\nMaking more vocal effort changes articulation style in a complex way. The Lombard effect also\nmakes data–gathering for robust ASR difficult: speech produced in a truly noisy environment will\nbe different from speech produced in quiet, with noise added on later.\nThe speaking rates of the speakers can vary significantly too. It changes not only in response\nto the acoustic environment, but also because of a number of other factors.\nThe voice quality, gender, age, dialect are another source of variation in the speech that ASR\nsystems have to take into account. Todays systems are usually trained on a large collection of\nspeakers, making them speaker independent (SI). During the enrolment phase (if there is one),\nor using few initial sentences of the dialogues (when there isn’t an enrolment phase), the system\nderives the speaker dependent (SD) models from the SI models by some form of adaptation of\nthe SI models. However, for most of the present systems there usually exists a small category of\n\n\fCHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR\n\n6\n\nspeakers for whom (due to different factors) the system exhibits exceptionally high WER – the so\ncalled “sheep & goats” phenomenon. This is another issue that hinders speech enabled products\nand solutions.\nTrying to apply ASR systems trained on read speech to the task of ASR of spontaneous speech\nspeech researchers have found that there is a big difference in the articulation of the speech, the\npronunciation and the vocabulary of the speaker when (s)he has a task to accomplish (various\ndialogue systems with some aim like information retrieval, tickets reservation, etc). Continuous\nread speech (e.g. dictation), speech in a dialogue and conversational speech all make difference\nfor the present recognisers. Therefore, the recogniser has to be tailored to the specific task.\nThe following work is mainly concerned with the variability due to additional noise. This can\nbe considered as robustness in the stricter sense. The term “additional noise” refers to any sound\nin the auditory scene that is not the speech the systems attends and tries to recognise. It can be\nspeech, as well. Techniques for handling convolutional noise will be reviewed as well, since it is\nalso commonly encountered noise.\n\n2.3\n\n“Mismatch between the training and testing conditions”\nview to the problem of robustness\n\nThe “mainstream view” on the problem of robustness in ASR today is that performance degradation in ASR systems is due to the difference between the statistical properties of the speech\nthey receive at their input when employed in a real-life application, and the speech used for training (estimation) of the parameters of their statistical models during system construction (Gong,\n1995; Furui, 1997). This is commonly referred to as a “mismatch between training and testing\nconditions” view of the problem. Usually, the training conditions are: clean speech (although this\nneed not be always the case) and speech gathered from different speakers, with different genders,\nspeaking rates, dialects etc. (Paul and Baker, 1992; Muthasamy et al., 1992; Phillips et al., 1992;\nCole et al., 1992).\nTraining the recogniser in matched noisy conditions\nThe “mismatch” description of the problem implies its solution: collecting training data in the\nsame conditions as the testing data (“the same” in a statistical sense, that is, drawn from the\nsame source/distribution). Therefore, no mismatch is going to occur and the ASR system is\nboth designed and trained and used on the same type of speech. However, many factors influence\nvariability in the real world. They are also interdependent. It is costly and difficult to put together\nenormous amounts of data to reflect all possible combinations of sources of mismatch.\nA larger problem is that it is not certain that this approach can deliver the performance needed\nfor applications in noise. There is a possibility that deriving models from such heterogeneous data\nmay lead to flat models with poor discrimination performing badly in every particular, concrete\ncondition (Lee, 1997). Recently, recognisers trained in a “multiconditional regime” on speech\nwith added noise (four realistic noise types) at several SNRs (clean, 20dB, 15dB, 10dB, 5dB)\nfeatured average word error (WER) increase from 1.48% on clean speech to 38.29% on speech\ncontaminated with noise at 0dB global SNR (Hirsch and Pearce, 2000). The task was connected\ndigits recognition.1 Even with a reasonable match between the training and the testing data,\nthe performance remains unacceptable for application. Further, the recogniser doesn’t show any\nfurther degradation in performance when tested on a data contaminated with four other (then\nthe ones used for training) types of noise. This weakens the claim that the solution is to match\nthe training and the testing conditions exactly. The existing techniques for noise suppression\nand robust ASR manage to decrease the WER significantly (Hariharan et al., 2000). But this\n1 Informal trials with small number of subjects on the same corpus indicate that the performance of human\nlisteners just about starts to deteriorate at 0 dB SNR\n\n\fCHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR\n\n7\n\nparticular task is fairly simple and it is difficult to say whether the widely practised techniques\nwill scale up to a more difficult one.\nAdaptive ASR\nAnother way to reduce the mismatch between the training and testing conditions is to make the\nrecogniser adaptable. Ideally, the recogniser would be aware of the conditions it operates in.\nUpon detecting an particular acoustic condition, it should adapt correspondingly. This approach\nrelies on (explicit or implicit) prior knowledge about the nature of the noise and how it differs\nfrom the speech it is mixed with. The usual assumptions are that the speech and the noise are\nindependent and thus uncorrelated, and that the noise varies slowly. Unfortunately, many common\nenvironments feature reverberation and impulsive noises which fall out of this category.\nMost of the recognisers today use a combination of both matched training and adaptation to\nimprove the robustness. The training data taken represents as much of the variability as possible\nwithout sacrificing too much performance. During recognition, various adaptation techniques,\nthat are both knowledge based (assuming some noise characteristics and how it combines with\nthe speech in the mixture) and data driven (using speech data from the particular environment\nin which the recognition occurs) are usually deployed in the recogniser.\n\n2.4\n\nModelling the acoustic environment\n\nSpeech models trained on clean speech are sufficient for ASR of clean speech, without additive\nor convolutional noise. However, in noisy conditions, the observations are result of a complex\nacoustic environment, with the speech source being only a part in it. The other two components\nare:\n• the noise source(s)\n• the way speech signal combines with the noise signal(s) to form the observations that are\nfed into the recogniser\nThe knowledge of the above factors, in addition to the knowledge of the speech, completely describes the auditory scene for the purposes of ASR.\nAdditive acoustic model\nFor example, if speech and noise are additive in some domain x = s + n, then the p.d.f. of the\nnoisy speech is the convolution of the p.d.f.s of the speech and the noise:\nZ\npX (x) = pS (u)pN (x − u)du\n(2.1)\nEven techniques that don’t assume explicitly the nature of the two factors above, implicitly use\nsome knowledge about them. So they too can be accounted for in this view of the noisy environment.\nConfining the modelling to speech mixed with convolutional and additive noise only, the observed noisy speech z can be expressed as a function of the speech s, the convolutional noise h\nand the additive noise n (⊗ denotes the convolution operator):\nx(t) = s(t) ⊗ h(t) + n(t)\n\n(2.2)\n\nThis model (in various guises2 ) has been used extensively by most of the researchers in the robust\nASR in the past (Acero, 1990; Gales, 1995; Moreno, 1996; Stern et al., 1996). The power spectrum\nof the observed signal is:\n|X(w)|2 = |S(w)H(w)|2 + |N (w)|2 + 2|S(w)H(w)||N (w)| cos(θ)\n2 Matrouf and Gauvain (1997) use the equivalent x(t) = h(t) ⊗ (s(t) + n(t))\n\n(2.3)\n\n\fCHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR\n\n8\n\nwhere θ is the angle between the speech and the noise vectors. Assuming no prior knowledge about\nthe θ (i.e. it is uniformly distributed in [0, 2π]), the expected value of the noisy power spectrum\nis:\nZ 2π\n1\n2\nE{|X(w)| } =\n|S(w)H(w)|2 + |N (w)|2 + 2|S(w)H(w)||N (w)| cos(θ)dθ\n2π 0\n= |S(w)H(w)|2 + |N (w)|2\n(2.4)\nHence the frequent assumption that with enough smoothing the speech and noise power spectrums\nadd up to the power spectrum of the noisy speech.\nOften, additional assumptions are introduced in the environmental model:\n• the additive noise n is independent of the speech s\n• the convolutive noise h is constant over time and independent of the speech s\nThe first one is almost universally true. It is necessary for derivation of the p.d.f. of the noisy\nobservations out of the speech and noisy p.d.f.s. The second assumption allows for the convolutive\nnoise to be modelled as an additive constant in the log–spectral domain. There are models for\nspeech and noise separation which do not make this assumption (Section 4.3). However, almost\nall ASR systems assume at least slowly varying gain in the log-spectral domain.\nMAX model\nAnother common model of how the speech and the noise combine (in the feature domain) to\nproduce the noisy speech features is the MAX model. It is applied on features in log–spectral (or\nlog–filterbank) domain. It has been observed that in this domain increasing noise leads to gradual\nsubmergence of the less energetic speech features beneath the noisy ones (Figure 3.2). This can\nbe modelled as if the noisy speech (feature) is:\nx = max{s, n}\n\n(2.5)\n\nThe principal reason for this is the logarithmic–like compression exhibited by the human hearing,\nand mimicked by the feature extraction process in all ASR systems. Assuming that the speech and\nthe noise are additive in time and power spectrum domains (e.g. previous section), the compression\nof their sum can be approximated by a compression of the bigger of the two:\nlog(x) = log(s + n) ≈ log(max{s, n}) = max{log(s), log(n)}\n\n(2.6)\n\nFigure 2.1 depicts the MAX approximation, the correct value and the relative absolute error of\nthe approximation for a typical range of speech and noise filterbank features. The relative error is\ngreatest along the line s = n, but quickly decreases with the inverse of s (and n). In the extreme\ncase at (0, 0) the relative error reaches 100%. However, in real speech this rarely happens. Most\nof the time either speech or noise features have values well above zero and the approximation is\nuseful. The effect of this environmental model on the p.d.f. of the noisy speech is discussed in\nSection 3.5.1.\n\n2.5\n\nTechniques for robust ASR\n\nThe mismatch between the training and testing conditions because of additive and convolutional\nnoise can be reduced at several levels of the ASR system’s speech processing chain. Commonly\nencountered approaches can be classified as (Gong, 1995):\n• using inherently robust features\n• speech signal “enhancement”\n\n\fCHAPTER 2.

Most often this is the “gross shape” of the spectrum. The result of the\ntransformation is a feature vector.\nIn the second stage, a discrete state space is searched for the most probable path of quasi–\nstationary articulatory configurations that might have resulted in the observed sequence. In the\nspeech recognition systems today this is commonly expressed as looking for a “word” W0 out of\ndictionary of all “words” the recogniser can recognise with the property:3\nW ∗ = argmaxP (W |O)\n\n(2.7)\n\nW\n\nwhere O are the observed features extracted in the first stage.

A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR\n\n11\n\nThe first factor P (O|W ) is the acoustical model. It expresses the constraints about the way the\narticulators could have moved to give rise to a particular sequence of feature vectors O in the\nrealization of the “word” W . The constraints are derived from hundreds of hours of speech during\nthe system training (construction). The second factor P (W ) is the language model. It expresses\nthe probability of the word W before any acoustic evidence is seen. It is usually derived from a\nhuge collection of written texts.\nThe recogniser can generate all possible hypothesis W , compute the probability of each one\ngiven the evidence, and choose the most probable hypothesis W ∗ as an answer. For an isolated\nwords recogniser this is a simple task. In a connected words recognition task, the hypothesis space\nmay grow larger, but it can be searched efficiently and exhaustively with the Viterbi algorithm.\nFurther, only on a small vocabulary task the recogniser can use separate model for each word.\nThe large vocabulary tasks require modelling of the subword units (typically context sensitive\nphone4 ), and stringing them together according to a pronunciation dictionary for the words in\nthe lexicon. Typically the hypothesis space grows too large for an exhaustive search. Various\nhypothesis pruning techniques that remove the unlikely hypothesis from the search space early are\nessential.\n\n2.6\n\nSpeech enhancement\n\nTechniques from this class aim to reduce the statistical difference between clean training and noisy\ntesting features using some apriori knowledge about the speech, the noise and/or the way they\ncombine. All systems today use some of the techniques from this class. Most of them originate\nfrom attempts to improve speech intelligibility. They all introduce a new problem to the robust\nASR as well: the “enhanced” or “cleaned” (because they mostly deal with noise attenuation)\nspeech maybe more intelligible to the humans, but not to the ASR systems. The degradations\noccurring due to “cleaning” are particularly harmful as they are non–linear, unnatural and their\nextent is hard to quantify in advance. On the other side, the present statistical ASR systems\nare quite sensitive to degradations producing data unseen during the training (the problem of\nstatistical “outliers”).\nOne way to limit the damage is to train the ASR system on “cleaned” clean speech so that the\nstatistical models train to handle the degradation. Another possibility is to modify the enhancement process in such a way to balance the enhancement and the degradation of the speech.\nSpeech enhancement is particularly attractive when other ASR system components can not be\nchanged.\n\n2.6.1\n\nSpectral subtraction\n\nSpectral subtraction (SS) is the dominant technique today for cleaning the speech from the additive\nnoise. The prerequisite is that the average noise spectrum can be estimated. This is usually done\nby detecting the most recent non–speech region and estimating the noise spectrum there. Various\nnoise–estimation methods are discussed in section 4.4. The underlying assumption is that the\nnoise will not change abruptly and will be close to its mean during this short period of time. The\nassumed model of the environment is Eq. (2.2) with h(t) = 1:\nx(t) = s(t) + n(t)\n\n(2.9)\n\nSpectral subtraction takes place in the spectral domain, after a short term windowed Fourier\ntransform is applied to the signals (Boll, 1979):\nX(jw) = S(jw) + N (jw)\nPL\n\n(2.10)\n\nwhere X(jw) = k=1 x(k)e−jwk . The magnitude of the estimated clean speech ŝ (the result of\nSS) equals the magnitude of the noisy speech less the average noise magnitude, while the phase is\n4 loosely defined as phoneme–like unit\n\n\fCHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR\n\n12\n\nthe same as the phase of the noisy speech:\nŜ(jw) = [|X(jw)| − E{|N (jw)|}]ejθx (e\n\njw\n\n)\n\n(2.11)\n\nThe noise magnitude is averaged only across the sufficiently silent frames considered to be pure\nnoise because of absence of speech activity (gaps between the words, syllables, pauses, etc). Boll\n(1979) proceeds further with:\n• half wave–rectification of ŝ (setting the negative values to zero, while retaining the positive\nones)\n• residual noise reduction by selecting the smallest magnitude value of the three adjacent\n(across time) values in the same frequency bin where the current amplitude is smaller then\nthe maximal noise residual during the non–speech period\n• additional noise suppression in the periods without speech in the resulting cleaned speech ŝ;\nthe period is classified as such if ŝ is lower then -12 dB\nThe original method was developed for speech enhancement, and after cleaning it proceeds further\nwith speech reconstruction (using the phase of the noisy speech).\nAlthough the original SS operates in magnitude domain, to justify it in a statistical sense\nit should be applied to the power spectral domain. As in Eq. (2.3), under the assumptions that\nspeech and noise are independent and that the short term averages of the noise and cleaned speech\ndescribe their true values sufficiently well, the following holds (Kermorvant, 1999):\n|Ŝ(jw)|2 = |X(jw)|2 − E{|N (jw)|2 }\n\n(2.12)\n\nThe enhanced speech itself suffers from unnatural coloration known as “musical noise”, further\nspeech distortion and some of the noise that was not removed. An extension known as “non–linear\nspectral subtraction” (NSS) introduces several parameters to balance these adverse effects (Berouti\net al., 1979; Lockwood and Boudy, 1991). NSS computes ŝ as:\nD(w) =\n|Ŝ(jw)|2\n\n=\n\nG[|X(jw)|2γ − αE{|N (w)|2γ }]\n(\nD1/γ ,\nif D1/γ > βE{|N (jw)|2 }\nβE{|N (jw)|2 } , otherwise\n\n(2.13)\n\nThe parameters α, β (overestimation factor), γ (the power spectrum exponent) and the gain G\n(normalisation gain introduced to compensate for the distortions caused by γ) are all hand tuned\non small databases to achieve satisfactory results. In the context of an ASR system, the clean\nspeech is itself “cleaned” with NSS to achieve further robustness to the distortions caused by the\ncleaning.\nThe NSS was further extended to include an estimate of the noise variance (in addition to the\nmean) and to operate in the log–spectral domain which is more suited to an ASR system (Xie and\nCampernolle, 1993). The minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator of the cleaned speech\ngiven the noisy speech uses the assumed probability density functions (p.d.f.) of the speech and\nthe noise to estimate directly the cleaned speech in the log–spectrum.\nVariants of SS and combinations with other techniques\nNumerous improvements to the original SS have been proposed over time. Median smoothing\nof the signal after the subtraction was found to reduce the “musical noise” as good as more\ncomplicated schemes without the need for manual tuning of the parameters (Linhard and Klemm,\nŜ(jw)\n1997). Improvements in an intelligibility test have been reported when adapting the gain X(jw)\nrecursively (Linhard and Haulick, 1998). Singh and Srdiharan (1998) found that a critical band\nSS, where the noise spectrum is considered constant in all frequency bins within a critical band,\n\n\fCHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR\n\n13\n\ncan improve the quality of the cleaned speech. Further, Virag (1995) incorporated masking across\ncritical bands (a known property of the human auditory system) into the SS scheme, claiming\nimprovements.\nSpectral subtraction has been successfully integrated into the Parallel Model Combination\n(PMC) approach to model compensation (Flores and Young, 1993). Both the means and the\nvariances of the HMM system ware compensated for the additive noise as well as for the degradation due to SS. Schless and Class (1998) used similar but simpler scheme where the musical noise\nwas balanced with SNR dependent α and β. The SS with masking has been used in conduction\nwith PMC (Drygajlo et al., 1995) as well. Section 2.8.1 discusses the PMC scheme for model\ncompensation in detail.\nIn almost all cases, it is very hard to asses if the improvements reported would generalise to an\nASR system in a particular setup. However, all real–world systems use some variant of spectral\nsubtraction. It is important to use exactly the same SS scheme both during the training (even on\nclean speech) and testing, so that the models can “learn” the distortions introduced by the SS.\n\n2.6.2\n\nWiener filtering\n\nWiener filtering is commonly used as alternative or complementary technique to spectral subtraction for removing additive noise. The filter is designed to minimise the minimum mean square\nerror (MMSE) in time domain and is a maximal likelihood filter if the distributions of the speech\nand the noise are Gaussian. This assumption that the signals are quasi-stationary and distributed\nNormally is common in speech processing (McAulay and Malpass, 1980). Vaseghi and Milner\n(1993, 1997) used a Wiener filter in power spectral domain:\nH(w) =\n\nE{|S(jw)|2 }\nE{|S(jw)|2 } + E{|N (jw)|2 }\n\n(2.14)\n\nThen, the magnitude of the cleaned speech is:\n|Ŝ(jw)| = H(w)|X(jw)|\n\n(2.15)\n\nIf the spectrum was computed from a infinite time series, the Wiener filter would be a particular\ncase of spectral subtraction. However, the mean of the clean speech (in addition to the mean of\nthe noise) is rarely available (except in mock experiments where the clean speech is available).\nTwo possible ways around this are:\n• assuming piecewise stationarity of the speech and independence of the speech and noise, use\nthe mean noisy signal instead of the clean one (Stahl et al., 2000; Agarwal and Cheng, 1999)\n• perform model adaptation instead of speech filtering (Beattie and Young, 1992; Vaseghi and\nMilner, 1993, 1997; Downey, 1996). This is particularly attractive for HMM based systems.\nThe means of the clean speech are readily available as the means of the state p.d.f.s. The\ndistributions are Gaussian (or mixtures of). The quasi-stationarity of the speech is ensured\nat state level.\nVaseghi and Milner (1997) compared Wiener filtering to SS and model adaptation on several\nNOISEX noises and found that Wiener filtering outperformed SS and was close to model adaptation. Downey (1996) reported on isolated digits recognition in car noise where the Wiener filter\noutperformed masking and SS and was as good as PMC.5 .\n\n2.6.3\n\nNoise masking\n\nNoise masking is another commonly used technique for speech enhancement. It’s inspired by\na known effect in the auditory system where stronger signals mask the weaker ones in the sense\n5 parallel model combination, Section 2.8.1\n\n\fCHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR\n\n14\n\nthat the weaker signal is not perceived. This can happen across the neighbouring frequency bands,\nacross time frames, etc. The masking property is exhibited at various levels of the human audition\nchain as well (e.g. in the firing patterns of the neuron’s response (Moore, 1982)). The end result\nis that the masked signal is not perceived. Examples of the effects of noise on the outputs of a\nstandard spectral log–filterbank representation are shown on Figure 3.2. This may be one of the\nmethods for noise suppression that human auditory system uses to enhance the local SNR. Features\nincorporating forward and backward noise masking in time by essentially high–pass filtering the\ncepstral trajectories were found to perform better both in clean and noisy speech then the cepstral\nfeatures alone (Aikawa et al., 1996).\nOne way to simulate the masking property is to detect the frequency bands where the energy\nis below a certain threshold (and thus is believed to belong to the noise), and replace this value by\nthe value of the mask for the subsequent processing (Klatt, 1976). Therefore the variance because\nof the noise is decreased. This was originally implemented in the context of a dynamic–time\nwarping (DTW) recogniser. In the original scheme if the bin in the template or the observation\nare below the noise threshold they are replaced with it in the further calculation.\nBridle et al. (1984) introduced further refinements in the “noise marking” scheme. Depending\non the relation between the observation, the noise mask level and the template mean (or the\nGaussian state p.d.f. in the experiments by Varga and Ponting (1989)), the acoustic match score\nis computed differently for each case.\nHolmes and Sedgwick (1986) used a probabilistic interpretation and extension to a HMM–\nbased recogniser of the masking property. Assuming an environmental M AX model, the energy\nof the speech must be below the energy of the noise when it is masked. Therefore, the noisy bins\nthat have masked the speech can still be used to weight against the models which have significant\nenergy in these bins. Further, a measure of the probability that a state generated the masked\nspeech was introduced: the area below the p.d.f. up to the noisy value. The usage of M AX model\nis motivated by the observation that only in small number of bins the speech and the noise will\nhave comparable energy. In most of the bins, either the speech or the noise will dominate.\nA systematic comparison of the three methods that utilise masking to achieve robustness found\nKlatt’s method advantageous (Varga and Ponting, 1989). The following comparative summary\ndepicts the way the state emission probability is calculated with the proposed methods that utilise\nmasking for robustness:\nCondition\nN <O<µ\nO<N <µ\nO<µ<N\nN <µ<O\nµ<N <O\nµ<O<N\n\nKlatt (1976)\nN (O; µ, σ)\nN (N ; µ, σ)\nN (N ; N, σ)\nN (O; µ, σ)\nN (O; N, σ)\nN (N ; N, σ)\n\nBridle et al.

Mellor and Varga (1993) applied noise masking with MFCC features by masking\nin the spectral domain and subsequently transforming the features. Noise masking was found to\nperform as good as PMC down to 3dB, but worse for lower SNRs, on an isolated digits task.\n\n\fCHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR\n\n2.6.4\n\n15\n\nNoisy–to–clean mapping\n\nAnother idea for achieving robustness is to find some kind of mapping between the noisy and clean\nspeech features. Applying this transformation to the noisy features would yield the clean ones. In\norder to estimate the mapping, both clean and noisy versions of the signal are necessary. Next, the\nform of the functional mapping has to be determined. The choice varies from simple parametric\ntypes like linear regression (Mokbel et al., 1992) to non–parametric non–linear estimators such as\nmulti–layer perceptrons (MLP) (Mokbel et al., 1992; Gao and Haton, 1993; Trompf et al., 1993).\nIn order to optimise the mapping, a function measuring the similarity between the cleaned and\nclean features has to be selected. Typically this is the mean square error (MSE) function. Then\nthe optimisation problem of searching for the parameters of the mapping to minimise the error\ncriterion can be solved with standard optimisation techniques. The choice of techniques is not\nlimited – for example, Kobayashi et al. (1993) employed an iterative procedure (using Wiener\nfilter) for maximisation of posterior probability (MAP) of an all–pole model.\nThe performance of this technique is limited by the assumptions it is based on. It depends\non how the chosen mapping function and error criterion suit a particular noise. So, while on the\nsame type of noise the mapping will yield good results, for different noise types the result can be\nunpredictable.\n\n2.6.5\n\nModel based enhancement\n\nThe model based techniques explicitly assume a certain model of the clean speech and derive its\nparameters from data. During the enhancement process, the noisy speech, constrained by the\nmodel, is modified in such a way as to fit the model better. It is therefore considered enhanced. In\na similar way to the noisy–to-clean mapping in the previous section, the nature of the model and\nthe nature of enhancement determine the process and have to be decided upon beforehand. The\nmain difference from noisy–to-clean mapping is that an explicit model of clean speech is assumed\nand the estimated from the data.\nShort term spectral amplitude MMSE estimation\nEphraim and Malah (1984) derived an MMSE estimator of the short–time spectral amplitude\n(STSA) to enhance speech contaminated with stationary additive noise. The STSA was assumed\nto have normal probability density with mutually independent Fourier coefficients. The estimator\nwas further expanded to encompass the signal presence uncertainty. It was found that the STSA\nestimate can be improved if it is conditioned on the probability of the signal being present or\nabsent. This effectively amounts to switching between two estimators. When the signal is absent\n(noisy operating condition) the noise fills in the silence. The probability of presence/absence of\neach spectral component was assumed independent of the others. The optimal estimator of the\nphase under the same statistical model was derived as well. It was found to have nonunity modulus.\nSo, when combined with the STSA estimator, the resulting estimator is no longer optimal. It was\nalso discovered that the best phase estimator constrained to have modulus of one, is the phase of\nthe noisy signal. This is the reason why the phase of the noisy signal is usually used when the\nenhanced speech is reconstructed.\nSimilar MMSE estimators but for log–spectral (Compernolle, 1989b) and for log–filterbank (Erell\nand Weintraub, 1993a) domain respectively have also been derived. They either require a noise\nmodel (Compernolle, 1989b), or estimate of the conditional distribution of the clean and the noisy\nspeech (Erell and Weintraub, 1993a), in addition to the clean speech model. The assumed combination of speech and noise was the additive model in power spectral domain. The latter method\nwas tested in the context of an HMM system (Erell and Weintraub, 1993b) on the RM task.\nMMSE of log–filterbank features outperformed the one of STSA, and conditioning on the energy\ngave big win for both techniques. All above mentioned estimators were reported to give increased\nASR accuracy over the respective baseline both when training on clean and noisy data.\n\n\fCHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR\n\n16\n\nUsing a–priori speech constraints\nA feature enhancement scheme utilising the morphological constraints was used to compensate the\ncepstral features of the recogniser for the adverse influence of additive noise, stress and Lombard\neffect simultaneously (Hansen, 1994). Both the parameter enhancement and the stress compensation were conditioned on estimated noise mean and variance. The Lombard effect on the feature\nvectors fed to the recogniser was modelled as an additive bias. It was conditioned on the so called\n“stress class”, and was itself modelled as a random Gaussian variable. The limited amount of true\nspeech with Lombard effect was handled by parameter smoothing techniques. With all noises and\nall SNRs significant improvements in performance over the baseline were obtained. Hansen and\nArslan (1995) used an iterative method that assumes an all pole model of speech for enhancement.\nAll constraints were derived from the fact that human articulators are a slowly moving physical\nsystem:\n• the all–pole model has to be stable\n• the poles have to be at certain positions\n• poles can not move too quickly from frame to frame.\nThe linear prediction (LP) model is one of the most commonly used speech models, since there is\na prior knowledge of what the all–pole model of the speech should look like,\nYegnanarayana et al. (1999) introduced the idea of identifying the high SNR regions in the\ntime–frequency plane and amplifying those regions correspondingly (instead of attenuation of the\nlow SNR regions). The identification of the regions is based on the measure of the flatness of the\nLP spectrum. The measure draws from the ratio of energies of the linear predictors residual signal\nof the clean and noisy speech. The same idea was also applied to enhancement of reverberant\nspeech (Yegnanarayana et al., 1999). Instead of SNR, a measure called Signal to Reverberant\ncomponent Ratio (SRR) was optimised. The LP residual is changed depending on the estimated\nSRR to enhance the high SRR regions. In both cases the SNR rather then ASR accuracy was\nmeasured and was reported to improve in additive noise.\nUsing speech HMM for enhancement\nThe speech model need not necessarily be a simple one. Couvreur and Hamme (2000) used an\nHMM to model both the speech and the noise. The forward–backward algorithm was used to\nget the posterior probability of all joint (speech, noise) states to have generated the noisy speech.\nAlternatively, it is possible to find only the most probable sequence with a Viterbi search, taking a\nhard decision for each frame. In either case, Parallel Model Combination (PMC – see Section 2.8.1)\ncan be used to obtain the parameters of the composite model. Once the state sequence or posterior\nprobabilities of the states given the noisy data are known, either a maximum likelihood (ML), or\nmaximum posteriori (MAP) estimate of the clean speech can be generated using state conditioned\nWiener filters. This complex speech model yielded significant improvements both in the quality\nof the enhanced speech and the accuracy of its recognition.\nAn autoregressive HMM (AR–HMM) system was used in the same manner for speech enhancement (Logan and Robinson, 1998). Because of the AR–HMM, the additive property of the speech\nand noise holds in the parameter domain too. So it is easier to derive the parameters of the composite (speech, noise) states. Only Viterbi search (with hard state–to–frame alignment) was used\nto obtain an estimate of the cleaned speech. On a small vocabulary, speaker dependent task, the\ncompensated system trained on clean speech approached the performance of the system trained\non noisy speech.\n\n2.7\n\nRobust features\n\nThe term robust features refers to applying a transformation in the first stage of processing of\nthe speech signal (feature extraction) that will (hopefully) result in similar, if not the same,\n\n\fCHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR\n\n17\n\nfeature vectors both with speech used for training and speech that is to be recognised (Picone,\n1993). Ideally, this should be possible regardless of the source of the variability. Because the\nfeature vectors won’t differ greatly, the subsequent processing will be the same in both cases.\nRobust distance measures may be also employed, as the feature vectors will be “similar”, but not\nthe “same”. The distance measure is usually more important in the systems based on template\nmatching via dynamic time warping (DTW), then for the HMM based ones.\nHernando and Nadeu (1991) found that using autocorrelation of the signal instead of the\nsignal itself to fit an all pole model gives significant performance gain. This was applied together\nwith a distance measure operating in the cepstral domain. In a similarly motivated development,\nin addition to autocorrelation–based features, the autocorrelation feature trajectory was filtered\nwith a high pass filter to suppress the slowly varying components prior to computing the cepstral\ncoefficients through a discrete cosine transform (Yuo and Wang, 1999).\nPaliwal (1998) introduced spectral subbands centroid (SCC) features, and supplement cepstral\nwith SCC features to improve the robustness. The features are related to the formants of the\nspeech, but can be extracted easily and reliably from the power spectrum of the speech signal.\nThe spectrum is divided in small number of sections (3 to 4), and a number of subbands fall into\none section. The SCC feature is computed as:\nR hm\n\nf wm (f )P γ (f )df\nCm = Rlmhm\nwm (f )P γ (f )df\nlm\nwhere lm and hm are the lower and the higher edges of the m-th section of the spectrum, wm (f )\nis the shape of the filter, P (f ) is the power spectrum and γ is a constant controlling the dynamic\nrange of the power spectrum.\nIn another attempt to derive a robust feature extractor, a two–sided linear predictor followed\nby singular value decomposition (SVD) was used to improve the resistance to additive noise (Wong\net al., 1993).\nAll authors reported improvements over the baseline systems. However, it is not clear whether\nintegrating different schemes results in further performance improvements.\n\n2.7.1\n\nCepstral mean normalisation\n\nRemoving the slow variations out of cepstral features can be accomplished via cepstrum mean\nnormalisation (CMN) technique. This simply means calculating the mean of the cepstral features\nover a word or sentence of speech, and removing (subtracting) the value out of the features. An\nalternate strategy is to employ a speech/noise detector and calculate the mean only over the speech\nparts. Subtraction in the cepstral domain removes the effect of convolutional noise on the signal\n(the same is true for log-spectrum, too). Typically this is the impulse response of the microphone.\nThe technique is easy to implement, and effective (Stern et al., 1997). Extension of the technique,\ntermed segmental cepstrum mean normalisation (SCMN) incorporates estimation of the variance\n(in addition to the mean) of each feature, and subsequent feature normalisation using both the\nmean and the variance (Vikki and Laurila, 1997). Because it is very cheap and yet effective, some\nvariant of cepstral normalisation is part of almost every practical ASR system.\n\n2.7.2\n\nPerceptual linear prediction\n\nA special form of linear predictive (LP) analysis (all pole modelling of the power spectrum)\nknown as Perceptual LP (PLP) (Hermansky, 1990) appears to be more effective in obtaining\nnoise resistant features then the ordinary LP. The central idea is to fit the poles to a warped,\nMel–scale spectrum, rather then the linear one. This is in line with with our knowledge about\nhuman audition that not all frequencies are equally important (i.e. carry the same information\ncontent) for ASR. The emphasis is on a better fit at the lower frequencies, to the expense of the\nfit at the higher frequencies. Further, the Mel–scale introduces smoothing at the lower frequencies\n\n\fCHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR\n\n18\n\nreducing the need for the all–pole model to fit the fine structure of the speech (as pitch harmonics)\nthat are unrelated to the vocal tract shape.\nThe technique incorporates two other properties of human hearing in further processing stages:\nthe critical band analysis is followed by equal loudness pre–emphasis (according to the equal\nloudness curve) and intensity–to–loudness conversion (by taking the cubic root) before the LP\ncoefficients are computed. A discrete cosine transform is applied to the LP coefficients to compute\nthe final PLP features.\nPLP of lower order seems to perform same or better then “ordinary” LP of higher order. PLP\nis one of the two (the other being Mel–frequency cepstra) feature extraction frontends in wide use\nin the ASR systems today (Hunt, 1999).\nKryze et al. (1999) replaced the Mel–scale filters with a hierarchical unbalanced tree of low–\nand high–pass filters implementing a discrete wavelet transform to improve noise robustness. The\nresulting transform has adaptive time–frequency resolution. Significant absolute improvement in\nperformance was reported on clean TIMIT data mixed with car noise.\n\n2.7.3\n\nRelative spectra\n\nHermansky and Morgan (1994) devised a representative relative spectra (RASTA) for handling\nslowly varying additive and convolutional noise. The idea is to suppress any components in the\nspeech that change more slowly or quickly then the “typical” range of speech change. As PLP, it\nis loosely inspired by human audition. Human perception tends to respond to a changes of the\nvalue of the input in addition to the absolute value of the input itself.\nThe technique can be used in conjunction with PLP (Hermansky et al., 1991). The spectral\ncomponents that are obtained through the filter bank are compressed and filtered (the trajectory\nof the filter bank output over time is itself filtered) to suppress constant factors in each of them.\nThe last step is all pole model estimation as with PLP. The basic technique, so called lin-log\nRASTA, operates in log-spectral domain. Filtering the constant/slowly varying components in\nthis domain effectively subtracts from the signal the noise convolutional in time domain. The\noriginal IIR filter used was:\nH(z) =\n\n0.2 + 0.1z −1 − 0.1z −3 − 0.2z −4\nz −4 (1 − 0.98z −1 )\n\n(2.16)\n\nThe frequency response of the filter features a sharp zero at 0Hz, suppressing the DC component\n(convolutional noise in the log–spectral domain). The other two zeros are at 28.9 and 50Hz. The\npole at z = 0.98 was latter replaced with pole at z = 0.94.\nHowever, filtering in the log-spectral domain does not compensate for additive (in time domain)\nnoise. After Hirsch et al. (1991) demonstrated that high pass filtering the envelope of the bands\ncan be effective for additive noise removal, RASTA was applied to a linear–like domain for small\nspectral values and a logarithmic–like domain for large spectral values in order to compensate for\nboth types of noise. This variant is known as J-RASTA. The effect is easily achieved by adding\na small constant to the output of the filterbank before the log compression. This amounts to\nnoise masking. Hunt (1999) argued that this is the same as using root–compression nonlinearity\n(for example used in PLP). Both ultimately achieve robustness by training the models with small\namount of added noise.\nIt is notable that the numerator of the filter, 0.2 + 0.1z −1 − 0.1z −3 − 0.2z −4 , is essentially\nthe transfer function of the delta–features calculation (Furui, 1986). Compared to RASTA, these\nfeatures are much more selective in their frequency response. RASTA’s passband is much broader.\nOpenshaw and Mason (1996) performed similar to RASTA filtering in spectral domain instead of\nlog–spectral domain.\nBoth RASTA and RASTA–PLP features appear to be effective with wide range of noises and\nboth with additive and convolutional noise. They have also produced improved performance with\nreverberant speech.\n\n\fCHAPTER 2.

It seems that modulation\nfrequencies below 2 and above 10Hz become less important in noisy speech, while those below\n1Hz significantly degrade the accuracy in noisy environment. Modulation spectrogram captures\ninformation distributed over intervals of syllabic duration (100–250ms). Experiments with a hybrid HMM/MLP system demonstrated that incorporating the syllable length information either\nby using modulation spectrogram features and/or using wider context input window (185ms instead of the usual 105ms) significantly decreased the word error rate (WER) both for clean and\nreverberant speech Wu et al. (1998b).\nThe modulation spectrogram features are computed by analysing speech with a critical-band\nFIR filterbank first. Greenberg and Kingsbury (1997) half–wave rectified each output of the\nfilterbank next, low-pass filtered it with 28Hz cut-off frequency, downsampled 100-fold, normalised\nby its long term average, bandpass filtered so that only the modulation frequencies between 0\nand 8kHz pass through, limited with dynamic range limiter of peak 30dB and smoothed with\nbilinear transform at the end. Wu et al. (1998b) used a variant where the envelopes of the\nquarter–octave FIR filterbank outputs where low–pass filtered, downsampled, then low–pass and\nband–pass filtered, compressed with cubic–root compression and normalised with their global peak\n(Figure 2.3).\nImprovements were demonstrated on reverberant speech. On a large vocabulary ASR task\nmodulation spectrogram features have been found to carry complementary (to the PLP features)\ninformation enhancing the performance (Robinson et al., 2000).\n6 in the latter paper DFT instead of filterbank is used\n\n\fCHAPTER 2.

Derivatives can remove slowly changing convolutive noise when applied in log-spectral\nor cepstral domain; the same is true for additive noise with the derivatives applied in spectral\ndomain. The derivatives of the “static” features are calculated either via simple difference, or via\nregression (Furui, 1986). Those regression features are part of almost all ASR systems today:\nPN\nnx(t − n)\n∆x(t) = n=−N\n(2.17)\nPN\n2\nn=−N n\nThe difference and the regression dynamic features can be of the first, second or higher orders.\nRegression derivatives of 1st, 2nd and 3rd order have been found to increase the robustness of the\nmodels trained on cleaned speech and tested on Lombard speech (Hanson and Applebaum, 1990).\nInterestingly, inclusion of the static features neither improved nor hindered the performance. Since\neach additional set of derivatives significantly increases the feature vector dimensionality, and some\nof them are correlated, PCA can be used to truncate the feature vector by removing the redundant\nfeatures (Trompf et al., 1993).\nHirsch et al. (1991) found that high pass filtering of the trajectories of the log–filterbank\nfeatures features increased performance both in clean and noisy conditions. A simple IIR filter\nwas used:\ny(n) = x(n) − x(n − 1) + 0.7y(n − 1)\n(2.18)\nIn a more general approach, features extracted from a full two dimensional Mel–cepstrum\n(TDMC) were used to increase the performance in clean and in noisy speech (Kitamura et al.,\n1992; Milner, 1996). TDMC is defined as a two-dimensional Fourier transform of Mel–scaled log\nspectra in the frequency and time domains. The ways of selecting an appropriate subset of TDMC\nfeatures is also discussed in these papers.\nMore data–driven approaches have been applied recently to the task of filtering the time trajectories of the spectral parameters (Nadeu et al., 1997; Avendano and Hermansky, 1997). Nadeu\net al. (1997) designed optimal filters for the time trajectories suited to a particular task/speech\ndatabase. The derived filters tend to support the claim of the importance of the modulation frequencies around the syllable rate (3Hz on the database that was used). Avendano and Hermansky\n(1997) designed filters for speech enhancement. The criterion for optimal mapping was MMSE,\nand clean and noisy speech at various SNRs from the TIMIT database were used to derive the\nfilters. It was found that:\n• the filters for high SNRs were quite flat\n• the filters for mid SNRs were band–pass, enhancing the modulation frequency of around 5Hz\n• at low SNRs, the filters were low gain, low cut–off frequency and low–pass\n\n2.7.6\n\nFeature normalisation\n\nTibrewala and Hermansky (1998); Hakkinen et al. (1999) reported on a simple technique of on–line\nnormalisation of feature mean and variance, effective with a wide range of noises. The statistical\nmodels of the today’s ASR systems on average perform better if fed with features with roughly the\nsame means (preferably 0) and variances (preferably 1). It is computationally cheap to normalise\nthem with a first order recursion:\nµ(t)\n\n= αµ(t − 1) + (1 − α)x(t)\n\ns(t) = αs(t − 1) + (1 − α)x2 (t)\nσ 2 (t) = s(t) − µ2 (t)\nx(t) − µ(t)\nx̄(t) =\nσ(t)\n\n(2.19)\n\n\fCHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR\n\n21\n\nwhere x(t) is the feature that is used for recognition (filterbank energy, cepstral coefficient, LP\ncoefficient) and x̄ is the “normalised” feature fed in the recogniser. A typical value for α is\nα = 0.995. The transformation is applied to each feature independently.\nTibrewala and Hermansky (1998) reported 75% decrease in word error rate on the task of\nrecognising isolated digits with a wide range of noises. At low SNRs it was found that both\nthe mean and the variance normalisation contribute equally to the improvement. At high SNRs\nnormalising the mean alone was enough to achieve the improved performance.\n\n2.7.7\n\nSpectral peaks\n\nWhile studying highly distorted sine–wave speech (SWS), (Barker and Cooke, 1997; Barker, 1998)\nused spectral peaks for robust speech recognition. SWS is speech produced by time varying sinusoids mimicking the amplitude and frequency variation of the first three formants. Tests on the\nResource Management (RM) corpus showed improvement when peaks were used in recognition,\nregardless whether they were used during training.\nDecrease of WER on a discrete–word recognition task was also reported when position and\nmotion of the dominant spectral peaks were incorporated into a conventional Hidden Markov\nModel (HMM) based system (Strope and Alwan, 1998). The system detects peaks on the outputs\nof auditory filters with automatic gain control (AGC), groups them together into threads and\nsmoothes the trajectory by fitting it into a second order polynomial. Again, peaks (and their\nderivatives) were used together with other features (cepstral coefficients and their derivatives).\nIt is regularly observed that the spectral peaks are less affected by noise then the “valleys”\nthat fill with noise. Figure 2.4 shows smoothed spectrogram–like features on the left panels in\nclean condition (a), 20dB factory noise (b) and 0dB (c). On the middle panels (d), (e) and (f)\nare the corresponding spectral peaks features. It is notable that they change much less then the\nwhole spectrum. However, many spurious peaks arise as the SNR decreases. This is due to the\ndefinition of a spectral peak employed here: in each frame, channels with energy higher then their\nneighbouring channels are marked to contain a spectral peak (Barker, 1998). The right panels\n(g), (h) and (i) show three exemplary spectral slices of the clean speech (the black line), the 20dB\n(green line) and the 0dB noisy speech (the blue line). As the SNR decreases, the spectral peaks\nare the last to be covered with noise.\n\n2.7.8\n\nAuditory motivated robust features\n\nSince human audition is so robust to noise, many researchers have tried to replicate the better\nknown parts of the human auditory chain in hope of achieving robustness.\nThe Ensemble Interval Histogram (EIH) (Ghitza, 1986) features were derived from a computational model of the auditory nerve–fibre firing pattern. There are 85 cochlear filters followed by\nlevel crossing counters over a finite time interval. The representation preserves fine spectral detail\nin low–frequency regions and fast time response in the high–frequency regions. It was compared\nto, and found to be more robust than an FFT derived frontend.\nHunke et al. (1998) used an auditory frontend of 120 FIR filters with frequency response\nderived from the solution of a 3-D cochlear hydrodynamic model. Similarly to the modulation\nspectrogram, the model (among other things) encompasses an automatic gain control (AGC),\nsaturation of the magnitude at 30dB and downsampling to the rate of 100Hz so that it can be\nused as a plug-in replacement for a standard ASR frontend. The robustness was compared with\nMFCC, RASTA and J-RASTA and was significantly better (especially at lower SNRs) with the\nmajority of the noises.\nTian et al. (1998) took a similar approach with a frontend that consisted of: FFT, intensity\nto loudness conversion and equal loudness correction, Mel–scaling and loudness–to–firing rate\nconversion. The model of Dobrin et al. (1995) went further by feeding the firing rate into a model\nof the central auditory system for recognition of isolated words. Gao et al. (1992) incorporated\na feedback block to simulate the efferent–induced depression of the basilar membrane motion in\naddition to the (more or less) standard model of auditory periphery.

The frequency and the laterality are the two dimensions\nof the representation. In addition, temporal integration takes place in each point in the plane,\neffectively adding a half dimension. The neural activity is buffered and when large peak is detected,\nit is added pointwise to the previous pattern stored in a static buffer. The integration stabilises\nperiodic patterns.\nPerdigao and Sa (1998) compared several auditory models with the commonly used features\n(RASTA, J-RASTA, MFCC, LPC) on a common task of isolated digits recognition. Almost\nall of the proposed auditory motivated features perform better then the “conventional” MFCC\nfrontend7 , and especially in noise.\nHowever, it seems that the consensus between the speech technologists is that the drawbacks of\nthe auditory inspired models outweigh their gains and none are widely used in the practical ASR\nsystems. For example, the AIM model generates 10000 features per frame – 3 orders of magnitude\nmore then the MFCC frontend. A more general problem with the auditory features is that they\nare all fairly redundant and mutually dependent. The present statistical ASR systems are better\nsuited to compact and independent feature representations.

A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR\n\n23\n\nfeatures as possible reduces the number of parameters of the system thus reducing the amount\nof training data needed. Further, although all are derived from the knowledge gathered while\nexploring the human auditory system, application of the auditory models usually requires tuning\nof a significant number of parameters.\n\n2.8\n\nModel adaptation\n\nTechniques from this group aim to compensate the mismatch between the training and the testing\nconditions by suitably modifying the parameters of the models. Usually, researchers strive to\nmake the new model parameters same or similar enough to the parameters that would have been\nestimated if all training data was spoken in the particular noisy condition that the recogniser\nis decoding at the moment. With rare exceptions, almost all techniques try to compensate for\nadditive and/or convolutional noise, disregarding the Lombard effect. The speech is assumed to be\nindependent of the noise. Therefore, the speech and the noise models can be inferred separately,\nmaking the techniques from this group very attractive. When the noise source changes, only the\nnew noise model needs to be trained. This approach fits well the HMM based systems where the\nphysical meaning of the parameters is well understood.\nThere are two unknown factors in the process: the statistical distribution of the noise, and\nhow the speech and the noise combine to give the noisy observation.\nThe noise can be either known in advance, or it can be estimated on–line from the noisy speech.\nIf it is known in advance, it can be modelled just as the speech is. For a fairly stationary noise,\na single state model would suffice. For more complicated noises, a two state model has to be\nestimated. Noises requiring more then two states are rarely utilised in laboratory tests. On–line\nnoise estimation is more attractive as in theory it adapts the recogniser to the noise at recognition\ntime, accommodating for noises unknown at training time. However, it is much harder and less\nsuccessful then off–line noise estimation. It is typically achieved with some sort of speech activity\ndetector. Noise is estimated during the speech pauses. It is implicitly assumed that the noise will\nbe fairly stationary and will not change significantly until the next pause. Usually only simple\n(mono–state) noises are estimated this way. Section 4.4 reviews various on–line noise estimation\ntechniques in more detail.\nRose et al. (1994) treated the problems in combining the known speech and noise models\nto obtain a noisy model with very general acoustic environment functions (governing how the\nspeech and noise combine together to produce the noisy speech) in detail. Specific examples,\nwith functions like additivity in the spectral domain, additivity in log–spectral domain and the\nmaximum in log–spectral domain were considered.\nThe model of the acoustic environment that is most commonly used is Eq. (2.2). It naturally\narises from the physics of the sound. However, it is not the only one. For the purposes of spectral\nsubtraction in magnitude domain additivity in the spectral magnitude domain has been assumed\n(Section 2.6.1). It has also been noticed that in the log–spectral domain, for the case of additive\nnoise, the M AX approximation (observed speech being maximum of the speech and the noise)\nholds pretty well and simplifies the speech and noise combination (Nadas et al., 1989; Rose et al.,\n1994; Varga and Moore, 1990; Holmes and Sedgwick, 1986; Gales, 1997). This model and its\nimplications will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 3.\nIn many approaches there is not a strict divide between model and feature compensation.\nSince the parameters of the used models (notably HMMs with Gaussian functions for state p.d.f.)\nhave straightforward interpretation in relation to the features (i.e. they are the means and the\nvariances of the features), the computed compensation factors can be applied in the feature, as\nwell as in the parameter domain (Moreno, 1996; Beattie and Young, 1992; Vaseghi and Milner,\n1993; Downey, 1996).\n\n\fCHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR\n\n2.8.1\n\n24\n\nParallel model combination\n\nParallel model combination (PMC) (Gales, 1995) is a popular technique for compensation of the\neffects both of additive and convolutional noise. The noise has to be known in advance (this is\nmore often the case), or estimated on–line. The means alone, or the means and the variances of\nthe speech models can be compensated. The technique allows for compensation of the mixture\nweights (in the iterative version) as well as the number of mixtures (but this is rarely used).\nThe assumed acoustic environment model is Eq. (2.2). Since the equations involved don’t have\na closed form solution, there are several PMC variants depending on the assumptions made in\norder to obtain an approximate solution. We will consider the case of PMC in additive noise. The\nconvolutive noise in spectral domain amounts to additive noise in the log–spectral (and cepstral\ndomain). If both the speech and the noise are distributed normally, their sum is going to be\ndistributed normally, too, and the compensation is straightforward. The only inconvenience is\nwhen both are modelled with Gaussian mixtures. Then the number of noisy mixtures for the\nnoisy speech is going to be a product of the numbers of mixtures of the speech and the noise\nmodels. Fortunately, a single Gaussian is usually sufficient to model the noise.\nThe simplest case of PMC with additive noise is when both the speech and the noise are single\nGaussians. The non–iterative PMC assumes that the distribution of the corrupted speech is going\nto be Gaussian, too8 , and that the maximal likelihood state alignment (in clean speech) obtainable\nvia Viterbi search is not going to change because of the noise.\nIf the feature parameters are cepstral, then models parameters (means and variances) have to\nbe mapped back to log–linear domain (superscript cep denotes cepstral, log log–spectral and lin\nspectral domain, and subscript pmc denotes the compensated speech parameters, s clean speech\nparameters and n noise parameters):\nµlog\nΣlog\n\n=\n=\n\nC −1 µcep\nC −1 Σcep (C −1 )T\n\n(2.20)\n\nwhere C is the discrete cosine transform (DCT) matrix with Ci,j = cos(i(j − 0.5)π/B) (B is the\nnumber of filterbank channels). Since usually less then B cepstral coefficients are retained, there\nare not enough to correctly reconstruct the log–spectral parameters. Zeros are appended instead,\nwith small loss in accuracy (the higher cepstral coefficients are truncated because they carry little\ninformation useful for ASR).\nOne possibility for evaluation of the moments of the noisy speech distribution is via numerical\nintegration. The compensated mean in the log domain can be estimated as:\nlog\nµlog\n+ E{log(exp(slog ) + exp(nlog ))}\npmc = µ\n\n(2.21)\n\nOne efficient approximation is shown in (Gales, 1995).\nAnother possibility is to assume that the sum of two log–normally distributed random variables\nis a random variable log–normally distributed itself. In that case (Gales, 1995):\nµlin\npmc\n\nlin\n= µlin\ns + µn\n\nΣlin\npmc\n\nlin\n= Σlin\ns + Σn\n\n(2.22)\n\nThen the compensated parameters in the log–spectral domain are:\nµlog\npmc,i\n\n=\n\nlog(µlin\npmc,i ) − 0.5 log(\n\nΣlog\npmc,ij\n\n=\n\nlog(\n\nΣlin\npmc,ii\n2\n(µlin\npmc,i )\n\n+ 1)\n\nΣlin\npmc,ij\n+ 1)\nlin\nµpmc,i µlin\npmc,j\n\n(2.23)\n\nThe third possibility is to ignore the variance of the speech as well as the noise and straightforwardly compensate the mean:\nlog\nlog\nµlog\npmc = log(exp(µs ) + exp(µn ))\n8 This is a poor assumption as it is most often bimodal (Gales, 1995; Moreno, 1996)\n\n(2.24)\n\n\fCHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR\n\n25\n\nstraight through speech HMM\n\nergodic noise HMM\n\nx\n\n=\n\ncomposite HMM\n\nFigure 2.5: Composition of models\nOnce compensated, log–spectral parameters are mapped into the cepstral domain with:\nµcep\npmc\n\n=\n\nCµlog\npmc\n\nΣcep\npmc\n\n=\n\nT\nCΣlog\npmc C\n\n(2.25)\n\nThose parameters are used for recognition of the noisy speech.\nThe non–iterative PMC is fast and efficient. It has been extended to compensate multiple Gaussian mixtures per state (Yang and Haavisto, 1995) and simple (Gales, 1995) or more complex (Yang\net al., 1995; Crafa et al., 1998) dynamic parameters (differences or regression parameters) of the\nfirst and second order. For the cases where a multistate noise model is required, the speech and\nthe noise models can be concatenated into a composite speech–noise model (Fig. 2.5) (Martin,\n1993).\nThe iterative PMC version (Gales, 1995) doesn’t assume a single maximum likelihood alignment that is not going to change. Instead, much like in the Baum–Welch HMM training, each\nfeature vector can be generated by every state with a certain probability. Thus, the assumption\nabout one–to–one mapping between the clean and the noisy speech Gaussians in the mixture\nis relaxed, and a maximum likelihood fit for the Gaussian mixture given the noisy data can be\nsought9 . Therefore the modelling capability is greatly improved. The problem of having no closed\nform solution for the compensation equations is exaggerated here since the numerical solution can\nnot be used – it would involve computationally costly multidimensional integration. Data–driven\nPMC (DPMC) (Gales, 1995) circumvents the problem by drawing (generating) sufficient number\nof clean speech and noise samples from their respective distributions, combining these two sets\nwith the assumed model of acoustic environment, and then using the noisy samples for a standard\nML estimate of the parameters of the state p.d.f. Gaussian mixture. Crafa et al. (1998) introduced a Bayesian variant of DPMC which relies on a prior general noisy speech model. It uses\na weighted combination of the means (and variances) of the apriori general noisy speech model\n(trained on speech with added noise) and the means (and variances) estimated via DPMC. The\nadvantage is that less samples need to be drawn via DPMC in this case (for the same accuracy in\nnoisy distribution estimation).\nThere have been number of extensions and applications of the basic technique to different ASR\nsystems setups. Docio-Frnandez and Garcia-Mateo (1998) addressed the problem of lack of enough\n9 usually the noisy speech distribution retains the same number of mixtures as the clean speech for practical\nreasons\n\n\fCHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR\n\n26\n\ndata for robust estimate of the noise model. A library of noises in the form of Gaussian mixtures\nwas trained off–line. In the two variants of the method, either the on–line noise data was used to\nselect a few of the Gaussians from the library with the highest posterior probabilities, or, the library\n“model” (in the form of single mixtures–single states with ergodic “grammar”) was incorporated\ninto the Viterbi search like a model to be matched in the beginning of each sentence. Flores and\nYoung (1993) compensated the distortion of the speech caused by non–linear SS within the PMC\nframework. Plain SS has been used in conjunction with PMC (Schless and Class, 1998), as well as\nSS with parameters adapted according to the auditory noise masking thresholds (Drygajlo et al.,\n1995). Selective PMC compensation, where only the unreliable features with local SNR (estimated\nvie spectral subtraction) below a certain threshold were compensated was shown to perform better\nthen plain PMC in a noisy digit recognition task (Renevey and Drygajlo, 1999).\n\n2.8.2\n\nHMM decomposition\n\nHMM decomposition (Varga and Moore, 1990) is a general technique for simultaneous recognition\nof any number of signal sources modelled with a discrete state space model. It is a Viterbi search\nthrough the expanded joint N–dimensional state space of all N models. Figure 2.6 illustrates the\nsearch for the case of two sources. The “recogniser” Eq. (2.8) can in this case be expanded as:\n(W 10 , W 20 ) = argmaxP (W 1, W 2|O) = argmaxP (O|W 1, W 2)P (W 1, W 2)\n(W 1,W 2)\n\n(2.26)\n\n(W 1,W 2)\n\nIn each joint state in the expanded space the probability of a particular observation10 (observed\nin that frame) has to be computed. The computation depends on the function of the acoustic\nenvironment, that governs how the sources combine together to produce the single observation.\nFor example, if the assumed environment is Eq. (2.2), the joint distribution of combined state\ncan be obtained via PMC. For a general “mixing operator” ⊗ the probability of observation O\nis (Varga and Moore, 1991) (the subscript denotes the source number):\nI\nP1 ⊗ P2 (O) =\nP (O1 , O2 )\n(2.27)\nC\n\nwhere C is the contour of all couples (O1 , O2 ) such that O = O1 ⊗ O2 .\nIt has already been noted that in the case of a log–filterbank features and additive noise model\nin the spectral domain the max operator is a good approximation (Holmes and Sedgwick, 1986;\nNadas et al., 1989). Because of the compression the log function exhibits, it can be approximated\nwith: log(O1 + O2 ) ≈ log(max{O1 , O2 }). Therefore for model decomposition (Varga and Moore,\n1991):\nP (O) =\n=\n\nP (max{O1 , O2 }) = P (O1 < O2 )P (O2 ) + P (O2 < O1 )P (O1 )\nC(O2 , µ1 , σ1 )N (O2 , µ2 , σ2 ) + C(O1 , µ2 , σ2 )N (O1 , µ1 , σ1 )\n\n(2.28)\n\nwhere N (O, µ, σ) is the Normal distribution and C(O, µ, σ) is the cumulative probability function\nRO\nof the normal distribution −∞ N (x, µ, σ)dx.\nKadirkamanathan (1992) tested the max operator and two alternatives: a three piece linear approximation and non–iterative PMC with log–normal approximation (Eqs. (2.22) and (2.23)) (Gales\nand Young, 1992). They were compared on an isolated digits recognition task with artificially\nadded noise. It was concluded that the three piece approximation performed somewhat better\nthen the max operator, and that the PMC adaptation offered no advantage, especially at lower\nSNRs. The model (de)composition technique is a general search for the most likely explanation\nwhen multiple concurrent independent processes influence the observation. Takiguchi et al. (2000)\nused the technique to model different acoustic transfer functions arising when the speaker is in\nvarious positions relative to the microphone. Three positions were considered, and were assigned\n10 can be naturally expanded to handle multiple observations, as well\n\n\fCHAPTER 2.

The recognition was carried out with model decomposition,\nexplaining the observed acoustics in terms of the words uttered and the position of the speaker.\nModel decomposition can be used to infer both the speech and the noise model from speech\ncontaminated with noise. The only hurdle is that the training is much slower because of the\ncombined models space. The ML formulae for the forward–backward algorithm have been derived\nrepeatedly by Kadirkamanathan and Varga (1991) and Graciarena (2000). Both used the M AX\nenvironmental model. Kadirkamanathan and Varga (1991) experimented with multistate noise\nmodels and found that much of the data is explained by the noise, making the speech models\nsharper. Graciarena (2000) experimented with a single state noise model and noted an improvement, over using a clean speech model together with noise model derived from manually selected\n“noise only” portions of the database.\nAlthough it has not been attempted (because the combined models space expands exponentially\nwith the number of models involved, and so does the computational cost), it is possible to infer\nmodels that explain the observations in multiple dimensions like speech (the words spoken), gender,\nspeaking rate, distance and direction to the microphone, etc. Any number of sources of variability\ncan be thrown in. The mixing function on a state level must be chosen appropriately to explain\nhow they combine to produce the observed data. The sources of variability could be “peeled off”\nfrom the observations this way, instead of bundled together. This may result not only in sharper\nmodels, but in extraction of models that can be combined independently to match the conditions\nduring the recognition (e.g. gender, speaking rate, etc.).\n\n2.8.3\n\nThe RATZ and STAR family of algorithms\n\nThe Multivariate–Gaussian–Based Cepstral Normalisation (RATZ) Statistical Reestimation (STAR)\n(Moreno, 1996; Stern et al., 1996) algorithms refer to the same idea applied in features space\n(RATZ) or in the models space (STAR). The assumed acoustic environment model is Eq. (2.2).\nIt is rewritten as:\nx = s + g(s, h, n)\n(2.29)\n\n\fCHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR\n\n28\n\nwhere\ng(s, h, n) = h + 10 log10 (1 + 10\n\nn−s−h\n10\n\n)\n\n(2.30)\n\nis the additive environmental bias, and x, s, h, n are the noisy speech, the clean speech, the convolutive noise and the additive noise in the log–power domain. It is assumed that the distribution of\nthe noisy speech is Gaussian, and the mean and the variance of its distribution can be expressed\nas (Moreno, 1996):\nµx\nΣx\n\n= µs + E{g(s, h, n)}\n= Σs + µs µTs + E{g(s, h, n)g(s, h, n)T } + E{s g(s, h, n)T } − µx µTx\n\n(2.31)\n\nBoth compensated parameters can be expressed as a sum of the parameters of the clean speech\ndistribution plus correction factors. Since there are no closed form solutions, the distributions\nof the noises h and n are assumed to be Gaussian and independent too. Then the integrals are\napproximately computed by drawing sufficient number of samples from the speech and the noise(s)\ndistributions (i.e. using Monte–Carlo methods, the same way as DPMC in Section 2.8.1).\nThe correction factors are computed for each Gaussian in an HMM system with Gaussian\nmixtures as state p.d.f.s. The number of the Gaussians and their apriori probabilities (the mixture\nweights) stay the same. If a stereo (paired clean and noisy) data is available, the correction factors\ncan be computed directly by using the state/frame aligned data. Without stereo data, when it is\nnot known which state generated which frame, an iterative Expectation Maximisation algorithm\nis derived and utilised.\nAfter the correction factors are found, the hypothesised distribution of the noisy speech is fully\nknown. STAR then proceeds with the recognition of the noisy speech. RATZ compensates the\nfeature vectors, therefore, it has derive a single estimate ŝ of the clean speech s when the noisy\none x is observed. It was chosen to obtain the MMSE estimate ŝMMSE = E{s|x}.\nIn addition to blind and stereo variants of RATZ and STAR, there are also several other variants\nlike interpolated, SNR dependent, etc, differing in the amount of the assumed prior knowledge\nabout the acoustic environment.\n\n2.8.4\n\nPolynomial approximation of the acoustic environment function\n\nThe intractability of the non–linear mismatch function (Eq. (2.30)) between the clean and the noisy\nspeech in the “usual” model of the acoustic environment (Eq. (2.2)) was the reason for employing\nvarious approximations and numerical simulations to calculate the distribution of the degraded\nspeech. Another way to tackle the evaluation problem is to use a polynomial series expansion of\nthe mismatch function (Eq. (2.30)) close to the points of interest, thus easing the computation\nof the noisy speech distribution while retaining reasonable accuracy of approximation (Moreno,\n1996; Kim et al., 1998; Raj et al., 1997).11\nMoreno (1996) carried out a Vector Taylor series compensation (VTS) in the log–power domain\nusing first and second order expansion. The vector Taylor series approximation of the mismatch\nfunction in the neighbourhood of s0 is (Moreno, 1996):\ng(s, h, n) ≈ g(s0 , h, n) + g0 (s0 , h, n)(s − s0 ) +\n\n1 00\ng (s0 , h, n)(s − s0 )2 + . . .\n2\n\n(2.32)\n\nwhere the first derivative of the vector function g(s, h, n) with respect to the vector s evaluated at\ns0 is a diagonal matrix, the second derivative is a diagonal 3-D tensor, etc... In the “blind” case\nthe adaptation has to be iterated in EM fashion since the state/frame alignment is not known in\nadvance.\nRaj et al. (1997) estimated the moments of the noisy speech similarly to VTS, and then these\nmoments are used to fit a straight line approximation of the environment function in a method\ncalled Vector Polynomial Approximations (VPS). In addition to model compensation, it was also\nused for speech enhancement – the MMSE estimate of the clean speech given the noisy speech\n11 Couvreur and Hamme (2000) used the same technique in the context of model–base speech enhancement\n\n\fCHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR\n\n29\n\nand its (derived by compensation) distribution was calculated. Kim et al. (1998) applied the\ntechnique in cepstral domain. First order blind VTS with assumed constant convolutional noise h\nand normally distributed additive noise n was tested on isolated and connected word recognition\ntask with artificially added white car noise at various SNRs. It was found to perform better then\nPMC with log–normal approximation, especially at lower SNRs.\n\n2.8.5\n\nStochastic matching based methods\n\nIt has already been mentioned in the Sections 2.8.1, 2.8.3 and 2.8.4 that in the “blind” case, when\nno state/frame aligned data is available, one can resort to iterative model/state alignment followed\nby parameter reestimation. This was termed stochastic matching by Shankar and Lee (1995). It\nis a general technique applicable with any (assumed) model of the acoustic environment. This\nmodel need not have a physical meaning (like Eq. (2.2)), but merely a convenient form to allow for\nderivation of the update formulas for the unknown parameters. One of most popular forms (due\nto its simplicity) for a mismatch function is the linear regression function (Shankar and Lee, 1995;\nSiohan et al., 1995). Other functions that have been used include projection–based likelihood\nmeasure (Chien et al., 1998) as well as various non–linear functions (Wong and Shi, 1998).\nThis method is widely used for speaker adaptation, i.e. modification of the models to model\nthe current speaker better. Usually, a small amount of speaker dependent (SD) data is available\nand the task is to adapt the speaker independent (SI) models using the SD data. In addition\nto maximising the likelihood (ML criterion), other criteria can be optimised like the maximum\nposteriori probability (MAP) or the minimal classification error (MCE).\nIn general, the methods from this class tend to be used in addition to other noise robustness\nmeasures, rather then on their own.\n\n2.8.6\n\nDiscriminative training\n\nIt is possible to improve the robustness of the recogniser by improving the discrimination between\nthe units/models of the recogniser. This is typically achieved by discriminative training (Mizuta\nand Nakajima, 1992). Since in mismatched conditions the observations are “outliers” to (not drawn\nfrom) the original speech distribution, one way to limit the damage is to make the borders between\nunits/models as wide as possible to decrease the possibility of misrecognition. The discriminative\ntraining objective function not only increases the likelihood of the correct classification, but also\ndecreases the probability of misclassification. The optimisation method is usually some form of\nGeneralised Probabilistic Descent (GPD) on the error function. Chu and Zhao (1998) paired discriminative training with a SNR dependent weighting of the dynamic features. Merhav and Lee\n(1993) explicitly assessed the sensitivity of the models to the conditions mismatch through a generalised likelihood ratio test. This test asymptotically achieves exponentially decaying probability\nof error for the worst–case mismatch condition.\nThe discriminative training aims to achieve maximal a–priori (before any noise is seen) robustness to mismatched conditions and it can be easily complemented with other techniques for\nimproving the robustness to noise.\n\n2.9\n\nCombinations of techniques in real systems\n\nIn real–world applications different techniques are usually combined in the same system to achieve\nmaximal effect.\nMokbel et al. (1997) used several techniques at different levels of the recognition process in an\nASR system for telephone speech (mobile and fixed). In the feature space:\n• cepstral normalisation was used to remove the long term channel effects\n• cepstral feature trajectories were high pass filtered\n\n\fCHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR\n\n30\n\n• adaptive filtering implementing blind equalisation in the frequency domain was employed to\nminimise the MSE between the long term spectrum of the speech coming to the recogniser\nand the “typical” long term spectrum of the speech\n• spectral subtraction was carried out as a next step in the chain to remove the additive noise\nAn on–line noise estimate was (re)estimated during the speech pauses. For this purpose, a five\nstate model (silence, speech presumption, speech, plosive or silence, possible speech continuation)\nwith transitions conditioned on the ratio between the short– and long–term frame energy was\nused. An end–point detector was also employed to ease the dialog management. The HMM model\nparameters were adapted as well. The optimisation criterion was MAP, alleviating the problem of\ninsufficient adaptation data. The mapping from the original to the compensated models space was\nlinear regression. The lack of adaptation data was further handled by clustering the Gaussians of\nthe distributions to use the same data. At the higher level, several garbage models were trained\non non–speech and out–of–vocabulary speech data. Significant performance gains were reported,\nmaking the system operate on both land and cellular phone lines speech.\nSimilarly, Compernolle (1989a) used spectral subtraction and automatic gain control. The\nnoise estimator used histograms based (see Section 4.4 in Chapter 4) speech/noise discriminator.\nA small amount of noise was also used to mask the environment–dependent residuals. Spectral\nsubtraction and thresholding (effectively masking), noise robust acoustic representation and noise–\nrobust spectral distortion measures were used in (Bateman et al., 1992). RASTA filtered cepstral–\ntime matrices and garbage models improved the performance of a telephone based system for town\nnames recognition (Azzopardi et al., 1998). Spectral subtraction, features based on autocorrelation\nand spectral shaping, multiple microphones for spectrum equalisation and multiple models were\nused in a ASR system for car environment (Nakamura et al., 1993).\nIn all cases, the error rates have dropped, as expected. However, no end–user studies have\nbeen reported on how the techniques affect the usability of the automated systems in challenging\nconditions, and whether the systems actually achieve a satisfactory level of performance.\n\n2.10\n\nSummary\n\nA variety of techniques aimed at increasing the robustness of the ASR systems in noisy conditions\nwere reviewed in this chapter. In all cases the techniques employed alleviate the corruptive influence of the environment on the system performance, but rarely manage to bring it to the level\nof performance achieved in good conditions. Table A.1 in Appendix A is an incomplete list of\nimprovements in the accuracy of various ASR systems with proposed techniques for robust ASR.\nWe are far from a comprehensive framework that would encompass and account for all the\nsources of speech variability in the real–life applications. The present methods also suffer from a\nvariety of problems:\n• model based schemes rarely compensate all parameters due to lack of data and computational\ncosts;\n• incorporating the noise variance in the models increases their variance and decreases the\ndiscriminability;\n• feature compensation techniques lack the benefit of piecewise stationarity imposed by the\nmodels;\n• the “inherently robust” features are robust to some noises and much less robust to others;\n• the prevailing cepstral features tend to smear the noise (which in most cases is quite localised\nin the time–frequency plane) over all features in the feature vector.\nIt seems that although the robustness of the recogniser does improve when one or more of the\nabove reviewed techniques are incorporated in it, the level of performance is not good enough for\n\n\fCHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR\n\n31\n\nmany (envisaged) applications, and at present it is at least two orders of magnitude worse then\nwhat humans achieve in the same conditions (Lippmann, 1996).\n\n\fChapter 3\n\nMissing data in speech processing\n3.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn this chapter the idea that parts of the speech spectrum may be obscured by sounds from other\nsources will be discussed. Arguments supporting the idea from various sources will be put forward.\nIt will be argued that the recognition should be performed in two distinct steps: (a) grouping of\nthe evidence coming from the speech source of interest; and (b) adaptation of the recogniser to\nhandle the partial speech. Techniques for pattern classification that enable the adaptation of the\nstatistical systems will be reviewed, and their merits for this purpose assessed. Toward the end,\nprevious studies of using the missing data approach to robust speech and speaker recognition will\nbe reviewed, and relations to similar techniques highlighted.\n\n3.2\n\nMotivation\n\nThe claim that parts of the speech can be obscured and not observable is fairly unintuitive. A\nsimilar claim for vision is much more natural because most visual objects are opaque. Objects\nin the near field of vision regularly hide far field objects from our view. Yet we have no problem\nobserving their existence when they are only partially visible. However, when it comes to speech,\nour intuition suggests that the effect of the sound scene must be additive. After all, the physics of\nsound make it so. Techniques like blind source separation (Section 4.3) that rely on this assumption\nhave demonstrated sound separation when their preconditions are satisfied. However, it is known\nthat in the human auditory system the louder sounds obscure the quieter ones. This happens\nat several levels, effectively removing the quieter sounds from the subsequent processing stages.\nThus, for the purpose of hearing they are lost. We support this claim by several arguments:\n(a) The masking occurring at various levels in the auditory chain makes the masked speech\neffectively lost for subsequent processing and thus missing. Forward and backward masking in the time–frequency (T–F) plane, and masking in the frequency bands surrounded\nby more energetic neighbouring bands is routinely used in speech coding and compression\n(ex: ISO/IEC 11172-3 (1993); ISO/IEC 13818-3 (1995)). Another example is the “capture\neffect” exhibited in the neural code. The most intense component dominates the neural\nresponse both in terms of the firing rate and the temporal response pattern (Moore, 1982).\nLateral suppression and inhibition (discharge rate reduction in the presence of additional\nsignal) at the level of a single fibre in the inner ear is also documented. (Greenberg, 1997).\n(b) In natural auditory scenes, the number of sources is almost never one, and most of the time it\nis probably at least three. In addition, the role the speaker’s attention plays in attending one\nsource while pushing the rest in the “acoustic background”, may make missing data/masking\nmuch more ubiquitous in real life than in controlled artificial environments with a single\nacoustic source.\n32\n\n\fCHAPTER 3. MISSING DATA IN SPEECH PROCESSING\n\n33\n\n(c) Communication via restricted bandwidth channels occurs on a daily basis between human\nlisteners. Telephone speech is one example. Interfering band–limited noises are frequent in\nthe natural acoustic environment. Yet humans don’t have any problems when large parts of\nthe spectrum are missing.\n(d) Humans handle severe alterations of the signal in the time–frequency domain gracefully.\nLow and high pass filtered speech (Allen, 1994) and speech filtered through narrow and\nsteep bandpass filters (Warren et al., 1995; Steeneken, 1992) retains very high intelligibility\nsuggesting that:\n• speech is redundant and can be intelligible even if only small parts of the spectrum are\navailable\n• human audition can adapt to partial, scattered and sparse evidence in the time–\nfrequency plane\n(e) There is enough evidence by now suggesting that the human auditory system organises the\nconcurrent signals into perceptual streams (Bregman, 1990), regardless if it is confronted\nwith complex signals like speech or much simpler signals. The organisation seems to be\ninfluenced both by bottom–up primitive rules and top–down schemas. The computational\nmodels of this problem of “binding” the multiple sensory information to a particular source\nin the auditory scene typically assign each observation to a single source only. All the\ncriteria for organisation can rely only on the prior knowledge that physically distinct sources\nare independent. A typical organisation then looks for a subset of sufficiently (statistically)\ndependent signals which are sufficiently (statistically) independent from the other signals.\n(f) From purely signal processing point of view: the human hearing periphery exhibits a strong\ncompression transfer function, often loosely mimicked by log or cubic root compression\nfollowing the spectral analysis in the todays ASR systems feature extraction module. The\ncompression makes the approximation of a sum by a max operator much more viable. The\ndownside of the compression non–linearity is that the signal must have large enough dynamic\nrange so that the information transfer remains possible. The speech signal has a dynamic\nrange of more then 12 orders of magnitude. In addition to this, speech (and other sources)\ntoo exhibit quite sparse representation in the time–frequency plane.\nThe bottom two panels of Figure 3.1 show a T–F representation (after the compression) of both\nthe clean speech and noisy speech at global SNR of 0dB. Both are “seen through” the mask which\nselects the points where the speech is more energetic then the noise. The clean and the noisy\nspeech seem indistinguishable when seen through the mask.\n\n3.3\n\nThe missing data approach to robust speech recognition\n\nThe missing data approach to the problem of robust ASR assumes the following:\n• local patches in any time–frequency representation of the speech spectrum remain mostly\nunaffected by the other sounds even at very poor global SNRs;\n• they can be identified with a certain probability;\n• there is sufficient quantity of (partial) information in the patches for recognition of the speech\nthey originated from.\nIf these assumptions hold, and it is possible to engineer techniques that would produce results\n(under these assumptions), one would expect the recogniser to show graceful performance degradation in the cases of occlusion occurring when more then one source is present in the auditory\nscene. In that case, the two subproblems involving the application of missing data techniques to\nrobust ASR are:\n\n\fCHAPTER 3.

MISSING DATA IN SPEECH PROCESSING\n\n35\n\n• identification of the reliable parts of the spectrum\n• recognition using only the reliable parts of the spectrum\n\n3.3.1\n\nIdentification of the reliable parts of the speech spectrum\n\nThe identification of the reliable parts of the speech spectrum needs to use only the properties of\nthe speech signal and the physics of sound. We are going to assume some form of time–frequency\nrepresentation of the speech features from now on. But any representation preserving the local\nproperties of the sources would suffice. It has already been noted by several researchers that\nfeatures that preserve the localness of the time–frequency plane tend to be more amenable to\nnoise compensation in unmatched conditions (Holmes and Sedgwick, 1986; Barker, 1998; de Veth\net al., 1999). The separation process may be carried out:\n• using only bottom–up constraints, like CASA (Section 4.2) does by using “low–level” features\nemerging from the physics of sound; no specific source models are required, but rather a\nmore general knowledge about what features are bound together because they are likely to\nbe coming from the same source\n• using only top–down constraints in the form of whole source models (e.g. noise model),\nmaybe additionally paired with some prior knowledge about the nature of the “match” between the models and observations (acoustic back–off and the UNION model, Section 3.5.3)\nHowever, this is an artificial division. Both parts of the process contribute valuable constraints\nto the search for the best explanation of the attended source in multi–source environment. There\nis no reason not to use a constraint if one is available. Equally, there is no reason to rely on all\nconstraints being available to do the search.\nIn the following text, it will be assumed that the above processes will divide the feature vector\nx into a reliable (present) and unreliable (missing) component x = (xp , xm ). The distinction is\nfrom the viewpoint of the attended source. If there are two sources, then the present/missing\ndivision for the second source is going to be complementary/opposite to the first one. The process\ncan be visualised as if a “mask” xm has been placed over the feature vector x allowing us to see\nonly the present components xp . The mask m determines the separation completely.\nFigure 3.1 shows an example of what a mask might look like. The mask is derived for a\nmixture of the clean speech (a) (digits string utterance from TIdigits database (Leonard, 1984))\nwith noise (factory noise from NOISEX database (Varga et al., 1992)) at global SNR of 0dB (b).\nThe representation is a standard Mel–spectrum filterbank (Young and Woodland, 1993). Panel (c)\ndepicts the mask. The light blue dots indicate reliable regions1 . Panels (d) and (e) show the clean\nand the noisy speech respectively as “seen through” the mask. They are almost indistinguishable.\nIt would be advantageous if the separation process delivers assessment of how probable is the\nproposed mask. It would be even better if it is possible to assess the probability of every possible\nmask. That means that there will be a probability P (m) associated with each mask m. Choosing\na single mask (with a probability of unity) is one extreme case of this. The other extreme is failing\nto introduce any new constraints in the search and giving equal probability to every possible mask.\n\n3.3.2\n\nRecognition using the reliable parts of the spectrum only\n\nThe speech models need to have their probability evaluated with only parts of the observation\nvector coming from the source they are modelling. Since there is no prior knowledge which features\nare going to be missing, it is reasonable to assume that the models inferred during the training\nwill have complete feature vectors, and will be adapted to handle the occlusion occurring during\nthe recognition gracefully and in a principled manner. This requires adaptation of the models on\na frame–by–frame basis. The techniques for implementing the adaptation are:\n1 the criterion used for selection was 7.6555 dB local SNR; it was calculated by comparing the clean and the\nnoisy speech and assuming additivity of the speech and the noise in the power spectral domain\n\n\fCHAPTER 3. MISSING DATA IN SPEECH PROCESSING\n\n36\n\n• Marginalisation – only the present data xp is used to compute the likelihood of a model W .\nThe relation between the probability of the “full” data x and the partial present data xp for\na model W is:\nZ\np(xp |W ) =\np(xp , xm |W )dxm\n(3.1)\nΩxm\n\nThe marginal probability p(xp |W ), instead of the “full” probability p(x|W ) is then used in\nthe subsequent stages of processing.\n• Data imputation – the missing data is “filled in” (imputed) using the available knowledge in\nthe form of the model p(x|W ) and the present data xp . In order to do that, the conditional\ndistribution of the missing data xm is needed first:\np(xm |xp , W ) =\n\np(xp , xm |W )\np(xp , xm |W )\n=R\np(xp |W )\np(xp , xm |W )dxm\nΩx\n\n(3.2)\n\nm\n\nThen, a single value x̂m from the conditional distribution has to be chosen according to some\ncriterion and used as a “plug in” replacement for the missing values xm . The choice can be\nmade by minimising an error criterion. One of the most commonly used error measures is\nthe mean square error (MSE). In that case, the minimal MSE (MMSE) value for xm is the\nconditional expectation:2\nZ\nx̂m|W = E{xm |xp , W} =\nxm p(xm |xp , W)dxm\n(3.3)\nΩxm\n\nDepending on the circumstances of application of the technique, other criteria may be used\nas well (Chapter 5). Once x̂m is computed, it is used as a plug–in value instead of xm and\nthe “filled in” feature vector (xm , x̂m ) is used for further processing.\nThe techniques for handling missing data stem from the statistical techniques for manipulating\nprobability densities: marginalisation and conditioning. There is an intuitive connection between\nthem. The marginal distribution p(xp |W ) can be seen as an “average” over all possible conditional\nimputations p(xp |xm , W ) weighted by their respective probabilities of occurrence p(xm |W ):\nZ\np(xp |W ) =\np(xp |xm , W )p(xm |W )dxm\n(3.4)\nΩxm\n\n3.4\n\nReview of pattern matching methods for missing data\n\nNormally for the purposes of speech recognition it will be assumed that the full (clean) data is\navailable during the models training (parameter estimation). However, techniques for learning or\nmodel parameters estimation from incomplete data give insight into the possibilities for handling\nthe missing data condition in principled way.\nLittle and Rubin (1997) formalised the missing data mechanism as two coupled statistical\nprocesses, one generating a feature vectors X and another one generating masks M that determine\nwhich parts of X are present/missing. Their the joint distribution is:\np(X, M |θ, φ) = p(M |X, φ)p(X|θ)\n\n(3.5)\n\nwhere θ are the parameters of the production process and φ are the parameters of the censoring\nprocess. Then, the following observations about the nature of the missing data mechanism can be\nmade (Gelman et al., 1995; Ghahramani and Jordan, 1994b):\nR\np(x) the expectation\nE{x} = xp(x)dx is a value that minimises the\nR\n2\n2\nmean square error MSE; ex: M SE = E{(x − m) } = (x − m)\nR p(x)dx where m is the unknown value; setting the\nfirst derivative of the MSE with respect to m to 0 gives m = xp(x)dx i.e. m = E{x}\n2 for any random variable x with p.d.f.\n\n\fCHAPTER 3. MISSING DATA IN SPEECH PROCESSING\n\n37\n\n(a) The mask M is independent of the data X. The missing data is said to be missing completely\nat random (MCAR): p(M |X, φ) = p(M |φ)\n(b) The mask M depends on the present data Xp but not on the missing data Xm . The missing\ndata is said to be missing at random (MAR): p(M |X, φ) = p(M |Xp , Xm , φ) = p(M |Xp , φ)\n(c) The mask M depends both on the present data Xp and on the missing data Xm . The missing\ndata is said not to be missing at random (NMAR): p(M |X, φ) = p(M |Xp , Xm , φ). This is\nsometimes referred to as a data “censoring”.\nIn the case of robust ASR, Xp is the speech, and Xm is the noise observations. CASA (and\nother bottom–up techniques for speech estimation from noisy speech) assume that the mask M\ncan be determined using the speech observations Xp only, and independent of the noise Xm .\nTherefore they assume the MAR model (case (b)) of censoring. Techniques that rely on both the\n(estimated) speech and noise in order to derive the mask (e.g. noise estimation for the purposes of\nSNR estimation for mask estimation) need both Xp and Xm to derive M . Therefore they assume\nthe NMAR model (case (c)) of censoring.\nThe learning process is a search for parameters θ and φ that maximise the probability of the\nobserved (present) data Xp and the mask M . The maximum likelihood (ML) methods maximise\nthe likelihood:\nL(θ, φ|Xp , M ) ∝ P (Xp , M |θ, φ)\n(3.6)\nThe maximum a posteriori (MAP) based methods maximise the a posteriori probability:\nP (θ, φ|Xp , M ) ∝ P (Xp , M |θ, φ)P (θ, φ)\n\n(3.7)\n\nIn both cases, the common factor:\nZ\nP (Xp , M |θ, φ) =\n\nP (M |Xp , Xm , φ)P (Xp , Xm |θ)dXm\n\n(3.8)\n\ncontains the expression P (M |Xp , Xm , φ). In the cases of MCAR and MAR this expression is\nindependent of Xm so at least it is P (M |Xp , Xm , φ) = P (M |Xp , φ) (in the MCAR case even\nP (M |Xp , Xm , φ) = P (M |φ)). So P (M |Xp , Xm , φ) can be moved out of the integral giving:\nP (Xp , M |θ, φ) = P (M |Xp , φ)P (Xp |θ)\n\n(3.9)\n\nThe last equation is important as it allows to ignore the missing data mechanism if all that is\nneeded is estimation of θ (the parameters that define the process generating the data). The θ that\nmaximises L(θ|Xp ) ∝ P (Xp |θ) will also maximise L(θ, φ|Xp , M ).\nThe MAP estimator has an additional factor P (θ, φ) that connects the parameters of the data\ngenerating and the data masking process. One way around this is to assume that it is factorisable\nP (θ, φ) = P (θ)P (φ). Then the data generating process parameters θ can be estimated without\nthe need to estimate the masking process parameters φ.\nBoth ML and MAP can not ignore the data masking process in the NMAR case. Its parameters\nφ have to be estimated as well.\n\n3.4.1\n\nParameters estimation with missing data for mixture models\n\nWe will consider mixture models in connection with the density based approach to learning (Ghahramani and Jordan, 1994a). Both are commonly used in the speech recognition statistical systems.\nThe mixture model assumes the data was generated independently from a mixture of densities:\nX\nP (x) =\nP (x|k, θk )P (k)\n(3.10)\nk\n\nwhere the components denoted by k have the parameters θk . The density based approach to\nlearning estimates the joint density of the present and the missing data (and all variables, in fact)\n\n\fCHAPTER 3. MISSING DATA IN SPEECH PROCESSING\n\n38\n\nas a first step3 . All other relations of interest between any of the variables are derived from the\njoint density via conditioning and marginalisation. For example, the regression is the expectation\nover the conditional density.\nThe Expectation–Maximisation (EM) algorithm is usually the algorithm of choice for maximising the probability for the complete data (Dempster et al., 1977). For a given set if samples\nX = {xi }, the log–likelihood L (since the logarithm is a monotonic function, θ that maximises it\nmaximises the likelihood, too) is:\nX\nX\nL(θ|X) =\nlog(\nP (xi |k, θk )P (k))\n(3.11)\ni\n\nk\n\nwhere L(θ|X) = log p(X|θ) is the log–likelihood of the model parameters θ given the data X =\n{xi }.\nThe original EM–algorithm itself introduces a “hidden” indicator variable Z = {zik } that is 1\nif and only if the vector xi is generated by the mixture component k, and 0 otherwise. Then the\n“complete” log–likelihood L becomes:\nXX\nLc (θ|X) =\nzik log(P (xi |zi , θ)P (zi , θ))\n(3.12)\ni\n\nk\n\nThe variable zik is itself missing data, since it can not be observed directly. The EM–algorithm\nstates that L(θ|X) can be maximised by iteratively alternating the following two steps:\nQ(θ|θ(n) ) = E{Lc (θ|X, Z)|X, θ(n) } (E-step)\nθ(n+1) = argmaxQ(θ|θ(n) ) (M-step)\n\n(3.13)\n\nθ\n\nwhere (n) and (n + 1) denote two subsequent steps in the iteration. The extension when part of\nthe data is missing is natural. The only difference is that the expectation in the E–step is taken\nwith respect to the present (not the complete) data, in addition to the indicator variables Z.\nQ(θ|θ(n) )\n(n+1)\nθk\n\n= E{Lc (θ|Xp , Xm , Z)|Xp , θ(n) }\n= argmaxQ(θ|θ\n\n(n)\n\n)\n\n(E-step)\n\n(M-step)\n\n(3.14)\n\nθ\n\nP\nMixtures of Gaussian distributions k wk N (x; µk , Σk ) are the model commonly used in speech\nrecognition. For this case, the function Q(θ|θ(n) ) (E–step) in Eq.

MISSING DATA IN SPEECH PROCESSING\n\n39\n\nwhere N is the number of data vectors X = {xi }i=1...N .\nIn the case of missing data, it is not only the indicator variables that are missing, but parts\nof the data xi as well. We will introduce the notation µp,k and µm,k to denote parts of the mean\nvector of Gaussian k belonging to the present and missing components, and Σpp,k , Σpm,k , Σmp,k\nand Σmm,k to denote parts of the covariance matrix of the Gaussian k with covariances between\nthe present–present, present–missing, missing–present and missing–missing features. Similarly xp,i\nand xm,i denotes the present and missing components respectively of a feature vector xi . The\nlog–likelihood in that case is:\nXX\nXX\nLc (θ|Xp , Xm , Z) =\nzik log(P (xi |zi , θ)) +\nzik log(P (zi , θ))\n(3.20)\ni\n\nk\n\ni\n\nk\n\nIgnoring the second term (since only P (xi |zi , θ) is of interest to us), and decomposing the Gaussians\nto their present and missing components yields (Ghahramani and Jordan, 1994a):\nLc (θ|Xp , Xm , Z) =\nXX\n1\n1\nd\nzik [ log(2π) + log |Σk − (xp,i − µp,j )T Σ−1\npp,j (xp,i − µp,j )\n2\n2\n2\ni\nk\n\n1\nT −1\n− (xp,i − µp,j )T Σ−1\npm,j (xm,i − µm,j ) − (xm,i − µm,j ) Σmm,j (xm,i − µm,j )\n2\n\n(3.21)\n\nWhen computing Q(θ|θ(n) ) the first terms yields E{zik |xp,i , θ(n) } which (similarly to Eq. (3.16))\ngives:\n(n)\n(n)\n(n)\nwk N (xp,i ; µp,k , Σpp,k )\n(3.22)\nP (k|xp,i )(n+1) = P\n(n)\n(n)\n(n)\nk0 wk0 N (xp,i ; µp,k0 , Σpp,k0 )\nThe second term of Eq. (3.21) yields E{zik xm,i |xp,i θ(n) } which can be computed as:\nE{zik xm,i |xp,i θ(n) }\n\n=\n\nP (k|xp,i )(n+1) E{xm,i |zik = 1, xp,i , θ(n) }\n\n=\n\nP (k|xp,i )(n+1) (µm,k + Σmp,k Σ−1\npp,k (xp,i − µp,k ))\n\n(3.23)\n\nSimilarly, the third term of Eq. (3.21) yields E{zik xm,i xTm,i |xp,i θ(n) } which can be computed as:\nT\nT\nE{zik xm,i xTm,i |xp,i θ(n) } = P (k|xp,i )(n+1) (Σmm,k − Σmp,k Σ−1\npp,k Σmp,k + x̂m,i,k x̂m,i,k )\n\n(3.24)\n\nwhere x̂m,i,k = µm,k + Σmp,k Σ−1\npp,k (xp,i − µp,k ) is the regression (expectation) of the missing given\nthe present data for k-th Gaussian (used in Eq. (3.23), too). Once these terms are computed, the\nupdate formulae for the parameters of the model can be found the same way as in the complete\ndata case.\nGhahramani and Jordan (1994a) also consider the case of EM for discrete variables with\nincomplete data.\n\n3.4.2\n\nClassification with missing data\n\nAlthough the classification is just a special case of function approximation with the data vector\nelements divided into “inputs” and “outputs” and where the outputs are discrete variables (in\nmost cases), it warrants special attention. There are hybrid speech recognition systems where as\npart of the process evaluation of the posterior probability of a class given the data is needed.\nClassification with mixture models\nMixture models can handle classification with missing data naturally. Once the joint density of\nthe data and the class labels P (x, C = j|θ) is known, every relation between them can be derived\nreadily. Most often the posterior probability P (C = j|x, θ) is sought. One example for the joint\n\n\fCHAPTER 3. MISSING DATA IN SPEECH PROCESSING\n\n40\n\ndata – class labels density P (x, C = j|θ) is a mixture of type (Ghahramani and Jordan, 1994a;\nTresp et al., 1994):\nX\nwjk πk N (x; µk , Σk )\n(3.25)\nP (x, C = j|θ) =\nk\n\nwith Gaussian and multinomial components. If part of the vector xi is missing, then the E–step\nof the EM algorithm is:\n(n) (n)\n\nP (k|xp,i , Ci = j)(n+1) = P\n\n(n)\n\n(n)\n\nwjk πk N (xp,i ; µp,k , Σpp,k )\n\n(n) (n)\n(n)\n(n)\nk0 wjk0 wk0 N (xp,i ; µp,k0 , Σpp,k0 )\n\n(3.26)\n\n(n)\n\nIf the class label Ci is unknown then wjk factors vanish from the denominator and the numerator\nand the E–step is the same\nPas for a Gaussian mixtures, Eq. (3.22). Then in the M–step the class\nlabel’s j–th component is k P (k|xp,i , Ci = j)(n+1) wjk . The rest of the M–step is the same as at\nthe Gaussian mixture model.\nSomewhere in between the mixture model Eq. (3.25) and the feedforward networks discussed\nin the next subsection are the two layer radial bases functions (RBF) networks with Gaussian\nkernels (Bishop, 1995), used by Tresp et al. (1994) to classify with missing data. Each output yi\nof the network is computed as:\nP\nk wkj πk N (x; µk , Σk )\nyj (x) = P\n(3.27)\nk πk N (x; µk , Σk )\nWith suitable (unsupervised) training the network kernels in the first layer will estimate the data\ndensity–the denominator in the equation above. Similarly, the second layer will estimate the joint\ndensity of the data and the classes. It is then possible to compute the class posterior probability\ngiven a data vector P (Cj |xp ) needed for a forward pass when parts of the feature vector are\nmissing (Ahmad and Tresp, 1993):\nRP\nk wkj πk N (x; µk , Σk )dxm\nRP\nP (Cj |xp ) =\nk πk N (x; µk , Σk )dxm\nP\nw\nk kj πk N (xp ; µp,k , Σpp,k )\nP\n= yj (xp )\n(3.28)\n=\nk πk N (xp ; µp,k , Σpp,k )\nRadial basis Boltzmann machines are another class of networks that share the property of input data density estimation as part of the training process. Consequently, this special type of\nBoltzmann machine can handle missing data in their inputs naturally and have been used for\nclassification with missing data (Kappen and Nijman, 1995).\nClassification with feedforward networks\nMany feedforward networks have 1–of–N coding of the targets and are trained to minimise a\nquadratic error function. Richard and Lippmann (1991) have shown that in that case each output\nof the network yi estimates the posterior probability P (Ci |x) that the vector x comes from class\nCi . We will consider the case when part of the input is missing only. It will be assumed that\nthe class labels are always present. When part of the input is missing, the posterior probability\nP (C|xp ) of the class C given the present data xp is (Ahmad and Tresp, 1993; Bishop, 1995):\nZ\nP (C|xp ) = P (C|x)p(xm |xp )dxm\n(3.29)\nIntuitively, the form states that the estimate of the posterior on the basis present data P (C|xp )\nis the average of the full data posterior P (C|x) over all possible completions of the missing values\nxm , weighted by the probability that xm could occur, given the present data xp . I.e. it is the\nexpected conditional posterior given the present data Exm |xp {P (C|x)}.\n\n\fCHAPTER 3. MISSING DATA IN SPEECH PROCESSING\n\n41\n\nThe j–th network output N Nj (x) estimates the class conditional density of the j–th class\nN Nj (x) ≈ P (Cj |x) only. So the data density p(x) remains unknown. One solution to the problem\nis to estimate the data density separately (Tresp et al., 1995). For example, the input distribution\ncan be approximated using Parzen windows (Duda and Hart, 1973):\nP (x) =\n\n1 X\nN (x; xi , σ)\nN i\n\n(3.30)\n\nwhere\nP {xi } for i = 1 . . . N is the training data and σ is fixed. It is also obvious that P (xp ) =\n1\ni N (xp ; xp,i , σ). Then, the missing data integral Eq. (3.29) becomes:\nN\nZ\n1\n1 X\nP (Cj |xp ) = 1 P\nN Nj (x)[\nN (x; xi , σ)]dxm ,\nN i\ni N (xp ; xp,i , σ)\nN\n(3.31)\nwhere x = (xp , xm ) is a test data vector that is to be classified and has the xm components\nmissing.\nAssuming that the network prediction is constant over the “width” of the Gaussians, the\nN Nj (x) comes out of the integral (as a constant) and the integral cancels out the missing data\ndimensions of N (x; xi , σ) reducing it to N (xp ; xp,i , σ):\nP\nN Nj (xp , xm,i )N (xp ; xp,i , σ)\nP\nP (Cj |xp ) ≈ i\n(3.32)\ni N (xp ; xp,i , σ)\nThe expression N Nj (xp , xm,i ) means that this is the output of the network obtained feeding the\npresent components of the observation data vector and missing components from the i–th training\npattern. Therefore, in order to evaluate the missing data integral for a single input, a sum over all\npatterns from the training set has to be computed. This is nearly impossible to apply to a hybrid\nspeech recognition system, since the number of training examples is very large. Instead, some form\nof clustering or semiparametric density estimation (e.g. Gaussians mixture) of the data density\nin the training set maybe employed. Then, instead of using the complete training set during the\nrecognition, centroids of the clusters (means of the mixtures) will be used in the sum in Eq. (3.32).\nRaj et al. (1998) and Dupont (1998) used this approach.\nIf minimal assumptions only are to be made about the data density p(x), then a closed form\nEq. (B.14) (Appendix B) can be used to estimate the outputs of a single layer network with\nsigmoid transfer function. However, the assumption that an observation o makes all xm in the\ninterval [0, om ] equally probable is clearly geared toward application in speech recognition with a\ncertain type of features x. As in our experiments no hybrid ASR system was used, this line of\nenquiry was not followed through.\nLearning from incomplete data\nThe network parameters θ can be estimated once the probability of the complete data is known:\nX\nX\nL=\nlog(P (Cj |xi , θ)) +\nlog(P (xi |φ))\n(3.33)\ni\n\ni\n\nwhere φ denotes the parameters of the data density. Taking into account Eq. (3.29), the gradient\nof the likelihood with respect to network parameters θ is (Tresp et al., 1994; Ghahramani and\nJordan, 1994b):\n∂L X\n1\n=\n∂θ\np(Ci |xp,i )\ni\nZ\n∂P (Ci |xp,i , xm )\nP (Ci |xp,i , xm , θ)p(xm |xp,i , φ)(ti − P (Ci |xp,i , xm ))\ndxm\n∂θ\n\n(3.34)\n\n\fCHAPTER 3. MISSING DATA IN SPEECH PROCESSING\n\n42\n\nwhere ti is the desired output of the network for the data vector xi (which belongs to class Ci ).\nThe integral has no close form solution and has to be approximated by a Monte Carlo simulation.\nThe missing data components are drawn from the (known) input data distribution and then the\nintegral is calculated.\nRecurrent networks\nBengio and Gingras (1996) used recurrent networks with feedback for classification with missing\ndata. In the “static version”, network’s unknown inputs are initialised with their unconditional\nmean, and their value is then updated by feedback links with delays, just as if these were hidden\nunits. The network enters an oscillatory regime, effectively searching for the output giving minimal\nerror (as measured by the error function) and imputing the “missing” hidden units in the process.\nOn a small dataset, a learning algorithm using error backpropagation tested favourably compared\nto mixture model learning.\n\n3.4.3\n\nMissing data imputation for regression\n\nThe problem of regression (conditional average) E{y|x} is one commonly encountered in statistical\nanalysis. When some of the input data x is missing, one way to proceed with the regression\nanalysis is to impute the missing values (Little, 1992). The simplest method is to impute the\nmissing components by their unconditional sample means,4 computed from the data where these\ncomponents are present. An improvement over this is to impute the missing values from a linear\nregression estimated between the missing and the present components in the complete data (the\nconditional mean). When x and y are highly correlated, then even better imputations may be\nobtained by using y in addition to the present components of the data to compute the regression.\nHowever, the estimate obtained is biased and corrections need to be applied. The standard\nformulae for computing the errors on the complete data will not take into account the errors of\nthe imputation. Multiple imputation (Rubin, 1987) is one solution to this problem. Instead of a\nsingle imputation, the data set is divided into subsets and multiple imputations are calculated.\nThey are all in turn imputed and the complete data analysis is carried out giving multiple sets of\nregression parameters. The final parameters are their average.\n\n3.5\n\nMissing data for speech recognition: A review\n\nThe missing data approach has already been utilised for ASR. Cooke, Green, Anderson, and Abberley (1994b) reported on early experiments with application in speech recognition. A method\nfor adapting a conventional Hidden Markov model (HMM) based ASR system5 was developed\nwhich allows adaptation of the recogniser to an arbitrary pattern of occlusion in the observations.\nThe method employed marginalisation of the missing features, and the state emission probability\nis calculated as p(xp |S). It was shown that the adaptation to the recogniser because of marginalisation is simple – it essentially boils down to parameter selection of the state p.d.f.s Gaussians\nin the known dimensions.6 The training of the recogniser was on clean speech. The experiments\nwere performed with HTK toolkit (Young and Woodland, 1993) on a TIMIT database (Garofolo\nand Pallet, 1989) with random occlusions (missing data) on proportions from 0 to 90%. Graceful\ndegradation of performance was reported. Only after 60% of features were deleted, significant\ndegradation did occur. The new method was compared to unconditional mean imputation and\nclearly performed much better. In the discussion, a CASA (Section 4.2) system was envisaged as a\npreprocessor for separation. It was also noted that adapted HMM models can act in the separation\n4 sometimes mere zeros are imputed, especially if the data is “preprocessed” to zero mean and unit variance\n5 Contemporary speech recognition systems fall into two broad categories: HMM based (Rabiner and Juang, 1993)\nand hybrid systems (Bourlard and Morgan, 1993). In the further discussion we will\nPassume an HMM system with\nemission probability p(x|S) modelled as a mixture of diagonal Gaussians p(x|S) = k P (k|S)p(xp |k, S)p(xm |k, S),\nunless stated otherwise.\n6 Chapter 5 discusses this in detail\n\n\fCHAPTER 3. MISSING DATA IN SPEECH PROCESSING\n\n43\n\nprocess like “schemas”. The motivation comes from the evidence to suggest that in ASA there\nis flow of information from the top to the bottom (in addition to bottom–up processing), in a\ncoupled and self–reinforcing manner (Bregman, 1990).\nThe idea of using missing data for recognition of speech was extended further by introducing\ntraining with randomly deleted (missing) data (Cooke et al., 1994c). A self–organising, topology\npreserving Kohonen network was used for the experiments with a modified learning algorithms\nwhich takes into account only the present components of the feature vector. The experiments\nused PLP and ratemap(Cooke, 1991) representation and occluded data both during training and\nrecognition on a subset of the TIMIT database. There is little degradation for up to 50% deletions,\nwith the ratemap representation outperforming PLP, especially at deletions of more then 50% of\nthe data. It was speculated that this is because of the correlations between the features in the\nratemap vector.7 It was also noted that a further constraint can be utilised: the (observed) total\nenergy of the mixture implies that none of the components has greater energy then this.\nThis idea was further developed in (Cooke et al., 1994a). The motivation comes from auditory\nexperiments showing that perception of a particular sound can “fill in” gaps in the evidence, provided that there isn’t evidence against. This is termed “auditory induction” (Warren et al., 1994)\nand experiments have shown that people are not aware of gaps in the sounds if there is sufficient\nenergy to allow the possibility of a particular sound (the “phoneme restoration” effect (Warren,\n1970)). As a Kohonen net was used for classification, the “auditory induction” was implemented\nby giving less weight to the hypothesis that expect more energy then the total energy of the mixture of sounds at a particular place. The improvement was notable at high percentages of data\ndeletions. Experiments on correlated deletions ware also carried out, as better approximation to\nCASA. The relative importance of spectral peaks over the spectral valleys was noted for robustness: an ASR system relying on information in spectral valleys will not be robust as they “fill”\nwith noise first (see Section 2.7.7). It was also found that even for clean speech using the peaks\nonly (instead of the full spectrum) improves recognition. It can be speculated that this may be\nfor two reasons:\n• lessening the sensitivity to F0 which is speaker dependent and hinders the ASR performance\n• peaks are less correlated which makes modelling the speech with diagonal covariance matrices\nin the Gaussians more realistic\nGreen et al. (1995) reported on incorporating the “auditory induction” idea in an HMM based\nASR system originally used in (Cooke et al., 1994b). The state emission probability was computed\nas:\nZ om\nX\nP (k|S)p(xp |k, S)\np(xm |k, S)dxm\n(3.35)\nk\n\n−∞\n\nFurther, instead of a random deletion pattern, single and triple digits mixed with babble noise,\nboth from the NOISEX database (Varga et al., 1992) were used. In order to assess the potential\nof the technique with realistic noise, but without available CASA system, the present features\nwere found by comparison of the noisy with the clean speech. We will refer to the masks derived\nthis way as an a–priori masks (panel (c) of Figure 3.1). The comparison gives the local SNR in a\nparticular time–frequency point, as opposed to the global SNR, which is an average computed over\nthe whole utterance. The local SNR was thresholded at values ranging from -10dB to 10dB and\ntime–frequency points with local SNR below the threshold were considered missing. Comparisons\nof the simulated ASR system with 0dB threshold with listeners performance on the same task\ngave curves parallel to each other. However, listeners perform with virtually no degradation until\n0dB global SNR, and fall off to the levels of chance only at global SNR of -15dB.\nSeveral missing data imputation schemes for adapting the HMM recogniser (in addition to\nEq. (3.35)) coupled with different deletion patterns were reported in (Cooke et al., 1996). The\nmissing data imputation x̂m was performed as:\n• unconditional mean imputation x̂m = µm\n7 the PLP features are much more independent in the feature vector\n\n\fCHAPTER 3. MISSING DATA IN SPEECH PROCESSING\n\n44\n\n• conditional mean imputation x̂m = µm + ΣTpm Σ−1\npp (xp − µp )\n• conditional mean imputation together with conditional variance to weigh the distribution\nspread\nThe experiments were carried out on a Resource management (RM) task (Price et al., 1988). It\nwas found that performance of the missing data techniques degrades with “large block” across\ntime and frequency deletions. This is also the case with deletions derived from the a–priori mask.\nInvestigation showed that there are frames where no information at all is available across the whole\nspectrum. The covariance weighting giving more weight to the states in the frames depending on\nthe amount of available data was also tested. The above techniques, as well as other issues like data\northogonalisation were discussed in more details in (Morris et al., 1998). Using context dependent\nmodels with tying, tests were carried out on the same RM task with feature vectors complemented\nwith first and second order differences. The spectral peaks were again found to be advantageous.\n\n3.5.1\n\nRelation to the MAX model of speech and noise combination\n\nIt has been already noted by several researchers that assigning the energy in the mixture to one\nof the sources only is a viable approximation and also significantly eases the computations (Nadas\net al., 1989; Varga and Moore, 1991; Kadirkamanathan, 1992; Rose et al., 1994). As seen on\nFigure 3.2, the more energetic speech features “peak” over the noise, while the less energetic ones\ngradually submerge under the noise as the global SNR increases.\nThe MAX environment model (Nadas et al., 1989) models the resulting noisy speech x as:\nx = max(s, n)\n\n(3.36)\n\nAssuming noise and speech independence, for the cumulative probability PX (x) of the mixture8\nwe have:\nPX (x)\n\n= P rob{X ≤ x} = P rob{S ≤ x, N ≤ x}\n= P rob{S ≤ x}P rob{N ≤ x} = PS (x)PN (x)\n\n(3.37)\n\nAfter taking the derivative with respect to x, the density of X is expressed as:\npX (x) = pS (x)PN (x) + PS (x)pN (x)\n\n(3.38)\n\nOnce this relation is known, and assuming certain parametric models for the speech and the\nnoise, the parameters of the models can be derived from the noisy data. The EM for mixtures\n(Section 3.4.1) was used in (Nadas et al., 1989; Rose et al., 1994) to compute the reestimation\nformulae for speech modelled with Gaussian mixture model and noise modelled with single Gaussian. The formulae essentially express the intuition that the information content of the signals\nbelow the noise is low and they should be given less weight when updates are calculated. HMM\ndecomposition (Varga and Moore, 1991) (Section 2.8.2) can be used to deal with multistate noise\nmodels.\nThe missing data approach effectively utilises a MAX environmental model. However, it is\nassumed that no prior noise model\nR x will be available. Then Eq. (3.38) degenerates to pS (x) when\nthe feature x is present, and 1/x 0 pS (u)du when it is missing. In the latter case, noise is assumed\nto be uniformly distributed between 0 and x.\n\n3.5.2\n\nRelation to noise masking\n\nHolmes and Sedgwick (1986) modelled the masking of speech by noise (Section 2.6.3) similarly. The\nnoise process has a fixed threshold value known in advance. Then, the masked features contribute\nPS (x) to the probability (x is the observed value), while the unmasked features contribute pS (x).\n8 in this section only the random variables will be marked by capital letters, their realisations with small letters;\nthe probability density function of variable Q evaluated at point q is pQ (q), and cumulative probability function is\nPQ (q)\n\n\fCHAPTER 3.

The horizontal axis is\nthe time. The vertical axis is the log–magnitude.\nTraining with noisy speech is possible, as well. The mask value for each channel B is the\nhighest noise value found in the training data for that channel. If the fraction of masked features\nfor a channel is F , and µ0 is the sample mean of the unmasked samples, then the mean µ and\nvariance σ 2 are:\nµ =\nσ\n\n=\n\nµ0 erf −1 (F ) − BQ(F )\nerf −1 (F ) − Q(F )\nB−µ\nerf −1 (F )\n\n(3.39)\n\nwhere Q(x) = N (erf −1 (x), 0, 1).\nSimilarly to noise masking, Brendborg and Lindberg (1997) investigated two approaches to\nrobustness in the context of a HMM system:\n• mean value masking – Gaussians that have means smaller then a threshold were considered\nsensitive to noise and prevented from scoring very low probability scores\n• dimensionality reduction – Gaussians with means smaller then a threshold were ignored\nThe second technique was reported to give better results. It is equivalent to putting a default\nmissing data mask to every Gaussian in the mixture. The first technique is motivated by similar\n\n\fCHAPTER 3. MISSING DATA IN SPEECH PROCESSING\n\n46\n\nconcerns as the techniques from the next Section: preventing extremely low scores for outliers in\nthe distribution caused by points dominated by noise (and therefore not drawn from the speech\ndistribution). For sonorant sounds, results similar to PMC without utilising explicit noise model\nwere reported.\n\n3.5.3\n\nMissing feature compensation based on the acoustic evidence\n\nIf a state p.d.f. scores very low for a particular observation, all paths passing through that state\nwill have their scores depressed to the extent that it is unlikely that any of them will win. This\nis because the overall probability of a model is product of the probabilities in each frame. An\nextremely low probability at some frame effectively discards the model, regardless of strength of\nthe previous or subsequent acoustic evidence. Several factors contribute to this:\n• the Gaussian p.d.f. used for state emission probability modelling have very “slim” tails–they\nquickly fall–off when moving away from their mean\n• in the noisy speech, the unreliable (missing) features are not generated by the speech source,\nbut by the noise source; so they may fall on the tail of the speech p.d.f.\n• the Gaussians in the mixture are usually diagonal, the features are independent and the final\nscore is a product of the individual features scores; a feature lying on the tails of several\nGaussians and scoring very low diminishes the discrimination between the states, regardless\nof the evidence from the other features\nTwo techniques have emerged to address this problem: acoustic back–off and the UNION model.\nAcoustic back–off\nde Veth, Cranen, and Boves (1998) devised an acoustic back–off scheme in order to control the\ndamage: the state distribution is bounded by how low it can score. There is a certain analogy\nwith multigram language models, where a certain probability mass is reserved for the tuples never\nseen in the training data.9 There is also a connection with the well known problem of “outliers” in\nstatistics: the problem occurring when the data sample from which the distributions are inferred is\nnot representative enough. Therefore, points that were very rare in the training sample will score\nvery low probabilities. Difference of many orders of magnitude between the “regular” points and\n“outliers’ in the data space may be a poor model of the real process. Reserving certain probability\nmass for low–frequency points (and thus establishing a lower bound for the probability of the\n“outlier”) is one common technique. So the “backed–off” state p.d.f. p‘(x|S) is:\np0 (x|S) = αp(x|S) + (1 − α)p0\n\n(3.40)\n\nExperimental results in (de Veth et al., 1998) indicate improved robustness when tested with\nartificially induced “disturbance” of the features.\nThe UNION model\nThe union model (Ming and Smith, 2000; Ming et al., 1999) originates from attempts to merge\nthe partial evidence in the context of multiband/multistream speech recognition system (Bourlard\net al., 1996; Tibrewala and Hermansky, 1998). As mentioned above, the acoustic scores in the\npresent systems are multiplied together loosing the discriminability between the models when there\nis an outlier. Assuming feature independence, in the UNION model the probability of observing\nx = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) is given by the recurrent relation:\nn−1\nP (x) = P (∨ni=1 xi ) = P (∨n−1\ni=1 xi ) + P (xn ) − P (∨i=1 xi )P (xn )\n\n(3.41)\n\n9 assigning probability zero to the unseen tuples would rule out any possibility of recognition, regardless how\ngood the acoustic evidence for recognition is\n\n\fCHAPTER 3. MISSING DATA IN SPEECH PROCESSING\n\n47\n\nwhere P (∨ni=1 xi ) = P (x1 ∨ x2 ∨ . . . ∨ xn ) or equivalently:\nP (x) = 1 −\n\nn\nY\n\n(1 − P (xi ))\n\n(3.42)\n\ni=1\n\nIf the feature x is a spectral frame (and the individual features are the frequency bands), then this\nis the “product of error rule”: the probability of error is product of the probabilities of error in\nall frequency bands (Allen, 1994). In this form, the aim of the method is straightforward: when\nxi is an outlier and scores extremely low acoustic score, 1 − P (xi ) ≈ 1 and it doesn’t disturb the\noverall acoustic score. While the back-off tries to limit the damage done by the low scores, the\nunion model uses the low scores to its advantage.\nIt was noted that grouping each band separately greatly damages the discriminability. So\ngroups of bands are combined with the ∧ operator between them (thus accumulating the discriminability), and with the ∨ operator between them. This is the segment–based UNION model.\nHowever, both back–off and the UNION model do not add any new constraints in the recognition search. They can not handle the case when some noise patch matches some speech model\nrelatively well and therefore can not be discounted by its acoustic score.\n\n3.5.4\n\nMissing data imputation\n\nMissing data may be reconstructed independently of the speech recogniser. Once reconstructed,\nthe complete data can be fed to the recogniser which need not change at all. This approach is\nvery attractive, and it has already been used (Section 2.6) for speech enhancement. The difference\nis that the same techniques that are largely used for recognition (like clustering and modelling\nthe data distributions as Gaussian mixtures) are now utilised for reconstruction of the missing\nfeatures.\n(Raj et al., 1998) clustered the input data, and the cluster with maximum score for the present\ndata was used for filling in the missing values. In the second technique, the correlations across\ntime between the missing features and the most highly correlated present features were used\nin the data imputation process. Dupont (1998) used the data imputation as a preprocessor to a\nhybrid HMM/ANN system. The separation was carried out via thresholding of the estimated SNR\n(assuming additive noise model). The data distribution was estimated separately with Gaussians\nmixture model (GMM). Then, the missing features were compensated by imputing the conditional\nmean.\nRenevey and Drygajlo (2000b,a) integrated together feature separation, spectral subtraction,\nPMC\ncompensation and data imputation. The data p.d.f. was estimated with diagonal GMM\nP\nP\n(k)N\n(x, µ, σ 2 ; k) independently of the recogniser. Under the additive noise assumption, an\nk\non–line noise estimation was carried out and the noise p.d.f. was computed. The distribution\nof the noise was assumed to be Gaussian. Then, the probability of each channel being noisy\ncan be computed for a given observation. By thresholding, the features are separated on present\n(probability that noise in that channel is greater then the threshold) or missing (probability that\nnoise in that channel is smaller then the threshold). The data GMM model was first compensated\nwith PMC (Eq. (2.23)) using the running noise model estimate. Next, the responsibilities of the\ncompensated GMM were calculated:\n2\nP (k)N (x; µpmc , σpmc\n; k)\n0\n2\n0\nk0 P (k )N (x; µpmc , σpmc ; k )\n\nP (kpmc |x) = P\n\n(3.43)\n\nThen in (Renevey and Drygajlo, 2000b) the missing features were compensated by imputing the\nexpected value of the compensated conditional distribution:\nX\nP (kpmc |xp )µm,k\n(3.44)\nx̂m = Exm |xp {xm } =\nk\n\nThe present features xp were compensated with spectral subtraction.\n\n\fCHAPTER 3. MISSING DATA IN SPEECH PROCESSING\n\n48\n\nIn (Renevey and Drygajlo, 2000a) instead of dividing the features on present and missing from\nthe onset and compensating them separately, the probability that a channel is noisy Ψ(x) was\nused as a “soft” measure between the conditional mean of the compensated GMM and the noisy\nobservation:\nX\nx̂m = [1 − Ψ(x)]Exm |xp {xm } + Ψ(x)x = [1 − Ψ(x)]\nP (kpmc |xp )µm,k + Ψ(x)x\n(3.45)\nk\n\nThe techniques showed an improvement over the baseline on the task of recognition digit strings\nfrom TIdigits database (Leonard, 1984) mixed with noise from NOISEX-92 database (Varga et al.,\n1992).\nPark and Kim (2000) reported on data imputation from a GMM model of the wideband speech\nfor narrowband (telephone) to wideband speech enhancement.\n\n3.5.5\n\nStochastic features\n\nSeveral researchers have noted that if a measure of the feature reliability is available, then it\nis desirable to integrate over the domain of the unreliable feature, weighting the integral with\nthe reliability measure. In the extreme, if the variance of the feature is infinite, the technique\ndegenerates into marginalisation.\nGarner and Holmes (1998) used this idea to incorporate formant features into a conventional\nHMM–based ASR system. Both the estimate of the reliability of the tracker and the formant\nfeatures were rigorously incorporated in the HMM model.\nSimilarly, the unreliability of the features after spectral subtraction was used to weight the\nevidence during the Viterbi search in an HMM system and during the dynamic programming (DP)\nsearch in a dynamic time warping (DTW) ASR system (Yoma et al., 1998). nad H. Pao et al.\n(1998) named those features “stochastic features”, and again used their variance as a weighting\nfactor along the integration path.\n\n3.5.6\n\nMissing data combined with other techniques\n\nThe missing data approach has been combined naturally with several other techniques for robust\nASR on a speaker verification task (El-Maliki, 2000). It was also used to deal in a principled way\nwith the “negative spectrum” problem arising in spectral subtraction. The features where the noise\nestimation failed can be considered missing and marginalised (Drygajlo and El-Maliki, 1998a).\nSimilarly, it naturally combines with PMC: only the missing features need to be compensated\nwith PMC (Renevey and Drygajlo, 1999). Compared to “plain” PMC, an improvement on the\nASR task of digit strings recognition in noise was reported at all SNRs and for all tested noises.\n(Drygajlo and El-Maliki, 1998b,c) used a missing data based system, together with non–linear\nand adaptive generalised SS and MMSE spectral amplitude estimator for detection of the missing\nfeatures (El-Maliki and Drygajlo, 1999) for robust speaker verification. Padmanabhan and Picheny\n(2000) utilised the idea of missing data within a multiscale graphical model designed to address\nseveral shortcomings of the current systems. Droppo et al. (2002) learnt a separate conditional\ndistribution p(noisy|clean) for different SNRs and noises (from noisy data) and then used the\nconditional average of the state likelihood (inferred from clean data) during the decoding.\n\n3.5.7\n\nMissing data in speech perception modelling\n\nA missing data recogniser was used to model the perception of severely spectrally reduced sine–\nwave speech (Barker and Cooke, 1997; Barker, 1998). The sine–wave speech represents the natural\nspeech by a small number time varying sinusoids (somewhat similar to formant synthesis). It is a\ncrude approximation of the natural speech, and yet it remains intelligible.10 Since it is a greatly\nreduced representation, sine–wave speech was posed as a challenge to the bottom–up grouping on\n10 with some training on the part of the listeners\n\n\fCHAPTER 3. MISSING DATA IN SPEECH PROCESSING\n\nFigure 3.3: Decrease in correctness of HSR\n(“HUMAN”), MD ASR (” MISSING FEATURE MFB”), filterbank (“MFB”) and cepstra (“CEPSTRA”) based ASR with highpass\nfiltered speech (reproduced from Lippmann and\nCarlson (1997))\n\n49\n\nFigure 3.4: Decrease in correctness of HSR\n(“HUMAN”), MD ASR (” MISSING FEATURE MFB”), filterbank (“MFB”) and cepstra (“CEPSTRA”) based ASR with lowpass\nfiltered speech (reproduced from Lippmann and\nCarlson (1997))\n\nthe basis of primitive features in the speech (Remez et al., 1994). (Barker, 1998) used a missing\ndata recogniser to recognise sine–wave speech successfully with models trained on clean speech.\nSpectral peaks were used as features for recognition. During the recognition, spectral peak xi,t\nwas identified in channel i at time frame t, according to:\n(\n1 if xi,t > xi,t−1 and xi,t > xi,t+1\npeak(i, t) =\n(3.46)\n0 otherwise\nThe features in the peak positions were used for recognition, while the rest of the features in\nthe vector were marginalised. A small improvement was also noted with models trained on the\npeaks from the clean speech with Viterbi training, despite the data sparseness (only a small\nfraction of the data are spectral peaks) compared to the “whole spectrum” models. Since the\nfeatures used (64–channel ratemap) have fine frequency resolution and resolve the harmonics of\nthe fundamental, selecting the spectral peaks effectively amounts to spectrum sampling at the\nmultiples of the fundamental frequency F0 – similarly to the double vowel identification model\nbelow.\nExperiments with low and high–pass filtering showed a gradual decrease in the performance\nfor missing data based recogniser similar to one observed with humans (Lippmann and Carlson,\n1997) (Figures (3.3) and (3.4)). Provided that:\n• the missing bands are known in advance, and the models are adapted correspondingly (in\nthis case a low and high frequency filter were used, with known cut–off frequencies),\n• there is no contextual information which humans can make use of, and machines can not (in\nthis case nonsense CVC syllables ware used),\nUnder these conditions, the curves of performance decrease for humans and missing data based\nrecogniser are parallel in shape. It should be taken into account that the human performance is for\nmuch harder task of nonsense syllables recognition, while machine recognition is for digits recognition task (perplexity of 6900 vs. 10). The recogniser used marginalisation without additional\nconstraints. The identity of the missing features was known a–priori.\nA joint psychophysical and modelling study assessing the intelligibility of band–pass filtered\nspeech for humans and a missing data recogniser (Cunningham and Cooke, 1999) indicated that:\n\n\fCHAPTER 3. MISSING DATA IN SPEECH PROCESSING\n\n50\n\n• The intelligibility of the speech filtered through gammatone bandpass filters with centre\nfrequencies in the 1-3kHz range remains high.\n• The performance increases further when noise (up to a certain level) is added to an appropriately selected bands. It was speculated that the added noise acts as a counter–evidence\nexplaining the spectral restoration effect.\n• a missing data recogniser employed on the same task (the mask was known in advance)\nshowed a pattern of performance similar to the humans, although at much lower level. The\nperformance rose as the number of channels increased. However, for the higher channels the\ngap remained much larger then for the lower channels, indicating a deficiency in the feature\nextraction at the higher channels. Using the auditory induction constrained didn’t improve\nthe results for the recogniser. A gap in the performance at 750Hz was notable both with\nhuman listeners and the missing data recogniser.\nde Cheveigne and Kawahara (1999) constructed a missing data based model of vowel identification. On a simple task of identification of five synthetic vowels,11 relying on the shape of short\nterm smoothed spectrum12 was found lacking. With increase of F0 , the effects due to truncation and aliasing could not be ignored, and adversely affected the distance measure between the\ntemplate Ti and the target example T . A missing data model where the short term spectrum\nwas sampled at multiples of estimated F̂0 and matched against the template at these points only,\nwas found to be resistant to increases in F0 . The new distance measure was implemented as a\nweighting function W (f ) to the squared spectral distance D(T, Ti ):\nW (f )\n\n=\n\n∞\nX\n\nδ(f − nF̂0 )\n\nn=0\n\nZ\n\nD(T, Ti )\n\n=\n\n[T (f ) − Ti (f )]2 W (f )df\n\n(3.47)\n\nA fundamental frequency tracker is needed for F0 estimation. It was discussed that if it can\nestimate the p.d.f. of the F0 13 instead of a single value, it would provide natural adaptation when\nF0 can not be estimated or is unlikely to be estimated well.\n\n3.6\n\nSummary\n\nIn this chapter the idea that parts of the speech spectrum may be obscured by sounds from other\nsources in a multisource acoustic environment and thus effectively removed from the recognition\nprocess was introduced. It is termed missing data, or missing features in speech. Arguments\nsupporting the idea, coming from observations of how humans handle natural auditory scenes,\nexperiments on humans with artificial stimuli, physiological evidence from various levels in the\nauditory chain and arguments from a signal processing perspective were put forward. On this\nbasis, the missing data approach to robust ASR was formulated. It envisages that the recognition\nshould be performed in two distinct steps:\n• identification and grouping of the evidence coming from the speech source of interest\n• adaptation of the recogniser, and recognition of the partial speech\nIt was speculated that the approach should be adaptable and robust to various speech degradations.\nNext, the techniques for pattern classification (training and recognition) were reviewed. They\ncan be systematised into two broad classes:\n11 well separable in the F 1 − F 2 plane\n12 derived by Fourier transform of the spectrum, truncation of the coefficients above 2F\n0\n\nand inverse Fourier\ntransform\n13 the Dirac δ function is one extreme case – the F estimation process could assume less constrained parametric\n0\nform for the p.d.f. and estimate its parameters, e.g. assuming a Gaussian p.d.f. and estimating the variance in\naddition to the mean\n\n\fCHAPTER 3. MISSING DATA IN SPEECH PROCESSING\n\n51\n\n• techniques relying on marginalisation of the missing data\n• techniques using the knowledge of the present data to impute estimates of the missing data\nSome pattern classifiers (typically those estimating the data p.d.f. as part of the learning process)\nare more amenable to adaptation for handling missing data then the others (typically estimating\nthe conditional densities only, not the joint density between the data and the classes).\nIn the last section previous missing data studies in connection with speech and speaker recognition and speech perception were reviewed. Relations to other models for achieving robustness\nwere also highlighted, and the ways of combining the missing data approach with other techniques\nfor robust ASR was discussed.\n\n\fChapter 4\n\nMissing data identification\n4.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe first task in the proposed missing data based robust ASR system is to identify (with a certain\ndegree of confidence) the reliable regions of features on which the recognition is going to be based.\nThe way humans do this seems to be by auditory scene analysis (ASA) (Bregman, 1990),\nutilising principles (prior knowledge) reaching back to the physics of sound. Computational ASA\n(CASA) (Brown and Cooke, 1994) tries to devise models for separation of the speech from the\nmixture of sounds in a similar manner to ASA. The techniques will be discussed in the next section.\nSound sources are physically independent entities and therefore the corresponding signals in\nthe mixture will be independent by default.1 With loose assumptions about the nature of the\nmixing process, this knowledge can be used to devise a transformation that will increase (some\nmeasurement of) the independence between the sounds in the transformed mixture, compared to\nthe original mixture of sounds. This class of techniques will be considered in Section 4.3.\nThe identification of the reliable parts of the spectrum can be also achieved by measuring\nthe local SNR in each time–frequency point. Since neither the clean speech nor the noise are\navailable, a model for their combination has to be assumed. Then, either the clean speech or the\nnoise estimate are derived from the noisy speech. The methods for achieving this are discussed in\nSection 4.4.\n\n4.2\n\nAuditory scene analysis\n\nAuditory Scene Analysis (Bregman, 1990) refers to the ability of the auditory system to segregate/decompose mixtures of sounds that enter the ears into their corresponding constituents\noriginating from the same source. It is a theory of hearing. It lays down the principles governing\nthe process of putting together the signals coming from the same physical source into a coherent\nperceptual stream. This process in audition seems less obvious then a similar one in vision, where\nit is immediately clear that many objects will enter the field of vision. So, most of the potential\napplications in audition (e.g. ASR) assume quiet, single source environment where the problem of\nforming perceptual streams that correspond to the auditory “objects” (sound sources) is “solved”\napriori, as all signals originate from that source.\nToday there seems to be a consensus between the researchers that (Cooke and Ellis, 1999):\n• The processes of perceptual organisation operate on some kind of time–frequency representation. Typically these representations are the firing rates of the auditory nerve.\n• There are bottom–up (BU) rules giving rise to cues about which parts of the speech in the\ntime–frequency plane might originate from the same physical source. This is called primitive\ngrouping.\n1 they may not be in music, for instance\n\n52\n\n\fCHAPTER 4. MISSING DATA IDENTIFICATION\n\n53\n\nFigure 4.1: Illustration of the law of proximity: the closer lines tend to form pairs; we tend to see\nvertical stripes of dots since the horizontal distance between the dots is bigger then the vertical\n(after Katz (1951, pp. 24))\n• There is stored knowledge about the familiar sound patterns, e.g. speech. The representations of the familiar patterns are called schemas and the mechanisms schema–driven. The\nschemas need not be complete speech units, nor even speech. “High–level” speech schemas\n(if existed) would be similar to the speech models in the ASR. The problem of segregation\nof sources can be solved (to a certain extent) even using schemas alone. Again, if schemas\nwere complete speech units, the HMM decomposition (Section 2.8.2) technique would be an\nexample of completely schema driven separation.\nThe bottom–up rules are of special interest for robust ASR. They can be considered to be\nsource independent apriori constraints about how likely is that a group of features comes from the\nsame source. They facilitate the process of streaming, in which disparate signals reaching our ears\nare grouped together as coming from separate sound objects/sources. The BU constraints are not\nutilised in present ASR systems. Both in audition and in vision these rules draw on a school of\nthought termed Gestalt psychology and developed in the beginning of the 20-th century (Koffka,\n1935; Ellis, 1955; Kohler, 1947). Gestalt psychologists explored the principles that humans use to\ngroup sensory evidence together to form coherent objects in general (but with interest primarily\nin vision). The rules they derived are applicable to audition, too (Katz, 1951):\n• the law of proximity: with all other things equal, the elements closest to each other tend to\nform groups. Figure 4.1 is an example of visual proximity. The acoustic components tend\nto be group together according to their proximity on the time–frequency plane, too.\n• the law of similarity: when more then one element type is present, similar elements tend to\nform groups. Figure 4.2 illustrates this law in vision. In audition, sounds with similar pitch,\ntimbre, intensity or spatial location tend to form groups.\n• the law of closed forms: with all other things equal, the lines enclosing a surface tend to\ngroup together. Figure 4.3 is an example of the law applied in vision. The formulation of the\nlaw is clearly motivated by vision (e.g. “lines”, “surface”). In audition, its meaning would\nbe that the grouping tends to support whole (complete) perceptual forms. The phoneme\nrestoration effect (Warren, 1970) is one such example. Listeners are unaware of absence\n\nFigure 4.2: Illustration of the law of similarity: similar objects (the thick vs. thin lines, the full\nvs. the empty circles) tend to form groups (after Katz (1951, pp. 25))\n\n\fCHAPTER 4. MISSING DATA IDENTIFICATION\n\n(a)\n\n54\n\n(b)\n\nFigure 4.3: Illustration of the law of closed forms: lines enclosing a surface in (b) tend to form a\ngroup while they group exactly the opposite way in (a) (after Katz (1951, pp. 26))\nof short segments of speech when they are replaced by louder noise. Similarly, when parts\nof speech are obscured by noise bursts, the listeners report hearing the whole sentence\nand noise bursts, not a sentence interrupted by noise bursts. The sentence is perceived as\ncomplete. The auditory system seems to selectively pick the evidence to support a whole\nsentence hypothesis, as if searching for a simpler, rather than more complicated explanation.\nAnother example is hearing the pitch of a complex sound to be at a frequency containing\nno energy at all. Taking the resolved higher harmonics into account, the auditory system\njudges that the evidence outweighs the lack of energy at the frequency of the fundamental.\n• the law of “good” contour, or common fate: parts that have a “good” contour, or common\nfaith, tend to group together. Figure 4.4 is a visual example. In audition, sounds tend\nto change slowly. Speech is smoothly changing signal, because it is produced by a physical system of slowly moving articulators. The auditory system expects continuous sound\ncontours–sharp discontinuity in frequency, intensity or spatial location may signal a new\nsound source entering the auditory scene.\n• the law of common movement: elements get grouped together when they move in the same\ntime and/or similar manner. In hearing, common start/stop time (onset/offset) of the harmonics, common change in their amplitude (amplitude modulation–AM), or change in their\nfrequency at the same time (frequency modulation–FM) tend to indicate that components\nbelong to the same source.\n• the law of experience: the comprehension of symbolic forms depends on the circumstances\nunder which they were learnt. This law looks slightly at odds with the previous five. It can\nbe considered as an acknowledgement by the Gestalt psychologists that not only bottom–\nup process shape our perception (which is what the previous laws are about). Top–down\nprocesses (dependent on the “schemas” or models acquired through experience) also play a\npart in it.\nIt should be noted that in the real world the grouping principles compete mutually. Since real\nworld objects are much more complex then mere lines and dots (used here to illustrate the laws),\n\nFigure 4.4: Illustration of the law of good contour or common faith: we see a circle and a trapezoid\nbecause parts of each have a common destiny (after Katz (1951, pp. 26))\n\n\fCHAPTER 4. MISSING DATA IDENTIFICATION\n\n55\n\nall or most of the principles have a say in the process of binding the sensory input to the perceptual\nstreams. Similarly, in audition, pure tones are rarely heard in the real world. The natural sound\nreaching our ears every moment can be considered as a cacophony of pure tones. Further, the cues\nwork in concert to either mutually support a particular grouping or contradict each other. There\nis also the issue of quantification – how much does a cue support particular grouping. There must\nbe a mechanism to resolve the contradictions and come up with a single solution to the binding\nproblem. It is interesting that the Gestalt psychologists have observed that the solution may\nchange (and even oscillate) over time, especially when several competing groupings seem equally\npossible (Kohler, 1947, pp. 171).\nJust as “visual illusions” offer an insight into the mechanisms of visual perception, researchers\nin audition have designed experiments which reveal aspects of auditory processing. In a recent\nASA review Cooke and Ellis (1999) identified the following following cues as likely to be significant:\n• synchronous transitions across frequency regions – common onset or offset\n• correlated envelopes in different frequency channels, i.e. correlated frequency modulation\n• unresolved harmonics – channel envelopes with periodicity at F0\n• resolved harmonics – peaks in the spectrum at frequencies which are multiples of F0\n• interaural time difference arising from the different path lengths of the sound to the ears\n• interaural level difference due to head shadowing\n• across–time similarity of whole–event attributes such as pitch, timbre\n• long interval periodicity giving rise to the perception of rhythm\nIf we envisage a system where the various grouping cues reinforce or contradict each possible\ngrouping, something similar to a generalised Viterbi search in ASR may finally resolve the conflict\nand come up with the most likely solution to the binding problem (Barker et al., 2000). In speech\nthe bottom–up processes are intermingled with the top–down schema driven processes making it\nharder at assess their respective contributions to the binding.\n\n4.2.1\n\nComputational Auditory Scene Analysis\n\nComputational auditory scene analysis (CASA) (Brown and Cooke, 1994)2 is a new discipline\ninvolved in building computational models with techniques based on conclusions of the perceptual\nstudies of ASA (as performed by humans). In the past most of modelling effort in the speech\ncommunity was on tackling the problem of ASR alone. The CASA models are much more general\nand aim to model the hearing process in general. They are of varying complexity and are built\nwith various aims: from low–level simulations of neurophysiological processes, through mid–level\nsimulations of some of the simpler tasks facing listeners (like double vowel segregation), to systems\nattempting to separate mixtures of whole sentences (thus incorporating the notion of time in the\nsystem) and/or real–world noises and acting as front–ends to ASR systems.\nAll systems roughly consist of two major parts. The first part performs some kind of time–\nfrequency analysis analogous to the one performed by the ear as an initial step. It is usually\nthrough a filterbank with impulse response roughly matching the one of the human ear. In some\nsystems the neural response of the auditory nerve to the stimulus is modelled, too. Next, some\nof the cues considered important for grouping (onset/offset, harmonicity, etc.) are computed and\nrepresented in some form. The second major part of the system differs, and the systems fall into\ntwo major groups (Cooke and Ellis, 1999):\n• Weintraub (1985); Cooke (1991); Brown (1992); Wang and Brown (1999) group the information in a bottom–up fashion in the next phase. The elements are grouped together if there\nis evidence for that.\n2 see Rosenthal and Okuno (1998) and references therein for a recent cross–section of the field\n\n\fCHAPTER 4. MISSING DATA IDENTIFICATION\n\n56\n\n• Cooke et al. (1993); Ellis (1996); Nakatani et al. (1998); Godsmark and Brown (1999) continue by generating hypothesis about the possible groupings and matching them with the\nacoustic evidence. Sometimes the systems are termed as “blackboard architectures” or explanation based systems.\nBottom–up systems\nWeintraub (1985) attempted separation of two simultaneous speakers using the estimated pitch\nperiod of the voices. A hand crafted seven state Markov model, with states corresponding to\nsilence, periodic, non–periodic, onset, offset, increasing and decreasing periodicity, estimated the\npower spectrum. A dual pitch tracking algorithm was used to devise and assign the signal energy\nto the spectrums of the both voices.\nCooke (1991) computed time–frequency tracks called “synchrony strands” from the output\nof the auditory periphery model. Their formation was guided by local similarity and continuity\nconstraints. They encompassed the dominant periodic components. The grouping algorithm used\nthe harmonicity cue for the lower frequency channels and amplitude modulation for the higher\nfrequency channels.\nBrown (1992) used similar decomposition into synchronous partials. In addition, the pitch of\neach partial was computed by combining a summary autocorrelation across the channels with the\nlocal autocorrelation, giving rise to a pitch contour for each partial. The systems then searched\nfor groups with common pitch contours. Among them, the ones with common onsets were given\npreference in grouping. Figure 4.5 depicts an example of grouping, segregation and the resulting\nrepresentation of the speech speech (the interfering noise is a siren).\nThe oscillatory correlation model of Wang and Brown (1999) departs from the symbolic representations used in the previous (and the next) models. The low – level representation is nerve\nfiring probability model, while the mid – level representation involves pooled (across channels)\ncorrelation for pitch detection, and cross-correlation between the adjacent channels. However, the\nsearch stage, where the grouping occurs, is replaced with a two layer network of oscillators. The\nfirst layer consists of relaxation oscillators excited locally and inhibited globally. The oscillators\nin the second layer are linked by lateral connections. Together, both layers implement the cues\nof proximity (elements close in time and frequency are grouped together) and good continuation.\nThe first layer produces smaller structures, while the second layer groups these structures into\nstreams. The neurophysiological findings give this architecture a neurobiological foundation. The\nmodel is also consistent with the parallel and distributed processing paradigm.\nTop–down systems\nCooke et al. (1993) and Godsmark and Brown (1999) used a “blackboard” architecture for their\nCASA systems. The blackboard system has a global data structure (the “blackboard”), accessible\nby the modules that implement various rules (the “experts”). If some expert concludes that the\ncurrent data on the blackboard gives it a reason to act, it does so under a control of the blackboards’\nmonitor module (the “scheduler”). The scheduler orders the experts’ actions in time. The result\nof an action is change in the blackboards’ configuration. The experts in the systems implemented\ngrouping by common F0 , common amplitude modulation and common onset/offset time.\nEllis (1996) utilised a “prediction – driven” architecture in his system. It segregates the\nsounds by “explaining” the predictions generated by the internal “audio world model” with the\nacoustic evidence. This is essentially a search for the most probable hypothesis in the space of\npossible hypothesis–explanations of the observed evidence. The search is mostly heuristic. The\nmid – level sound elements are: noise clouds of unstructured noise energy; tonal elements with\nperceived periodicity – wefts; and transients i.e. rapid bursts without pitch or any other structure.\nThe system works in terms of prediction and reconciliation: depending on the current evidence,\npredictions are made about the speech in the future time instant. The predictions are probabilistic\nin the the sense that the mean/expected value is generated together with a margin of uncertainty\n(the expected error).

If there is a surplus of energy, additional elements are hypothesised to account\nfor the energy. If the observed signal lacks energy, then some of the elements will be terminated\nin a consistent manner.\nThis is not dissimilar to the system by Nakatani et al. (1998). Here, another paradigm for\nthe blackboard architecture is formulated: the data is explained through a “cooperation” of independent “agents”, specialists for particular task. There are modules (“agencies”) for creation\nand destruction of agents depending of whether there is surplus or lack of energy compared to\nthe prediction. The architecture is termed “residual driven”. The system is binaural and uses\nbinaural harmonicity and localisation cues.\nPerformance\nDespite the progress made toward a CASA system that will approach human performance, it is\nwidely recognised (the authors of the systems included) that the present systems have a huge gap\nto bridge. Even the “second generation” of “top–down” systems which take into consideration\ncertain high level constraints do not approach human audition. Still, in all cases a worthwhile\nimprovement in SNR was noted. Lately, it has been argued (Roweis, 2000) that a statistical\napproach may be better suited to the problem of reconciling the different and sometime conflicting\ngrouping cues.\n\n4.2.2\n\nIntegration of CASA and ASR\n\nEnhancement\nThe integration of CASA and ASR happened quite early – one of the very first systems by Weintraub (1985) assessed the quality of the separation by running the separated speech through an\nASR system and noting the resulting accuracy. The same path has been taken by the most subsequent systems: the CASA system separates the speech from the “background” first, the speech is\nresynthesised from the fragments assigned to it, and the ASR system tries to recognise this speech\nnext. It is not hard to see why this approach of integration is so popular:\n• the task is clearly separated into two independent stages, making the construction of the\nsystems easier\n• systems that were not designed with integration in mind, can by simply integrated this way\n• once CASA is considered as a “speech enhancement” process and the result of the analysis is\nspeech, a number of criteria (objective and subjective) can be employed to assess the quality\nof enhancement (SNR, intelligibility, accuracy, etc.)\nTypically, the approach yields an improvement compared to the recognition of the noisy speech (Okuno\net al., 1999), but it has not been proven that it performs significantly better then other techniques\nfor robust ASR (e.g. noise estimation, blind source separation).\nThe problems of the “enhancement path”\nThe “enhancement” combination of CASA and ASR has serious shortcomings. It is quite certain\nthat speech schemas play a role in speech perception. There are experimental examples of schemas\ndefeating the bottom–up grouping rules, as in the “duplex phenomena” where parts of the stimulus\nare interpreted as belonging to more then one speech source. The ASR system contains a detailed\nlibrary of high level schemas – the speech models. When the CASA system is used merely as a\npreprocessor prior to ASR, the models are not utilised during the separation process.\nFurther, separation via CASA and subsequent resynthesis introduces various distortions in\nthe speech signal that is input to the ASR system. The ASR systems operate best in matched\nconditions: when the speech they recognise is (statistically) the same as the material they were\n\n\fCHAPTER 4. MISSING DATA IDENTIFICATION\n\n59\n\nFigure 4.6: Visual occlusion (check Figure 4.7 for a hint – after Bregman (1990)).\ntrained with. The resynthesised speech may be very different from the clean speech, as the scope\nand the nature of the distortion introduced by CASA can not be easily assessed. This can be\nameliorated by training the ASR system on a noisy speech that has been processed with the\nCASA system.\nA notable problem with the “speech reconstruction” application of CASA to ASR is that CASA\nsystems typically assign the energy of a point in the spectrum to one source only (the principle\nof exclusive allocation). When other sources are resynthesised, there is a hole in their spectrum.\nThis was observed by several researchers (ex: Ellis (1998, pp. 4)) and does not arise only when\nseparation is carried out with CASA, but with ICA (Section 4.3), too (ex: Choi et al. (1999, pp.\n3)3 ). Unfortunately, the models that ASR systems use are based on coding the shape of the whole\nspectrum. Holes in the spectrum (that never occurred during the training) give rise to outliers to\nthe p.d.f. of the spectrum shape. In a typical setup of a contemporary ASR system, an outlier in\nany dimension can seriously reduce the discriminability between the models.\nThe problem is the one of auditory occlusion: the locally loudest source obscures all locally\nquieter sources in the time–frequency representation of the signal. Section 3.2 lists the arguments\nin favour of this observation which is not so intuitive (occlusion in vision seems much more natural).\nCompare for example Figure 4.6 and Figure 4.7. In the former there is no reason to believe that\nthe black lines and the grey fill of the letter shapes continue behind the white background since\nthe white colour can not obscure black colour. However, the reverse is true, and the shapes reveal\nthemselves naturally on the latter figure.\nUsing partial evidence from CASA for ASR\nCooke, Green, Anderson, and Abberley (1994b); Cooke, Crawford, and Green (1994a); Cooke,\nGreen, and Crawford (1994c); Green, Cooke, and Crawford (1995) proposed an alternative integration of CASA with ASR: adapting the ASR system to be able to use partial evidence as\ndelivered by CASA. The underlying assumption is that speech is redundant enough so that it contains enough information for recognition even if occluded. Chapter 3 discusses the assumptions\nand the subsequent work, while the following chapters in this work will detail the techniques and\nexperimental results. It is obvious that the nature of adaptation depends on the architecture of the\nASR system. Cooke et al. (1994b) approach is suited to a HMM based ASR system. Berthomier\net al. (1998) used a multiband hybrid (ANN/ASR) system for recognition of partial speech delivered by a CASA system. The CASA system utilised the harmonicity cue alone for identification\nof the noisy bands. Two to the power of the number of bands recognisers were trained off–line to\ncover every possible combination of noisy bands. After CASA detected the noisy bands, a matched\nclassifier was selected to perform the classification using the clean bands only.\nBut simply ignoring the evidence coming from the other sources may not be the best that can\nbe achieved. The nature of the masker (the object occluding other objects) can put constraints on\nthe nature of the maskees (the obscured objects). I.e. by knowing the masker one may not be able\n3 Wu et al. (1998a) have taken advantage of the exclusive allocation to bootstrap their ICA algorithm\n\n\fCHAPTER 4. MISSING DATA IDENTIFICATION\n\n60\n\nFigure 4.7: Visual occlusion with a hint (compare to Figure 4.6; after Bregman (1990)).\nto determine the “correct” maskee, but it may be able to determine which maskees did not occur.\nThe underlying principle of “auditory induction” was incorporated into a HMM ASR system by\nGreen et al. (1995), and Holmes and Sedgwick (1986) proposed the same technique earlier coming\nfrom entirely different premises and motivation. In any time–frequency representation of speech,\nthe masker puts a higher–bound constraint on what the energy of maskees could have been in that\ntime–frequency point. Barker et al. (2000) used the constraint in a full–blown integrated Viterbi\nsearch for simultaneously finding the most probable grouping and the most probable sentence in\nthe presence of noise.4\n\n4.3\n\nIndependent component analysis for blind source separation\n\nSimulating ASA is not the only way of recovering a signal from a mixture of signals. It can be\nseen as a specialisation of a well researched problem in the signal processing community – the\nproblem of blind source separation (BSS). The problem of BSS is defined as separation (recovery)\nof the signals produced by several sources from their linear mixture, without any knowledge about\nthe sources themselves (hence the term “blind”). In a typical BSS model there are N receivers\npicking up the mixture of the M source signals (N ≥ M ). This is related to the problem of blind\ndeconvolution, which in the simplest case tries to find an inverse of an unknown filter which is\nconvolved with one source (there are also extensions for multiple signals) by observing the resulting\nsignal only. It is also somewhat related to the principal component analysis (PCA): geometrically,\nPCA seeks an orthogonal axis on which the observations are projected, such that the projections\nare uncorrelated (but not necessarily independent). Taking higher order statistics into account,\nthe independent component analysis (ICA) tries to recover the axis of projection not necessarily\ngeometrically orthogonal, but on which the data projections are statistically independent.\nIn the case of instantaneous mixing, and neglecting the noise in the process, the independent component analysis (ICA) assumes the mixing model (see (Hyvarinen, 1999; Lee, 1998) and\nreferences therein):\nx = As\n(4.1)\nwhere s = (s1 , . . . sn )T are the sources which are independent, A is the unknown mixing matrix\nand x = (x1 , . . . xm )T is the observed mixture. The independence of the sources is a stronger\nrequirement then uncorrelation, since it implies:5\nE{g1 (xi )g2 (xj )} − E{g1 (xi )}E{g2 (xj )} = 0\n\nfor i 6= j\n\ninstead of mere E{xi xj } − E{xi }E{xj } = 0 for i 6= j for any functions g1 and q2 .\n4 discussed in more detail in Section 7.2.1\n5 E is the expectation, i.e. E{g(x)} =\n\nR\n\ng(x)p(x)dx\n\n(4.2)\n\n\fCHAPTER 4. MISSING DATA IDENTIFICATION\n\n61\n\nThe aim of ICA is given a set of measurements {x(t)} to recover the the original signals {s(t)}.\nWithout getting too far into the problem of identifiability of the model, it can be said that at most\none source can be Gaussian, usually there have to be more sensors then sources (although some\nsolutions for the reverse case are not impossible) and the mixing matrix must be a full column\nrank. Even then, the matrix A can be recovered only up to a column permutation (the model puts\nno constraint on the order of the sources) and up to a multiplicative constant for each column\n(since it can be cancelled by dividing the corresponding source with it).\nMethods for ICA consist of two major parts:\n• an objective function to measure the amount of independence between the transformed\nmeasurements\n• an algorithm that is used to perform the optimisation\nAs an illustration, we will present the maximum likelihood objective function (since it best suits\nthe probabilistic framework in which the ASR systems are discussed here), and gradient descent\nbased optimisation (since it is the simplest and most often used). We will also assume M = N\nQM\nfor simplicity. Since the sources s are independent, p(s) = i=1 p(si ).

MISSING DATA IDENTIFICATION\n\n62\n\nICA for speech separation\nSeparation of sound sources is one of the classical applications of ICA. Usually the signals are\nseparated in time domain and entirely independently from the ASR system (Lee et al., 1997; Choi\net al., 1999), and then fed into the system. Extended algorithms, handling delays in addition to\nthe mixing between the sources are usually employed in the experiments. This setup is similar to\na real life situation of several sources in a reverberant room. There are known problems with this\napproach:\n(a) the “separated speech” contains low energy regions (“holes” in the spectrum) where the\nother source was dominant. A conventional recogniser can’t handle that naturally. Choi\net al. (1999) resorted to heuristics like thresholding. A missing data recogniser could handle\nthis easily, if the locations of the “holes” were known.\n(b) even after the separation, the interfering source can be heard in the background. The\nrecogniser picks this nevertheless and resulting in a huge number of insertion errors. This\n“cross–hearing” is due to poor separation–this is closely related to the next problem.\n(c) the quality of the separation is limited because the speech model that is used is crude. Even\nmethods that do not explicitly assume the p.d.f. of the sources, do so implicitly (e.g. the\nsquashing non–linearity in (Bell and Sejnowski, 1995) represents the cumulative p.d.f. of\nthe sources, and its a–priori choice amounts to assumption about the form of sources p.d.f.).\nWhen assuming some speech distribution, Laplacian p.d.f. p(x) = α2 e−α|x| (for α > 0) is\nusually chosen to express the sparsity of speech distribution. In contrast, the ASR recogniser\nnot only has an extensive model about the speech distribution(s), but also a dynamic model\nof how the speech source (articulators) change and evolve over time. This is not utilised\nin the separation phase. It has been reported (on non–ASR task) that separation can gain\nsignificantly from a known signal distribution (Torkkola, 1996).\nThese problems are in addition to the problems already inherent to ICA that make the ASR\napplication problematic:\n• needs at least two microphones\n• the resulting unmixing matrix is undetermined up to a scaling factor per column and column\npermutation\nThe latter problems have been addressed by Ikeda and Murata (1999) with some success, as\ndiscussed in the next section. However, it seems that the question of whether it may be better to\nuse a more appropriate model than ICA in the first place is still open.\nICA in the spectral domain\nA possible solution to some of the problems may be to perform the separation in the spectral\ndomain. The accuracy of the separation seems to be much better there (Zibulevsky and Pearlmutter, 1999)8 . Ikeda and Murata (1999) reported on ICA for spectrogram–like speech features.\nThe ambiguity of the scaling factor was resolved by projecting the signals back onto the observations space and comparing the projections with the true observations. The ambiguity of the\npermutation was handled by imposing continuity constraints on the separated signals.\nWu et al. (1998a) used the missing data assumption that only one of the sources is dominant\nin the mixture to speed up the iterative process at no loss of accuracy. Both methods (Ikeda and\nMurata, 1999; Wu et al., 1998a) have also been applied to the case of more signals then sensors.\nIn fact, nothing in the derivation of the learning rule in Eq. (4.6) requires equal or grater number\nof sensors then sources.\n8 The conclusion is based on Figure 7 on page 13. The figure compares the newly proposed method with few\nother ICA methods. However, it is notable that all methods exhibit relative separation errors in the spectral domain\nalmost an order of magnitude smaller than in the time domain\n\n\fCHAPTER 4. MISSING DATA IDENTIFICATION\n\n63\n\nHowever, ICA application on the spectrograms introduces a new problem: treating the bands\nin the spectrogram as independent sources is quite unjustified. But if this constraint is not\nenforced at all, and the assumption that the p.d.f. of the sources is factorisable is removed, then\ninstantaneous ICA degenerates into a Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression (MLLR–commonly\nused for speaker adaptation) with gradient descent search for the best (un)mixing matrix (instead\nof the more usual EM algorithm).\nAn example of a more accurate model would be:\n• for each feature vector x, two subsets of features exist: one subset coming from the speech\nsource, and the other subset generated by the other (noise) source\n• there is an accurate model of the speech source, and no model or very weak model (some\na–priori assumptions like Laplacian density or on–line single channel noise estimation) for\nthe other source\n• the subsets change on a per–frame basis\n• we have prior knowledge that the subsets are usually localised in the time–frequency plane,\ni.e. it is more probable that a whole patch belongs to one source\nThe Multidimensional ICA model (MICA) (Cardoso, 1998) is an extension of ICA for handling\nmultidimensional signals. This is equivalent to assuming that in the unmixed space groups of\nfeatures are going to come from the same source and thus are not going to be independent. MICA\nmodel rewrites the ICA model (Eq. (4.1)) as sum of independent components model (similarly\nto PCA). Unlike ICA, the MICA model is uniquely determined. However, we are not aware of\na general algorithm for MICA. The model was tested by performing ICA on the data first, and\nthen manually selecting the non–independent components to be “merged”. Also, it was assumed\nthat the subsets of the components are constant. In the auditory scene the subsets change on a\nper–frame basis.\n\n4.3.1\n\nICA and CASA\n\nGiven that both CASA and ICA have been applied to the same task of speech separation from\na mixture of sounds, it is interesting to see how they compare. Although both rest on the same\npremise of independence of the physical sources, ICA is more data driven, while CASA is more\nknowledge driven. CASA typically operates with one sensor (or two if binaural cues are used),\nwhile ICA needs two sensors or more. Further, ICA usually needs at least as many sensors as\nsources.\nvan der Kouwe, Wang, and Brown (1999) compared CASA and ICA on a 100 speech and noise\nmixtures from Cooke (1991) (there are 10 voiced utterances mixed with 10 noises). The CASA\nsystem used was a monaural one by Wang and Brown (1999). The ICA algorithm performed joint\napproximate diagonalisation of eigen matrices (JADE) (Cardoso (1997)) on two linear mixtures\nof the speech and the noise. Comparison of the SNR before and after the separation showed that\nCASA performed better then ICA on 2 of the noises, while ICA performed better on the remaining\n8 noises. CASA favoured locally narrowband, continuous and structured noises (1 kHz tone and\nsiren), while ICA performed better on the rest of the noises.\nOkuno et al. (1999) combined CASA and ICA trying to cover their respective weaknesses and\ncombine their advantages. The combined system acted as a speech enhancement preprocessor\nto an ASR system. When used alone, ICA leaded to better accuracy in two–speaker scenes,\nwhile CASA was more successful with three or more speakers. Their combination achieved better\naccuracy then either of them alone.\n\n\fCHAPTER 4. MISSING DATA IDENTIFICATION\n\n4.4\n\n64\n\nNoise and Local Signal-to-Noise Ratio estimation for\nseparation\n\nSingle channel noise and local SNR estimation9 techniques can be used for identification of the reliable parts of the spectrum. Their estimate can be either thresholded yielding hard missing/present\ndata separation, or used as reliability measure of the points in the time–frequency (T–F) plane.\nWe are going to consider the techniques which use a mixture of the signal and the noise to obtain their estimates. Typically they assume the additive speech and noise combination in time\nx(t) = s(t) + n(t) and power spectrum X 2 (w) = S 2 (w) + N 2 (w) domains. They are adaptive\nwithout explicit speech/silence detection.\nMartin (1993, 2001) tracks the minimal envelope of the noisy speech x smoothed power spectrum Ȳx (t):\nYx (t) = Yx (t − 1) + x2 (t) − x2 (t − 1)\nȲx (t) = αȲx (t − 1) + (1 − α)Yx (t)\n\n(4.7)\n\nNext, the time window of approximately L = 0.625 sec is divided in few W (ex: W = 4) smaller\nwindows, and the minimum of the smoothed spectrum Ȳx (t) in each of the windows is determined.\nIf the sequence of the windows minima monotonically increases, then it is assumed that the noise\nincreases rapidly and the minimum of the last window is the noise power. Otherwise, the smallest\nvalue of all windows minimas is the noise power. This value is multiplied by an overestimation\nfactor (from 1.3 to 2, depending on the length of the windows used for power estimation and\nminima calculation), and is bounded from above by the power of the speech plus noise mixture.\nThe estimator is biased when there is no speech present.\nRis and Dupont (2001) used a variant of the same algorithm of minima tracking. For each\nfrequency band, on the basis of N consecutive frames, n (typically n = N/5) minimal values were\naveraged to estimate the noise level in each band.\nHirsch and Enrichter (1995) proposed two algorithms for noise estimation. Both operate on\nthe outputs of a filterbank in the spectral magnitude domain.\nThe first algorithm calculates weighted first order average for each channel separately, on a\nper–sample basis. When the energy in the channel exceeds a certain threshold (the threshold is\nset to be the last computed average scaled by an overestimation factor of β = 1.5 to 2.5), it is\nconsidered that a speech segment starts and the recursive computation is stopped. The calculated\naverage thus far is taken as the value of the noise energy at that moment:\n(\nαN (t − 1, w) + (1 − α)X(t − 1, w) if X(t, w) ≤ βN (t − 1, w)\nN (t, w) =\n(4.8)\nαN (t − 1, w) otherwise\nRis and Dupont (2001) noted that the above method overestimates the noise in low SNR. Therefore\na second order recursion was added to compute the variance of the noise estimate, in addition to\nits mean:\nvarN (t, w) = α var(t − 1, w) + (1 − α)(X(t, w) − N (t, w))2\n(4.9)\nFurther, the frames were grouped in time segments of several frames, the estimates of the mean\nand the variance of the noise were computed on a per segment basis, and for all the frames in the\nnew segment Eq. (4.8) and (4.9) were applied in the frames where:\n|X(t, w) − N (t − 1, w)| ≤ k · σN (w)\n\n(4.10)\n\nwhere σN (w) is the deviation of the previous segment.\nThe second algorithm reported by Hirsch (1993) is based on computing the histograms (with\nroughly 40 bins) of the noisy speech energy which is below the threshold computed with Eq. (4.8)\n9 local SNR estimation refers to estimated SNR in each point in a T–F plane, as opposed to some average of the\nSNR along the time and/or frequency axis\n\n\fCHAPTER 4.

The two bumps notable at 20 dB and 10 dB tend to merge\ninto a single one at 0 dB.\nin each subband over a 400ms time window. The values above a threshold are not take into\naccount – they are considered to belong to speech, not noise. The histograms are computed using\nthe values below threshold for each channel separately. The maximum of the distribution is taken\nto be the value of the noise energy in a particular channel.\nSimilarly, it was noticed that the histograms both of the clean and the noisy subbands feature\ntwo distinct peaks (Ris and Dupont, 2001)10 (Figure 4.8). The low energy mode is related to\nthe presumed speech pauses or noisy frames, and the high energy mode is related to the speech\nframes. The modes are well separated for clean speech and mid–SNRs, and get closer as the SNR\ndecreases. For low SNR they finally merge into one single mode. Therefore, the distributions\nin each band were modelled by two Gaussians and EM and K–means clustering algorithms were\nused to fit a two Gaussians mixture to the histograms. The difference between the means of the\nGaussians is directly related to the local SNR of the noisy speech in each band.\nA method based on subbands quantile11 filtering was reported by Stahl, Fischer, and Bippus\n(2000). Again it is assumed that the speech pauses in the subbands are going to be filled with\nnoise as the noise level increases. Quantile with q = 0.55 was used for the experiments as the\n10 McAulay and Malpass (1980) mention the same idea, the first reference seems to be Roberts (1978); rediscovered\nand reported in length by Ris and Dupont (2001)\n11 q–quantile is the minimum for q = 0, the median for q = 0.5 and the maximum for q = 1\n\n\fCHAPTER 4. MISSING DATA IDENTIFICATION\n\n66\n\nsubband noise estimate. It should be noted that if the window of the analysis is not long enough\nto encompass enough speech silences, then the quantile is essentially going to estimate the speech\n(not the noise), similarly to median smoothing commonly used in image processing to decrease\nthe effect of the impulsive noise.\nAll methods mentioned above rely on the assumption that there are going to be enough frames\nwith silent speech that are going to be filled with noise as the SNR decreases. However, if the\nfrequency resolution is good enough to resolve the harmonics of the F0 , which are going to correspond to the spectral peaks (see Section 3.5.7), the spectral valleys between them are going to\ncontain low speech energy. They are going to fill with noise first, and provide enough data for\nnoise estimation. Therefore, the reliance on speech pauses can be lessened and the segments over\nwhich the histograms and the averages are computed can be shortened. Ris and Dupont (2001)\nused a 64ms long window for this purpose.\nMeyer, Simmer, and Kammeyer (1999) assessed the performance of some of the above algorithms. The task was estimation of the noise given the mixture of clean speech and slowly\namplitude–modulated noise. All algorithms perform bad with rapidly increasing noise and better\nwith decreasing noise. In the latter case, Martin (1993)’s algorithm performed better then Hirsch’s\nweighted algorithm at SNRs close to zero.\nRis and Dupont (2001) tested some of the methods described above with six types of noises,\nboth artificial and realistic. They measured the mean square error (MSE) between the true and\nestimated noise level in the 700 Hz to 1600 Hz region. The results did not indicate any of the the\ntechniques to be a clear winner. Depending on the noise type, different noise estimation methods\ncame best. The only consensus seems to be that all noise estimation methods preferred better\nfrequency then time resolution.\nAny of the above techniques can be used used in an ASR system which can perform classification\nwith partial data. In that case:\n• the negative spectrum (improbable, assuming enough smoothing of the power spectrum) can\nbe treated as missing (Drygajlo and El-Maliki, 1998a)\n• a threshold for the estimated local SNR can be set to to separate the features as present or\nmissing\n• the estimated SNR can be used as a measure of how reliable the feature is\nIn this sense, the local SNR estimation techniques can be used for speech separation.\n\n4.5\n\nSummary\n\nTechniques for speech source separation were discussed in this chapter. CASA uses the low level\nproperties of sound that are believed to be used by humans to facilitate separation. ICA assumes\nindependence of the sources and the way they combine to yield the observations, and then transforms the signals trying to enhance their independence in the transformed space. The local noise\nand SNR estimation estimation techniques use well known heuristics about the speech and the\nnoise to build models of the noise from limited data.\nNone of the techniques claims to be the complete solution to the problem of separation. They\nall have problems hindering their application. However, each on its own may deliver certain\nconstraints that would make the ASR search for the best explanation of the data more accurate.\nFor example, having the missing data of speech in mind, on–line noise estimation might provide\nsome noise model estimate. ICA might use that model together with the speech models of the\nrecogniser to update the probability of two sets of features coming from different sources by\nassessing their independence. CASA might deliver another update of what features are likely to\nhave come from the speech source.12\n12 the speech model p(x , x |S) can not be used to assess the independence of the features x and x\np\nm\np\nm because\nthe xm features have not come from the speech source.; i.e. p(xp , xm ) does not model the joint distribution of the\nspeech and the noise.\n\n\fChapter 5\n\nRobust ASR with missing data in\nan HMM system\n5.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe aim of this chapter is to show how techniques for handling missing and unreliable data can be\nintegrated in today’s standard ASR systems. These systems model the speech source as a Hidden\nMarkov model (HMM). They assume that, during recognition, the data the HMM is matched\nagainst was generated by a single speech source. However, as discussed previously, in most real–\nlife situations this is not true. The observations picked up by a microphone are a mixture of\nseveral sound sources. Human audition has an intriguing property of being able to attend to one\nsource in the mixture alone. The ASR systems fail completely in such conditions. This is not\na fault of the speech HMM. Its parameters were inferred during training with the assumption\nthat all features in the multidimensional observation were generated by the speech source. As\nargued in Chapter 3, a range of phenomena like: (a) easy handling of bandwidth restrictions and\nsevere alterations in time–frequency (T–F) plane; (b) evidence of winner–takes–all physiological\nprocesses; (c) psychoacoustics findings maybe offer an insight into some of the principles that\nunderline the robustness of the human speech recognition (HSR).\nIn this chapter the same principles are applied to a HMM based ASR system. After a brief\nintroduction into the structure of such system, the missing data (MD) model for speech recognition\nis introduced. In addition to the “standard” model of the speech source, the MD model envisages\na model of the mask. The mask model determines the robustness of the speech features. Two\ntechniques can be used to implement the MD model: marginalisation and imputation. They are\nrooted in two complementary statistical approaches for treating missing data. The MD model\naccounts for a non–stationary environment by frame-by-frame on–line adaptation. The aim of the\nadaptation is to match to the speech HMM the features that originated from that speech source\nonly. Features originating from other sources can be matched to their models, if such are available.\nIf not, the MD recogniser can make the best out of the available data. A variant of the MD model\ncan be used for separation, as the separation and the recognition are tied together.\n\n5.2\n\nAn outline of an HMM based ASR system\n\nThe operation of a typical contemporary continuous density HMM based ASR system is depicted\non Figure 5.1 (see any ASR textbook for further references, e.g. Rabiner and Juang (1993)). Each\nHMM model represents a single speech unit. The speech units are usually context sensitive phones\nfor larger vocabulary tasks (e.g. dictation), and whole words for small vocabulary, command–and–\ncontrol type tasks. The architecture of the HMMs (number of states, topology, the parametric\nform of the state p.d.f.s) is decided apriori. The free parameters are the transition probabilities\n\n67\n\n\fCHAPTER 5.

In addition, when HMMs are subword units, a phonetic\ndictionary maps strings of subword units into words. In all but the simplest tasks there exists a\ngrammar – a set of rules about how the words are put together into sentences.\nThere are two modes of operation: training (inference of the unknown system parameters)\nand testing (recognition). In both cases the incoming speech is divided into overlapping frames.\nEach frame is windowed (multiplied with a windowing function) and transformed to yield a feature\nvector. Then during:\nTraining time: The transcription of the utterance hence the corresponding HMM sequence is known\nin advance (but the boundaries between the HMMs need not be known). The HMMs of\nall units in the utterance are concatenated into a composite HMM. An efficient recursive\nforward–backward algorithm iteratively updates the free parameters of the composite\nHMM to increase1 the likelihood of the training data feature vectors. The algorithm\nbelongs to the Expectation–Maximisation (EM) class of algorithms (Dempster et al.\n(1977) – see Section 3.4.1). The hidden variable is the state sequence that the source\nwent through while producing the observations.\nTesting time: For an isolated words ASR with whole word HMMs, the likelihood of each HMM\nproducing the data can be computed. This is known as the forward probability. The\nHMM with the highest score is the recognised word. However, this mode of operation\nis hard to extend to connected word recognition. So instead of taking into account all\npossible paths through the HMM in order to compute the likelihood that the data was\nproduced by the HMM, only the path with the highest likelihood is computed. This is\nknown as a Viterbi search. In practise, the likelihood of the best path (called Viterbi\npath) is so much greater then the likelihoods of all other paths, that picking that score\nalone instead of adding all scores makes little difference. The advantage of the Viterbi\nsearch is that it extends naturally to efficiently handle the connected word recognition\ntask.\nIt is possible to use the Viterbi search during the training, too. In each iteration the data is\naligned to the states on the Viterbi path. All the data deemed to be generated by one state is\n1 more precise, not to decrease\n\n\fCHAPTER 5. ROBUST ASR WITH MISSING DATA IN AN HMM SYSTEM\n\n69\n\npooled together and the parameters of the state p.d.f. are updated to increase the likelihood of\nthat data. The transition probabilities can be updated by merely counting the number of times\nthe particular states transition appears. The process is repeated iteratively, obtaining increasingly\nbetter parameters and better alignment in each iteration. This is known as Viterbi training. It is\nused infrequently because the forward–backward training is efficient enough. Viterbi training can\nbe used to quickly retrain the models when only the feature extraction module of the ASR system\nchanges, or to adapt the system on–line during recognition.2\n\n5.3\n\nThe missing data model for robust speech recognition\n\nThe missing data (MD) model for robust speech recognition assumes that:\n• local patches in some time–frequency representation of the speech spectrum remain mostly\nunaffected by the other sounds even at poor global SNRs\n• they can be identified with a certain probability\n• there is sufficient quantity of information there for recognition of the partial speech\nSo, instead of the usual single source ASR Viterbi decoding:\nW∗\n\n=\n=\n\nargmaxP (W |O) = argmaxP (O|W )P (W )\nW\nW\nX\nargmax\nP (O|Q, W )P (Q|W )P (W )\nW\n\nall Q\n\n≈\n\nargmax argmaxP (O|Q, W )P (Q|W )P (W )\n\n=\n\nargmaxP (O|Q∗ , W )P (Q∗ |W )P (W )\n\nW\n\nQ\n\n(5.1)\n\nW\n\nwhere O is a sequence of observations (data vectors), W is the hypothesised word, W ∗ is the most\nlikely W , Q is a path through the HMM model and Q∗ is the most likely Q, the search in the MD\nmodel is:\nW∗\n\n= argmaxP (W |O) = argmaxP (O|W )P (W )\nW\nW\nX X\n= argmax\nP (O|Q, M, W )P (M |Q, W )P (Q|W )P (W )\nW\n\nall Q all M\n\n≈ argmax argmax\nW\n\n= argmax\nW\n\nQ\n\nX\n\nX\n\nP (O|M, Q, W )P (M |Q, W )P (Q|W )P (W )\n\nall M\n\nP (O|M, Q∗ , W )P (M |Q∗ , W )P (Q∗ |W )P (W )\n\n(5.2)\n\nall M\n\nwhere M is a mask determining which features were generated by the source that is decoded. A\nsimple example of a mask would be a binary matrix. The MD model makes provision for multiple\nsources via the mask. The mask captures the prior information about:\n• how reliable the features are\n• which combinations of features tend to “stick together” above the noise\n2 The relation between Viterbi and Baum-Welch training is similar to the one between the K-means and EM\nalgorithms for fitting mixtures of Gaussian to data. The former algorithms assume hard decision, i.e. the data was\neither generated or not generated by the state/mixture. The latter allow for every point to have been generated by\nevery state/mixture with a certain probability.\n\n\fCHAPTER 5. ROBUST ASR WITH MISSING DATA IN AN HMM SYSTEM\n\n70\n\nFeatures deemed to have been generated by the (speech) source of interest will be refereed to as\n“present” and indicated accordingly by the binary mask. Features deemed to have been generated\nby other source(s) which are not of direct interest for the ASR system will be refereed to as\n“missing”.\nAn alternative form for Eq. (5.2) is:\nW∗\n\n= argmaxP (W |O) = argmaxP (O|W )P (W )\nW\nW\nX X\n= argmax\nP (O|Q, M, W )P (Q|M, W )P (M |W )P (W )\nW\n\n≈ argmax\nW\n\nall Q all M\n\nX\n\nP (O|M, Q∗ , W )P (Q∗ |W )P (M |W )P (W )\n\n(5.3)\n\nall M\n\nwhere it is assumed that the path Q is independent of the mask M (hence P (Q|M, W ) = P (Q|W )).\nIn this form the mask M is conditioned on the word W , but not on the state path Q.\nThe factors in the expression above represent:\nP (W )\n\nthe probability of the word regardless of the acoustic observations (comes\nfrom the language model)\n\nP (Q∗ |W )\n\nthe probability of the most likely path Q∗\n\nP (M |Q∗ , W )\n\n(or P (M |W )) the probability of the mask (determining which features\nwere generated by the state or the word)\n\nP (O|M, Q∗ , W )\n\nthe probability of the partial observations\n\nFigure 5.2 shows a mask example. In the top row, the left panel shows a clean speech TIdigits (Leonard, 1984) digits utterance (“1159”). It is mixed with NOISEX factory noise (Varga\net al., 1992) shown in the middle panel. The right panel depicts the noisy speech at global SNR of\n0dB. The representation is a smoothed 64–channel auditory filter bank (centre frequencies spaced\nlinearly in ERB-rate from 50 to 8000Hz), computed every 10ms (Cooke, 1991).\nThe panels in the middle depict three different masks. The red areas in the masks indicate\npresence of speech in the noisy signal, while the blue regions indicate absence of speech. The masks\nare derived assuming additivity of the speech and the noise in the power spectral domain. The left\none is derived by comparing the clean and the noisy speech, and selecting as speech points those\nwith local SNR of 7dB and more. The middle one is derived from a local SNR estimate, based on\na stationary noise estimate from the noisy speech (with the same 7dB threshold criterion). The\nright one is derived by comparing the speech estimate used for spectral subtraction (SS) and noisy\nspeech and treating the points where speech estimate is smaller then the noisy speech as non–\nspeech. The panels in the bottom row show the noisy speech as “seen through” the corresponding\nmasks. They illustrate that even at SNR of 0dB, with on average equally loud speech and noise,\nlarge parts of speech spectrum are unaffected.\nSeparation with the MD model\nThe MD model for robust ASR integrates the separation of the speech and the noise with the\nrecognition of the speech. Finding the mask amounts to separation of the speech and the noise.\nThe ML mask M ∗ is:\nM∗\n\n= argmaxP (M |O) = argmaxP (O, M )\nM\nM\nX X\nP (O|M, Q, W )P (M |Q, W )P (Q|W )P (W )\n= argmax\nM\n\nall W all Q\n\n≈ argmaxP (O|M, Q∗ , W ∗ )P (M |Q∗ , W ∗ )P (Q∗ |W ∗ )P (W ∗ )\nM\n\n(5.4)\n\n\fCHAPTER 5.

The combination of speech and noise in a all–or–\nnothing manner (each feature is generated by the speech or the noise exclusively) is a significant\nsimplification. It may not be a viable one for a complicated environment with convolutional noise\nand/or reverberation. But for additive noise it is largely appropriate for several reasons already\ndiscussed in Section 3.2. Experimental comparisons with techniques like PMC do not indicate\nperformance loss due to this simplification (Renevey, 2000, pp. 149). Further:\n• The small difference in performance of multiconditional models on seen and unseen noises (Hirsch\nand Pearce, 2000) may suggest that there is insufficient structure in the noises to infer strong\n\n\fCHAPTER 5. ROBUST ASR WITH MISSING DATA IN AN HMM SYSTEM\n\n72\n\nnoise models/constraints. This supports the argument that the rich speech structure should\nbe the primary source of constraints needed for separation.\n• The speech and the noise are independent sources (i.e. the mutual information is zero). The\nonly way in which the noise source constrains the speech source is through the environmental\nfunction that combines the observations generated from both sources into a noisy observation. The MD model can capture most of this information via the usage of counterevidence\n(Section 5.5.7), if the variance of the noise is reasonably large, as is the case for most of the\nnoises.\nChapter 7 contains more detailed discussion about the relative merits on the noise models and\ncounterevidence in Section 7.2.4.\n\n5.4\n\nModelling the mask\n\nThe introduction of a mask decomposes the problem of robust ASR3 into two subproblems: separation and recognition. Contrary to some other models (e.g. HMM decomposition), where decoding\none source implies decoding all sources, the mask allows for decoding of one source only while\ndisregarding the other sources present in the auditory scene.\nAt present it is unclear which is the most appropriate form for the mask model.\nWhile experimenting, it is useful to use oracle masks (Figure (5.2), left panel of the middle\nrow). They can be computed by comparing the clean speech and noise4 . This is helpful while\nevaluating different strategies for computing the likelihood of the partial data P (O|M, Q, W ), since\nthe influence of imperfect separation is minimised. It can also provide an idea about the upper\nlimits on the performance that can be achieved. The oracle mask M ∗ has probability of 1 and is\nindependent of Q∗ and W .\nFor “production” ASR, local SNR estimation based on noise estimation (Figure (5.2), middle\npanel of the middle row) was used to compute the mask model in the experiments (see Chapter 6).\nIdeally, CASA would be the method of choice for building this model. Barker et al. (2001b) have\nsuccessfully merged the former with elements of the latter (harmonicity based masks) in their\nsystem. Seltzer et al. (2000) used a static classifier for mask estimation with good results, roughly\nhalf way between the noise estimation results and results with “oracle” masks. Roweis (2000)\nused speaker dependent HMMs to learn speaker dependent mask models solely for the purpose of\nseparation and (successful) reconstruction.\nFaced with integrating several sources of evidence, the most plausible route seems a statistical\nmodel. Chapter 7 discusses further the issues pertinent to building a mask model and the properties\nthat would be desirable for the model to have.\n\n5.4.1\n\nComputing the sum over all possible masks\n\nApproximation\nThe summation for all M in Eqs. (5.2) and (5.3) is over all possible masks. In general, the\nnumber of possible masks per frame is prohibitively large: two to the power of number of features.\nHowever, under assumptions similar to ones leading to the Viterbi approximation in Eq. (5.1):\n(a) the most likely (ML)5 mask M ∗ will be much more likely than any other mask M , i.e.\nP (M ∗ |Q∗ , W ) À P (M |Q∗ , W ) for M 6= M ∗\n(b) the likelihoods of the data that the corresponding masks will give rise to (P (O|M ∗ , Q∗ , W )\nand P (O|M, Q∗ , W )) will behave similarly, i.e. P (O|M ∗ , Q∗ , W ) À P (O|M, Q∗ , W ) for\nM 6= M ∗\n3 when viewed as decoding one source while listening to several\n4 or clean and noisy speech – but then a model of acoustic environment is needed to derive the SNR\n5 ML will be used both for “most likely” and “maximum likelihood”\n\n\fCHAPTER 5. ROBUST ASR WITH MISSING DATA IN AN HMM SYSTEM\n\n73\n\nThe summation over all possible masks (weighted by their probability) may be approximated by\nselection of the most probable mask M ∗ :\nW∗\n\nargmaxP (O|M ∗ , Q∗ , W )P (M ∗ |Q∗ , W )P (Q∗ |W )P (W )\n\n≈\n\n(5.6)\n\nW\n\nor its analog for Eq.

(5.1)). The likelihood of the\nfeatures not generated by this (or any other HMM model available) is small and may be neglected\nin the sum.\nExact calculation in a special case\nIn the special case when both the state and the mask p.d.f.s are sums of factorisable distributions,\nand when the independence assumptions are taken into account (see Section 5.5), an efficient\ncomputation of the sum over all possible masks in Eq. (5.2) is possible (Appendix D, Eq. (D.5)):\n∗\n\nW = argmax\nW\n\n= argmax\nW\n\n= argmax\nW\n\n½Y\nT\n\n¾\n∗\n\np(o(t)|q (t), W ) · P (Q∗ |W )P (W )\n\nt=1\n\n¾\np(o(t), m(t)|q (t), W ) · P (Q∗ |W )P (W )\n\n½Y\nT X\n\n∗\n\n(5.8)\n\nt=1 allm\n\n½Y\nT X\nt=1 k\n\nP (k)\n\nY\n\n[pi (oi (t)|k, mi (t) = 0, q ∗ (t), W )p(mi (t) = 0|q ∗ (t), W )\n\ni\n\n¾\n+ pi (oi (t)|k, mi (t) = 1, q ∗ (t), W )p(mi (t) = 0|q ∗ (t), W )] · P (Q∗ |W )P (W )\nThe result is intuitive: the contribution of the present and missing features to the likelihood\nshould be weighted by the probability of them being present or missing. A discrete mask is a\nspecial case where the probabilities of a feature present/missing is either 0 or 1. The missing\nfeatures (observations generated by the non–speech source) can still contribute to the likelihood of\nthe speech source model – their contribution can be exploited as counterevidence (Section 5.5.7).\n\n5.5\n\nComputing the likelihood of the partial observations\n\nAssuming that O = {o(t)}t=1...T , Q = {q(t)}t=1...T and M = {m(t)}t=1...T where t is the time\nframe, T is the total number of frames, o(t) is the observation vector, q(t) is the state the speech\nsource was in at time t and m(t) is the framewise mask for frame t, the mask m(t) divides the\nfeature vector x into a present part xp and a missing part xm at time t.7 This means that\nthe observation o(t) was only partly generated by the speech source in state q(t). The feature\nsubvector op (t) of the vector o(t) was generated by the speech source that is being decoded (and\na model is certainly available). The remaining subvector om (t) was generated by some other,\npossibly noise, source. A model of this source might, or might not, be available.\nTaking into account the independence assumptions:\n6 a “folk conjecture” in the ASR community is that transition probabilities are unimportant in the overall\nlikelihood compared to the emission probabilities; however, it is the “ordering” of the HMM states enforced by\nfixing most of the transition probabilities to zero that yields advantage over a mere mixture model.\n7 o(t) is the realisation of the random variable x at time t\n\n\fCHAPTER 5. ROBUST ASR WITH MISSING DATA IN AN HMM SYSTEM\n\n74\n\n• the observations are independent, i.e. o(t) is independent of o(t − 1)\n• each observation o(t) is dependent only on the state q(t)\nThe likelihood of the partial data P (O|M, Q, W ) from Eq.

It divides the observation random variable x\ninto a present part xp and a missing part xm :\nx = (xp , xm )\n\n(5.10)\n\nAs mentioned in Chapter 3, knowing the probability distribution of the whole observation, there\nare two possible ways to compute the probability of the partial observation: marginalisation and\nimputation. In the case of marginalisation the probability distribution itself is adapted to yield\nthe distribution of the partial data. In the case of imputation, the conditional distribution of\nthe unobserved given the observed data is computed from the joint distribution, and a “suitable”\npoint on the curve is picked as a plug–in replacement of the unobserved data. Then the joint data\ndistribution can be used to asses the probability “full” data vector. These strategies are discussed\nnext in the context of an HMM based ASR system.\n\n5.5.1\n\nMarginalisation in an HMM based MD ASR system\n\nDropping the conditioning on W and time index t where not necessary and replacing the probability\ndistribution P with probability density distribution p to suit a continuous random variable x, the\nfactor P (o|m, q) from Eq. (5.9) becomes (Ahmad and Tresp, 1993):\nZ\np(o|m, q) = p(op |q) = p(op , xm |q)dxm\n(5.11)\nwhere xm is a subvector of x completely determined by the mask m. Depending on m, different\nsets of features need to be marginalised in each frame.\nThe state p.d.f. in a typical HMM system is a mixture of multivariate diagonal Gaussians:\np(x|q) =\n\nK\nX\n\nP (k|q)p(x|k, q) =\n\nk=1\n\nK\nX\n\nP (k|q)\n\nN\nY\n\np(xi |k, q)\n\n(5.12)\n\ni=1\n\nk=1\n\nwhere p(xi |k, q) is a univariate Gaussian:\n1\n\np(xi |k, q) = q\n2\n2πσi,k\n\n(\n\n1\nexp −\n2\n\nµ\n\nxi − µi,k\nσi,k\n\n¶2 )\n(5.13)\n\nThe assumption that the state p.d.f. can be modelled by a Gaussian mixture with diagonal\ncovariance matrices is crucial for practical implementation of a MD ASR system. Both for MD\nand non–MD ASR system the number of free parameters (and consequently the amount of data\nneeded for their estimation) is significantly smaller. Further, sufficient number of components in\nthe mixture can approximate not only rotation of the distribution (that full covariance matrix can\nmodel as well), but also non–Gaussian distributions and/or multimodal distributions (that full\ncovariance matrix can not model). In addition, while still\np(xp , xm |q) 6= p(xp |q)p(xm |q),\n\n(5.14)\n\n\fCHAPTER 5.

As it can not be easily derived from Σ−1 with a general\ncovariance matrix8 , a matrix inversion per state per frame is needed to adapt the HMM system\nin every frame. This is very costly.\nBut, if all pairs of features are mutually independent, implying a diagonal covariance matrix\n(only the variances are non–zero) the state p.d.f. marginal Eq.

It simply states that only the contributions (to the\nlikelihood) of the present features need to be taken into account.\n\n5.5.2\n\nImputation in an HMM based MD ASR system\n\nThe second strategy for computing the likelihood of partial observations p(o|m, q) from Eq. (5.9)\n(see Section 5.5) is to “fill in”, impute the missing observations using the knowledge of the data\ndensity, and then continue as if the imputed features were the “true” (but the unobserved) ones.9\nThe non–speech observations om (t) are disregarded as they are not generated from the speech\nsource. Instead, estimates ôm (t) are obtained and used further. It seems natural to use some form\nof conditional data distribution p(xm (t)|xp (t)) to come up with a “sensible” ôm (t) to impute.\nIn the context of an HMM based recogniser, there are two possible conditional distributions\nthat can be used to draw the imputed values from: the data distribution p(xm |xp ) or the state\nconditioned data distribution p(xm |xp , q). In the former case there is a single value which is\n−1\n−1\n8 For example, (Σ−1 )\n−1 , (Σ−1 )\n−1 , etc.\npp = (Σpp − Σpm Σmm Σmp )\nmm = (Σmm − Σmp Σpp Σpm )\n9 imputation makes sense only with generative models; if the data density is not inferred during the training, then\n\nit needs to be inferred separately solely for the purpose of imputation, as is the case with the hybrid, non–HMM\nbased ASR systems, e.g. (Dupont, 1998)\n\n\fCHAPTER 5. ROBUST ASR WITH MISSING DATA IN AN HMM SYSTEM\n\n76\n\nimputed. This case will be labelled Global Data Imputation (GDI). In the latter case as many\nvalues can be imputed as there are states resulting in as many different frames. This may seem as\nunsurmountable difficulty. However, during the Viterbi search, when estimating the probability\nthat a particular frame was generated by a particular state, not all frames need to be assessed. It\nis enough to compute the likelihood of the frame whose missing values were imputed from that\nstate conditional p.d.f. The rationalisation being that it is already assumed that the speech source\nwas in that particular state. This case will be termed State conditioned Data Imputation (SDI).\n\n5.5.3\n\nGlobal data imputation\n\nComputing the data distribution p(xm |xp ) in an HMM based system is straightforward, as all\nstate conditioned distributions are available. Hence:\np(xm |xp ) =\n\nX\n\np(xm , q|xp ) =\n\nall q\n\n=\n\nX\n\np(xm |xp , q)p(q|xp ) =\n\nall q\n\nP\n\nX\nall q\n\np(xm |xp , q)\n\np(xp |q)P (q)\np(xp )\n\np(xp |q)P (q)p(xm |xp , q)\nX\np(xp |q)P (q)\nall q\nP\np(xm |xp , q) P\n=\np(xp |q 0 )P (q 0 )\np(xp |q)P (q)\n\nall q\n\nall q 0\n\n(5.20)\n\nall q\n\nThe form simply states that the conditional p.d.f. p(xm |xp ) is a sum of state conditioned condip(xp |q)P (q)\ntional p.d.f.s p(xm |xp , q), weighted by a factor P\n0\n0 .\n0 p(xp |q )P (q )\nall q\n\n5.5.4\n\n“Probability of a state”\n\nThe prior probability of the state q, P (q), can either be computed exactly, by the recursive:10\nP (q) =\n\nT\nX\nt=1\n\nP (q(t) = q) =\n\nT X\nX\n\nP (q(t − 1) = q 0 )P (q(t) = q|q(t − 1) = q 0 )\n\n(5.21)\n\nt=1 allq 0\n\nor approximately, as the relative frequency with which the state q appears in the state aligned\ntraining data. In the case of a straight–through HMM (HMM with no skip states, which is commonly used for speech recognition) the latter can be derived from the transition probabilities11\nas:\n1/[1 − s(q)]\nP (q) = P\n(5.22)\n0\nall q 0 1/[1 − s(q )]\nwhere s(q) is the probability\nP that the speech source stays in state q once it is in it P (q(t) =\nq|q(t − 1) = q), the sum all q0 is over all states (across HMM models) and it is assumed that\nthere is no grammar (every word/HMM sequence is equally likely).\nIn almost all continuous–density (CD) HMM based ASR systems the state p.d.f.s p(x|q) are\nmixtures of diagonal Gaussians (Eq. (5.12)). Considering the somewhat more general case of a\n10 abusing the notation for consistency – q stands for a particular state (a realisation of a random variable) while\nq(t) stands for the state the source is in time t (a random variable)\n11 The transition probabilities may be derived themselves from the state aligned training data. Absence of skip\nstate makes thePreverse computation possible: the expected number of frames N (q) generated from state q is\nn\nE{N (q)} = 1 + ∞\nn=0 n[s(q)] [1 − s(q)], where the 1 comes from the straight through HMM (the model must pass\nthrough each state at least once) and the infinite sum is the expected number of frames the source remains in state\nq once it is in it. The infinite sum evaluates to s(q)/[1 − s(q)], giving rise\nPto E{N (q)} = 1/[1 − s(q)] and leading to\nEq. (5.22) which uses the expected number of frames P (q) = E{N (q)}/ q0 E{N (q 0 )} instead of relative frequency\n\n\fCHAPTER 5.

The weights depend on the prior probability of the mixture P (k|q)\n(state dependent) in addition to the prior state probability P (q) and the probability of the present\ndata p(xp |k, q).\nIt is not immediately clear how to choose a point from this manifold. The “natural” criterion\nmaybe to choose the global maximum, as it is the most likely point. However, it can not be easily\ndetermined. Another point of choice may be the conditional mean. It has an appealing property\nthat it minimises the quadratic error, and is easily computable:\nP\n\nZ\nExm |xp {xm }\n\n=\n\np(xm |xp )xm dxm =\nP\n\n=\n\nP (q)\n\nz\nZ\n\nP\n\nall q\n\nk\n\n{\n\nk\n\nP (q) P (k|q)p(xp |k, q)µm,k,q\nk\nP\nP\nP (q) P (k|q)p(xp |k, q)\n\nall q\n\nall q\n\n}|\n\nP (k|q)p(xp |k, q) p(xm |k, q)xm dxm\nP\nP\nP (q) P (k|q)p(xp |k, q)\n\nall q\n\nP\n\nµm,k,q\n\n(5.24)\n\nk\n\nThe form is a weighed sum of the means of the missing components. The drawback is that if the\nGaussians are far apart and the distribution is multimodal, the mean may fall in a region of very\nlow probability. If, however, most of the Gaussians are “stacked” close together for the purpose\nof approximating a non–Gaussian distribution which has few modes, imputing the mean maybe\nappropriate.\nThe “imputed” missing observations ôm = Exm |op {xm } can be used instead of the noisy ones\nom and subsequent recognition can continue with the “complete” data vector ô = (op , ôm ) instead\nof o.\n\n5.5.5\n\nState dependent data imputation\n\nWhen computing the emission probability for a state q it is assumed that the source is in that\nstate. Hence the state conditioned p.d.f. p(x|q) is used for computing the probability that the\nobservation was generated by that state. Analogous, if some of the observations are missing,\nand it is assumed that the source us in state q, it maybe preferable to use the state conditioned\nconditional data density p(xm |xp , q) instead of the conditional data density p(xm |xp ), for the\npurpose of imputation.

However,\n\n\fCHAPTER 5. ROBUST ASR WITH MISSING DATA IN AN HMM SYSTEM\n\n79\n\nif the Gaussians approximate possibly a non–Gaussian distribution which is not too multimodal,\nthe mean may be a good choice (as illustrated on the lower panel of Fig. (5.3)).\nIn both cases the global maximum is close to the means of the individual Gaussians. In the\nupper panel of Fig. (5.3) (components far apart), it almost coincides with the highest mean in the\nmixture. It in the lower panel of Fig. (5.3) (components stacked together), it is a bit further from\nthe highest mean. In any case, the means of the individual Gaussians may be a good starting point\nfor the search for the global maximum (Carreira-Perpiñán, 1999). But still, the global maximum\ndoes not coincide with the “true value” all the time (just most of the time), so the reconstruction\nis not from perfect.\nAfter the ôm,q is computed, the emission probability of each state can be computed as p(ôm,q , op |q)\nand the decoding can continue.\n\n5.5.6\n\nMarginalisation or imputation?\n\nIt is of interest to consider under which conditions one of the techniques is more preferable to the\nother.\nMarginalisation is computationally cheaper and there are no problems like the choice of criterion for picking a point on the conditional p.d.f. in the imputation. In our experiments the ASR\naccuracy was always better with marginalisation then with imputation.\nImputation provides reconstruction of the unobserved data in addition to recognition. The\nreconstruction task is not trivial. Many imputed values will give rise to the “correct likelihood”,\nalthough only one is “correct”. While marginalisation effectively averages the likelihood over all\nof the possible imputations (see Eq. (5.29)below), the imputation process has to pick only a single\nvalue to be imputed. The fact that many other are also possible (if less probable) is disregarded.\nStill, some non–HMM ASR systems may require complete(d) feature vectors because they can not\nbe adapted. Sometimes the adaptation is not trivial (as is the case with the hybrid ones), or the\nrecogniser is entirely separate subsystem treated like a “black box”. In that case imputation can\nbe the method of choice.\nIt is also possible to use both techniques in a complementary manner, if both recognition and\nreconstruction are required: marginalisation can be used to obtain the most likely state sequence.\nOnce the sequence is known, the conditional state p.d.f.s may be used for imputation.\nIt seems that both techniques are somewhat dependent on the amount of data the mask “lets\nin”. In the ASR experiments it was notable that for marginalisation it is better to impose a more\nstringent assessment about the reliability of the features. While for imputation it was better to\nloosen the criterion and treat more of the features as more reliable (compared to marginalisation).\nIt seems it is hard to impute sensibly the majority of the features in the vector if only small\nminority of them are present. In the most extreme cases when where only couple of features are\npresent, it may be preferable to delete the whole frame altogether (frame deletion), rather then\ntrying to salvage it. The exact relationship between the data “quality” and “quantity” in the\ncontext of robust ASR is not clear at present.\nAs mentioned in Section 3.3.2, there is an intuitive connection between the marginalisation of\nthe state conditioned p.d.f. p(xp , xm |q) and the imputation from the state conditioned conditional\ndistribution p(xm |xp , q). The marginal p(xp |q) can be considered an average over all possible conditional imputations p(xp |xm , q) weighted by their respective probabilities of occurrence p(xm |q):\nZ\np(xp |q) = p(xp |xm , q)p(xm |q)dxm\n(5.29)\n\n5.5.7\n\nCounterevidence\n\nAlthough the missing observations om (t) were not generated by the speech source that is decoded,\nthey can still be used to derive information about which states are unlikely to have generated the\nobservations. This is an important constraint when no noise model is available. The commonly\nused models of speech and noise mixing:\n\n\fCHAPTER 5.

This can be used to score the states on how likely they are to have produced an observation\nbelow om (t) (Holmes and Sedgwick, 1986; Cooke et al., 1994a; Green et al., 1995):\nZ om\np(om |q) =\np(xm |q)dxm\n(5.30)\n−∞\n\nR\n\nwhere p(xm |q) = p(xp , xm |q)dxp is itself a marginal p.d.f.\nAdditionally, in the log–spectral domain the energies should be positive, assuming that only\nthe compressive domain range [1, +∞) of the logarithm function is used. So a stricter:\nZ om\np(xm |q)dxm\n(5.31)\np(om |q) =\n0\n\ncan be used.12 For imputation, bounding the marginal in the denominator of Eq. 5.26 and constraining the imputed values to fall within the range also improves the results (Cooke et al.,\n2001).\nThe marginal p.d.f.s for xp and xm need not be computed separately. The additional knowledge\nabout the admissible range of xm can be utilised directly:\nZ om\np(op , xm ∈ [0, om ]|q) =\np(xp , xm |q)dxm\n0\nZ om\nX\n=\nP (k|q)p(op |k, q)\np(xm |k, q)dxm\n(5.32)\nk\n\n0\n\n12 strictly, the p.d.f. should be truncated at 0, but the truncated forms are inconvenient to work with and the\nprobability mass left of 0 is negligible in most of the cases\n\n\fCHAPTER 5. ROBUST ASR WITH MISSING DATA IN AN HMM SYSTEM\n\n81\n\nP\nwhere it is assumed that p(x|q) is a sum of factorisable distributions, p(x|q) = k P (k|q)p(x|k, q).\nFor the special case of Gaussians with diagonal covariance matrices it can be evaluated by:\n(\n)\nX\nY\nY\nom − µm,k\n−µm,k\n2\np(op , xm ∈ [0, om ]|q) = 0.5\nP (k|q)\nN (op ; µp,k,q , σp,k,q )\nerf ( √\n) − erf ( √\n)\n2 σm,k,q\n2 σm,k,q\np\nm\nk\n(5.33)\nwhere the error function erf (x) is defined as:\n2\nerf (x) = √\nπ\n\nZ x\n\n2\n\ne−t dt.\n\n(5.34)\n\n0\n\nThe assumption that Gaussians in the mixture are diagonal allows for the closed form solution.\nIn the case of non–diagonal Gaussians the integral in Eq. (5.32) doesn’t have a convenient\nclosed form solution. The covariance can be “diagonalised” with a suitable linear transform of the\nvariables of integration. But then the variables of integration appear in the bounds. So it is not\npossible to decompose the multivariate integral into a form involving only one dimensional ones\n(like in Eq. (5.33)). The solution has to be either approximated (as in Morris et al. (1998)) or\nevaluated with Monte-Carlo type methods (Genz, 1992, 1993) which are unsuitable for ASR due\nto computational constraints.13\nCounterevidence with marginalisation\nUsing counterevidence with marginalisation is straightforward. Instead of p(o|m, q) = p(op |q)\n(Eq. (5.11)) for the state p.d.f. of the HMM system, a more constrained:\np(o|m, q) = p(op , xm ∈ [0, om ])\n\n(5.35)\n\nis used.\nCounterevidence with data imputation\nCounterevidence can be used twice with data imputation (we will apply it only to state dependent\ndata imputation, Section 5.5.5).\nFirstly, when the conditional p.d.f. is computed, instead of p(xm |xp , q) (Eq. (5.25)) we have:\np(xm |xp , xm ∈ [0, om ], q) =\n\np(xm , xp |q)\np(xp , xm ∈ [0, om ]|q)\n\n(5.36)\n\nThe integral in the denominator becomes a bounded one taking into account the bounds constraint.\nSecondly, when a point from the conditional p.d.f. above is drawn, it has to be in the [0, om ]\ninterval. Regardless of whether a mean or a mode is imputed, one has to consider the case when\nthe chosen point is not in the interval of [0, om ]. In our experiments (see Section 6.3.2) the highest\npoint among all Gaussians in the mixture that is within the bounds was chosen as a value to be\nimputed.\nThe relative merits of evidence and counterevidence\nThere is an inherent problem in mixing the contributions of the present and the missing features\ntogether: the former are likelihoods, i.e. points on the p.d.f. curve (and can take any value),\nwhile the latter are true probabilities, i.e. points on the c.d.f. curve. If the mask is discrete (i.e.\nprobabilities of present and missing data p(m = 0) and p(m = 1) are either 0 or 1) the scores used\nin the Viterbi search during the decoding need not be correct up to a scaling factor, as long as\n13 the form is the same as one discussed in the Appendix C which arises in the case of a linear transform of the\nfeature vector\n\n\fCHAPTER 5. ROBUST ASR WITH MISSING DATA IN AN HMM SYSTEM\n\n82\n\nthe factor is the same for all states. The optimal path does not change when the likelihoods of all\nstates are scaled by the same factor. Hence using the curve (a) or (b) from Fig. (5.4) makes no\ndifference to the winning path if the mask is discrete . Even with non–discrete mask the difference\nin the contributions of the counterevidence to different states is small.\nFigure 5.4 plots an example of three different ways of mixing the evidence from the present\nand missing data, together with the original Gaussian p(x|q). It’s notable that the shape of the\ncurves is virtually identical. The main difference is in the scores at high valued observations o\n(disregarding the scaling factor between them). Curve (c) was found to perform poorer then (a)\nand (b) in our experiments. Both (a) and (b) perform identically for ordinary Viterbi single–source\nsearch. Barker et al. (2000) reported problems with (b) in the multisource decoder, as different\npaths in this decoder see the data differently (as present or missing, with discrete mask). The\nproblem was circumvented by either using an empirically established scaling constant, or by using\nthe “average likelihood” (curve (a)).\nThe problem of the relative contributions of the present and missing data is a reminiscent of\nthe problem of using the acoustic and the language model in the ASR system together, when they\nwere estimated separately.14 The probabilities given by the acoustic model are overoptimistic,\nmost probably due to the assumption that the frames are independent. The “fudge factor” γ (in\naddition to some other empirically derived parameters, like the word insertion penalty) is used as\nin:\nW ∗ = argmaxP (O|W )P (W )γ\n(5.37)\nW\n\ninstead of Eq. (5.1) to weight the relative contributions between the evidence from the acoustic\nand the language models. These “adjustment factors” are usually tuned to minimise the word\nerror rate (WER) on a separate, “development” test set. Then their “optimal” values are used in\nthe final evaluation of the ASR system on a different “evaluation” test set.\nIf both the mask and the speech models are estimated jointly, then usage of such empirical\nfactors may be avoided. The average likelihood (a) maybe the safest choice for expressing the\ncounterevidence, as it at least keeps the score “dimensionally correct”, was shown to work well\nin the multisource decoder (Barker et al., 2000) and doesn’t hinder the performance of the single\nsource Viterbi decoder as the “self–weighted likelihood” (c) does.\n\n5.6\n\nSummary\n\nTechniques that cater for missing and unreliable data were integrated into an HMM based ASR\nsystem in this chapter. The adaptation enables the system that models a single speech source\nto handle observations that are a mixture of several sources. This is achieved without explicit\nmodels for all of them, nor their decoding in parallel. The approach is inspired by the HSR which\nseems able to attend to one source in the mixture alone, neglecting the others. The MD model for\nspeech recognition introduces the notion of a mask as a random variable, whose constraints can be\ncaptured by an appropriate model. It is further discussed how marginalisation and data imputation\ncan be used to implement the adaptation of the speech HMM. The changes needed in the HMM\nbased system are fairly straightforward. The role of counterevidence and how it fits in an HMM\nsystem is also explored. The implementation makes use of the function of acoustic environment\nto circumvent the need for explicit noise models, while still capturing most of the constraints. It\nalso makes use of the special forms both of the speech and the mask model (factorisable or sum\nof factorisable p.d.f.s) to achieve efficient computation of the mask conditioned likelihoods.\n\n14 in addition, most often, when the acoustic model is estimated the wrong criterion is optimised: the likelihood\nis maximised instead of minimising the word error rate\n\n\fChapter 6\n\nExperiments\n6.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe aim of this chapter is to present the results of the experiments with the Missing Data (MD)\nASR system. The connected digits task was chosen to test the techniques which is a de–facto\nstandard test for robust ASR. It has the advantage that whole word models suffice (there is no\nneed for phonetic dictionary) and there is no language model. Arguably, it is still a non–trivial\ntask, while leaving out components of the ASR system that have less influence on the robustness of\nthe system. The speech data was artificially contaminated with various noises at different SNRs.\nThe MD ASR system was an HMM based one, employing a textbook training procedures (Young\nand Woodland, 1993) during models training and a textbook in–house Viterbi decoder during\nthe recognition (in several different implementations). The MD system was tested in various\nconfigurations. The features were constrained to be in frequency domain, as the mask estimation\nand recognition used the same features. The experiments included filterbanks (24 channels),\nratemaps (32 and 64 channels) both with or without the first derivatives. The mask estimation\nin the experiments still makes use of a noise estimate. A weak noise model was estimated on–line\nduring the recognition. It was mostly stationary, i.e. constant for the duration of the utterance.\nApriori mask (which requires knowledge of the clean speech) was used to get an indication of the\nperformance that may be achieved with very good separation. Both marginalisation and data\nimputation were tried for computing the likelihood of the partial data in the initial experiments.\nIn the latter set of experiments the marginalisation technique only was used, as it is faster and\ndata reconstruction was not required by the task.\n\n6.2\n\nDescription of the MD ASR system and the corpora\n\nAn HMMs based ASR system in various configurations, adapted to handle missing and unreliable\ndata, was used for all experiments reported in this chapter. The system was trained and tested\non the TIdigits database (Leonard, 1984) mixed with Lynx helicopter and factory noise from the\nNOISEX database (Varga et al., 1992), as well as TIdigits’ noisy variant Aurora 2 (Hirsch and\nPearce, 2000).\nThe TIdigits database consists of digit strings containing between one and seven digits (“1”\nto “9”, “oh”, “zero”) recorded in quiet conditions and sampled at 20 kHz. The male and female\ncorpora (leaving out the digits strings spoken by children) were used together (no gender dependent\nmodelling) both for training and testing. The “canonical” TIdigits trainset (all clean speech) was\nused for training.\nLynx helicopter noise from NOISEX was used as an example of stationary, and the factory\nnoise as an example of non–stationary noise. They were both added with random starting points\nat SNRs from +20dB to -5dB to a subset of the TIdigits test set consisting of 240 digit strings\nwhich were used for testing in the experiments with the NOISEX noises.\n83\n\n\fCHAPTER 6. EXPERIMENTS\n\n84\n\nThe Aurora 2 database was used in the later set of experiments. It is based on the TIdigits\ndatabase. The TIdigits sentences have been downsampled from 20 kHz to 8kHz and various\ndistortions have been artificially added. The subset with additive noise contains speech mixed with\n8 different noise types: suburban train, babble (crowd of people), car, exhibition hall, restaurant,\nstreet, airport, train station. The noise signals were added at SNRs from 20 dB to -5 dB. They\nall contain both stationary and non-stationary components to various degrees: from car noise\nand exhibition hall which are mostly stationary, to street and airport noises which are very non–\nstationary. The first four noises are used during the multiconditional training regime (training\nwith data contaminated with noise) for inferring noisy models. All eight noises feature in the\ntesting set. The first four noises form the subset testa; the last four form the subset testb.\nThe ASR system used was a “textbook” HMM based one. Each digit (“1” to “9”, “zero”\nand “oh”) was modelled by a single “straight–through” HMM with “self” and “next” non–zero\ntransition only. The number of states was the same for all digits and varied from 8 for the\nTIdigits+NOISEX experiments to 16 for the Aurora 2 experiments. Each state had a Gaussian\nmixture p.d.f. with up to 10 Gaussians in the mixture. The grammar consisted of a silence\n(represented with a single model) followed by any number of digits followed by silence. Occasionally\na distinction was made between the “long silence” on the beginning and the end of the sentences\nand a “short”, interword silence.\nThe small vocabulary task of connected digits recognition1 was considered a convenient platform for exploration of the robustness aspects of the ASR. Arguably it is still a non–trivial task,\nwhile the grammar is minimal and there is no need for a phonetic dictionary. The aim was to\nreduce the impact of the components deemed unlikely to be the “core technology” of a robust\nASR system (phonetic dictionary, complex language model).\nThe system was trained using the HTK (Young and Woodland, 1993) in various versions (from\n1.5 to 3.0). For testing an “in–house” vectorised Matlab based decoder was used for the former,\nand the CASA toolkit (Barker, 2000) (CTK) for the later set of experiments.\n\n6.3\n\nExperiments with NOISEX factory and Lynx helicopter\nnoises\n\n6.3.1\n\nSpeech/noise separation\n\nThe separation of the speech and noise in the time–frequency plane was accomplished by deriving\na mask m(t) (as described in Section 5.3). As every point is assumed to be either speech or noise\nonly, a (non–stationary) binary mask is enough to define the separation completely. Further text\nwill assume a notation where the a mask of mi (t) = 1 signals speech, while a mask of mi (t) = 0\nsignals noise (i being the frequency band). The noise and SNR estimation were carried out in\nspectral magnitude domain, after the binning of the FFT magnitude and computing the magnitude\nof the filters, but before the compressive non–linearity in the front–end.\nSpectral Subtraction based masks (SS)\nThe spectral subtraction (SS) based masks were derived by assuming the points where the (non–\nadaptive) spectral subtraction failed and ended with negative spectral magnitude, are noise (Drygajlo and El-Maliki, 1998a). All the other points were considered speech:\n(\n1 if si (t) + ni (t) ≥ n̂i ,\nmi (t) =\n(6.1)\n0 otherwise,\nwhere si (t) + ni (t) is the noisy speech feature i at time t, and n̂ is a stationary noise estimate\n(constant over the duration of the whole utterance) computed as a mean of the first 10 frames in\nthe utterance.\n1 Morris et al. (1998) have reported on Missing Data experiments on a medium vocabulary Resource Management\ntask with artificial random masks\n\n\fCHAPTER 6. EXPERIMENTS\n\n85\n\nSignal-to-Noise Ratio based masks (SNR)\nThe noise n̂ was estimated as before, as a mean of the first 10 frames in the sentence. It was\nfurther assumed that the speech and the noise are additive in the spectral magnitude domain.\nThese assumptions make thresholding of the SNR estimate possible (which is much more accurate\nthen the SNR estimate itself). The speech mask is computed as as:\n(\nT HR\n1 if si (t) + ni (t) ≥ n̂i (1 + 10 20 ),\n(6.2)\nmi (t) =\n0 otherwise,\nwhere T HR is the threshold in [dB]. A threshold of T HR = 7dB was found to work well with a\nrange of SNRs, and the results were not too sensitive to the choice of this value.\nOracle/apriori masks (APR)\nThe oracle or apriori masks assume knowledge of the clean speech s(t). It is further assumed that\nthe speech and noise are additive in the spectral magnitude domain. With those assumptions in\nhand it is possible compute the apriori SNR estimate2 and/or to threshold it. The speech mask\nwas obtained as:\n(\n−T HR\n1 if si (t) + ni (t) < si (t)(1 + 10 20 ),\nmi (t) =\n(6.3)\n0 otherwise.\nAgain a threshold of T HR = 7dB was found to work well with a range of SNRs.\n\n6.3.2\n\nComputing the likelihood of the partially observed data\n\nComputing the likelihood of the partially observed data (see Section 5.5) p(o(t)|m(t), q(t), W ) is\nall that is needed to adapt an HMM system (trained on non–censored data) to handle the partial\ndata. The system was used both with marginalisation and imputation of the missing data. The\nfollowing techniques were tried:\nMarginalisation (MG)\nMarginalisation of the missing data:\np(o(t)|m(t), q(t), W ) = p(op (t)|q(t), W )\n\n(6.4)\n\nwhere p(op (t)|q(t), W ) is computed as in Eq. (5.19). With the diagonal GMM state p.d.f.s used\nthis amounts to disregarding the missing features.\nIt was further noted that if a noise estimate is available (e.g. with SS or SNR masks), subtracting the noise slightly improves the accuracy.\nBounded marginalisation (BMG)\nMarginalisation of the missing data while taking into account the counter–evidence constraint:\np(o(t)|m(t), q(t), W ) = p(op (t), xm (t) ∈ [0, om ]|q(t), W )\n\n(6.5)\n\n(Eq. (5.35)) where p(op (t), xm (t) ∈ [0, om ]|q(t), W ) is computed as in Eqs. (5.32) and (5.33). With\nthe diagonal GMM state p.d.f.s used for each missing feature xi (t) the area beneath the p.d.f. and\nbetween 0 and oi (t) is computed.\n2 the SNR is still estimate – although the speech s is known, it is still an assumption that the speech and noise\nare additive in the particular domain\n\n\fCHAPTER 6. EXPERIMENTS\n\n86\n\nState–based data imputation (SDI)\nImputation of the missing features by drawing a point from the conditional state p.d.f.:\np(xm (t)|op (t), q(t)) =\n\np(xm (t), op (t)|q(t))\np(op (t)|q(t))\n\n(6.6)\n\nIn all experiments with SDI the mean of the p.d.f. was computed:\nôm (t) = Exm |op (t),q(t) {xm }\n\n(6.7)\n\nas in Eq. (5.26) and all subsequent processing was on the vector (xp (t), ôm (t)) which has no data\nmissing.\nIn every time frame the possible imputations of all states are computed. Hence there are as\nmany versions of the frame as there are states. During the emission probability calculation, for\neach state only the likelihood of the feature vector with xm ’s filled from the p.d.f. of the same\nstate is computed i.e. p(op (t), ôm (t)|q(t)).\nBounded state–based data imputation (BSDI)\nImputation of the missing features by drawing a point from the conditional state p.d.f. constrained\nin the range of [0, o(t)] (see Section 5.5.7). Firstly the conditional state p.d.f. was computed as:\np(xm |op (t), xm ∈ [0, om (t)], q(t)) =\n\np(xm , op (t)|q(t))\np(op (t), xm ∈ [0, om (t)]|q(t))\n\n(6.8)\n\nas in Eq. (5.36).\nSecondly, a point from the conditional p.d.f. was chosen as ôm (t). It was noted that in\nmost cases the Gaussians in the mixture were far away in at least one dimension, resulting in\na multimodal conditional p.d.f. For each Gaussian in the mixture, the point with the highest\ndensity that is within the bounds [0, om (t)] was chosen as a possible candidate for ôm (t). Then\namong all points the one with the highest overall posterior probability (i.e. taking into account\nthe “responsibilities” together with the likelihood) was chosen as value for ôm (t). All subsequent\nprocessing was on the “completed” vector (xp (t), ôm (t)).\n\n6.3.3\n\nResults with 64 channel ratemap features\n\nThe acoustic vectors consisted of smooth outputs of from 64–channel auditory filter bank (centre\nfrequencies spaced linearly in ERB scale from 50 to 8000Hz), computed every 10ms (Cooke, 1991).\nHTK (Young and Woodland, 1993) was used for training, and a local MATLAB decoder for\nrecognition. Twelve models (’1’–’9’, ’oh’, ’zero’ and ’silence’) consisting of 8 no–skip, straight–\nthrough states with observations modelled with a 10 component diagonal Gaussian mixture were\ntrained on clean speech. Stationary Lynx helicopter noise as well as non–stationary factory noise\nfrom the NOISEX database was added (with random start points) at SNRs from +20dB to -5dB\nto a subset of the TIdigits test set consisting of 240 digit strings used for testing. In all graphs,\nthe X-axis is the SNR, decreasing from clean, 20 dB, to -5 dB in 5 dB steps, while the Y-axis\ndepicts the recognition accuracy. In all cases the factory noise proved to be a harder task due to\nits non–stationarity.\nMasks based on spectral subtraction\nThe purpose of the experiment was to check whether treating the points where SS failed as missing\nwould produce any improvements over SS alone.\nFigures 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 depict the results on factory noise. Figures 6.4, 6.5 and 6.6 depict the\nresults on Lynx helicopter noise.\n\n\fCHAPTER 6.

EXPERIMENTS\n\n89\n\nIn all cases a discrete non–stationary SS mask was derived. The baseline and the SS curve are\nthe accuracy of the recogniser without any compensation and with spectral subtraction respectively. The noise estimate for SS was the same one as for deriving the SS mask.\nFigures 6.1 and 6.4 show the results of the marginalisation (MG) and the bounded marginalisation (BMG) technique. Figures 6.2 and 6.5 show the results of state based data imputation (SDI)\nand bounded SDI (BSDI). In all cases treating the points where SS failed as missing improves the\nresults. Further, using the bounds constraint gives slight, but consistent advantage.\nFigures 6.3 and 6.6 compare the improvements between the bounded marginalisation and state\nbased data imputation. For factory noise they are mostly the same, with BSDI performing only\nslightly better at 10 dB. For Lynx helicopter noise, it seams BSDI outperforms BMG at all SNRs.\nMasks based on local SNR estimation\nFigures 6.7, 6.8 and 6.9 depict the results on factory noise. Figures 6.10, 6.11 and 6.12 depict the\nresults on Lynx helicopter noise.\nIn all cases a discrete non–stationary SNR mask was derived with a 7 dB threshold. The\nbaseline and the SS curve are the accuracy of the recogniser without any compensation and with\nspectral subtraction respectively. The noise estimate for SS was the same one as for deriving the\nSNR mask.\nFigures 6.7 and 6.10 show the results of the marginalisation (MG) and the bounded marginalisation (BMG) technique. Figures 6.8 and 6.11 show the results of state based data imputation\n(SDI) and bounded SDI (BSDI). In both cases when no bounds are used (MG and SDI) the accuracy suffers at mid to high SNRs and both perform worse then SS. They do perform better then\nSS at low SNRs. It was noted that in both cases a major source of errors are random insertions\nin frames where there is little or no data at all (all features in the frame are noisy). Introducing\nthe bounds both with marginalisation (BMG) and state based data imputation (BSDI) rectifies\nthis, as bounds make the silence model win in the quiet frames where the speech was swamped\nby noise. The accuracy is improved, and both BMG and BSDI outperform SS significantly at all\nSNRs.\nFigures 6.9 and 6.12 compare the improvements between the bounded marginalisation and\nstate based data imputation. Both for factory noise and Lynx helicopter noise, BMG seems to\noutperform BSDI at all SNRs. It seems that the SNR masks, which let less but more reliable data\nin (compared to the SS masks) suit marginalisation better, while SS masks (letting more, but less\nreliable data) suit data imputation better (see Figure 5.2 for masks example).\nApriori masks\nThe apriori masks are derived from the clean and noisy speech (as described on pp. 85). They\nare indicative of the performance that may be achieved with very good separation. They are also\nuseful in assessing the performance of different methods for computing the likelihood of the partial\ndata independently of the separation front–end.\nFigures 6.13, 6.14 and 6.15 depict the results on factory noise. Figures 6.16, 6.17 and 6.18\ndepict the results on Lynx helicopter noise.\nIn all cases a discrete non–stationary APR mask was derived, with an estimated SNR threshold of 18 dB. The baseline and the SS curve are the accuracy of the recogniser without any\ncompensation and with spectral subtraction respectively, and are plotted as indication only.\nFigures 6.13 and 6.16 show the results of the marginalisation (MG) and the bounded marginalisation (BMG) technique. Figures 6.14 and 6.17 show the results of state based data imputation\n(SDI) and bounded SDI (BSDI). The trends are mostly similar to the ones observed with SNR\nmask (previous section). In both cases when no bounds are used (MG and SDI) the accuracy\nsuffers at mid to high SNRs. The drop is most dramatic with MG – accuracy decreasing sharply\nwhen going from clean speech to 20dB, then staying mostly flat down to low SNRs. As noted\nbefore, a major source of errors are random insertions in the frames where there is little or no data\nat all. This is even more pronounced with APR masks (compared to SNR masks).

EXPERIMENTS\n\n94\n\nthe bounds both with marginalisation (BMG) and state based data imputation (BSDI) rectifies\nthis, as bounds make the silence model win in the quiet frames where the speech was swamped by\nnoise. The accuracy improves at all SNRs and with both noises.\nFigures 6.15 and 6.18 compare the improvements between the bounded marginalisation and\nstate based data imputation. Both for factory noise and Lynx helicopter noise, BMG seems to\noutperform BSDI at all SNRs. As discussed in Section 5.5.6, imputation seems a harder task then\nmarginalisation, as speech reconstruction is attempted, in addition to computing the likelihood of\nthe partial data.\nApriori mask threshold\nThe apriori masks are derived from the clean and noisy speech, and are indicative of the performance that may be achieved with very good separation. Figures 6.19, 6.20, 6.21 and 6.22 show\nthe sensitivity to the choice of a threshold value for ratemap features.\nFigures 6.19 and 6.20 depict the results on factory noise. Figures 6.21 and 6.22 depict the\nresults on Lynx helicopter noise.\nIn all cases a discrete non–stationary APR mask was derived by comparing the clean and the\nnoisy speech. APR18 stands for SNR threshold of 18.27 dB (clean and noisy speech differ 1 dB\nor less). APR8 stands for SNR threshold of 7.69 dB (clean and noisy speech differ 3dB or less).\nAPR0 stands for SNR threshold of 0.04dB (clean and noisy speech differ 6dB or less).\nFigures 6.19 and 6.21 show that both with factory and Lynx noise, MG is slightly better off\nwith a higher threshold of 18.27 dB then a lower one of 7.69 dB. The opposite, but to a greater\ndegree, is true for BMG: BMG is better off with a lower threshold of 7.69 dB then a larger one\nof 18.27 dB, and the difference is more pronounced. This may be due to the imposition of the\nadditional constraint – the bounds. Lacking this constraint, MG is more sensitive to noisy data\ngetting through the mask. Whereas BMG is able to cope with more data, even it is of lesser\nquality.\nResults for data imputation on Figures 6.20 and (6.22) are more consistent. Letting more\ndata in (APR8 v.s. APR18) helps accuracy both with SDI and BSDI. Using bounds always\nimproves accuracy at the same threshold. Data imputation, compared to marginalisation, seems\nmore sensitive to lack of data then it is to its noisiness – using an even lower threshold of 0.04 dB\n(APR0 on Figure 6.20) increases the accuracy further.\nHowever, the improvement seems to depend on the mask quality. Using similar thresholds with\nSNR (“real”) masks does not lead to improved results there.\n\n6.3.4\n\nResults with 24 channel filterbank features\n\nThe experimental setup was similar as in the previous Section 6.3.3. The only difference was that\nthe acoustic vectors consisted of 24 channel Mel-spaced triangular filterbank outputs (Young and\nWoodland, 1993) computed every 10ms.\nMasks based on local SNR estimation\nFigures 6.23, 6.24 and 6.25 depict the results on factory noise. Figures 6.26, 6.27 and 6.28 depict\nthe results on Lynx helicopter noise.\nIn all cases a discrete non–stationary SNR mask was derived with a 7 dB threshold. The\nbaseline and the SS curve are the accuracy of the recogniser without any compensation and with\nspectral subtraction respectively. The noise estimate for SS was the same one as for deriving the\nSNR mask.\nAll results largely mirror what has already been observed with SNR masks with 64–channel\nratemap features.\nFigures 6.23 and 6.26 show the results of the marginalisation (MG) and the bounded marginalisation (BMG) technique. Figures 6.24 and 6.27 show the results of state based data imputation\n\n\fCHAPTER 6.

The do perform better then\nSS at low SNRs. As previously noted, this is mostly due to random insertions in the frames where\nthere is little or no data. Introducing the bounds both with marginalisation (BMG) and state\nbased data imputation (BSDI) rectifies this, as bounds make the silence model win in the quiet\nframes where the speech was swamped by noise. The accuracy is improved, and both BMG and\nBSDI outperform SS significantly at all SNRs.\nFigures 6.25 and 6.28 compare the improvements between the bounded marginalisation and\nstate based data imputation. Both for factory noise and Lynx helicopter noise, BMG seems to\noutperform BSDI at all SNRs.\nApriori masks\nAs previously noted, the apriori masks are derived from the clean and noisy speech. They are\nindicative of the performance that may be achieved with very good separation. They are also useful\nin assessing the performance of different methods for computing the likelihood of the partial data\nindependently of the separation front–end. The baseline and the SS curve are the accuracy of the\nrecogniser without any compensation and with spectral subtraction respectively, and are plotted\nas indication only.\nFigures 6.29, 6.30 and 6.31 depict the results on factory noise. Figures 6.32, 6.33 and 6.34\ndepict the results on Lynx helicopter noise.\nComparing the results with the APR masks on 64–channel ratemap features, it is notable that\nthe threshold of 18.27 dB is not used anymore. With only 24 features (instead of 64), there isn’t\nenough data left for ASR with such a stringent criterion for data quality. Thresholds of 7.69 dB\n(APR8) and 0.04 dB (APR0) were compared in various conditions and using the different MD\ntechniques.\nFigures 6.29 and 6.32 show the results of the marginalisation (MG) and the bounded marginalisation (BMG) technique. With both noises, the performance of the both techniques is better with\nthe more stringent criterion. It seems that for marginalisation it’s better to let less, but more\nreliable data in. Figures 6.30 and 6.33 show the results of state based data imputation (SDI) and\nbounded SDI (BSDI). Here, the opposite (compared to MG and BMG) seems to hold: letting\nmore, but less reliable data in helps improving the accuracy (with the exception of SDI on Lynx\nnoise).\nFigures 6.31 and 6.34 compare the four techniques (MG, BMG, SDI, BSDI) at their best SNR\nthreshold. As expected, using the bounds constraint improves the accuracy significantly. Also,\nBMG seems to consistently outperform BSDI, while MG is worse than SDI at higher SNRs and\nbetter at lower ones.\nThe trends in the results are mostly in line with the previously observed results on 64–channel\nratemap features, with the notable exception of using a lower threshold (in general) with 24–\nchannel filterbank features.\nUsing “cleaned” (clean) models\nFigure 6.35 depicts the results on factory, and Figure 6.36 on Lynx helicopter noise, with models\ntrained on clean speech that has been processed with SS. The stationary noise estimate was\nobtained as the mean of the first 10 frames of each sentence, and was subsequently subtracted.\nAlthough clean speech was used for training, the benefit of the process is that the models “learn”\nsome of the artifacts introduced by the “cleaning process” (that is going to be used during testing\nlatter) during training. These models are referred to as “cleaned models”, whereas the models\nobtained by training on unprocessed clean speech are “clean models”.\nOn both noises, SS with “cleaned models” (SScl) was compared with SS (with “clean models”),\nand so was bounded marginalisation (BMGcl) with SNR mask. In both noises SScl performs better\nthen SS at all but the lowest SNRs. BMGcl outperforms BMG by a smaller margin, but from\na higher baseline. It seems that this commonly used technique for improving the performance\n\n\fCHAPTER 6.

Along the Y–axis is the log–likelihood,\nwhile the SNR decreasing from clean speech, to 20 dB, to -5 dB in 5 dB steps is on the X–axis.\nBounded marginalisation on the noisy data (BMGn), with no noise estimate subtracted from the\nnoisy speech, was used. The contributions of the missing features to the likelihood were divided by\nthe range om (t) − 0 = om (t), to yield the “average likelihood” (see Section 5.5.7 and Figure 5.4).\nAPR and SNR masks are computed as before. The Maximum Likelihood Mask (MLM) is\ncomputed by comparing the contribution to the likelihood (of the the vector) by each feature:\nhow much does a feature contribute when it is present, and how much when it is missing.

After the recognition has finished, the best path is backtracked and\nfinally determines the MLM mask used. In a sense, the MLM mask maximises the local acoustic\nevidence for each individual state.\nThe difference in accuracy between the APR and SNR masks carries over in the log–likelihood\ndomain: the average log–likelihood of the best path with APR mask is considerably greater then\nwith SNR mask at all SNRs. This raises the possibility of using the acoustic likelihoods as guides\nduring mask creation (speech/noise separation). The average log–likelihood of the best path with\nMLM mask is indeed much larger then with SNR mask. But it is also larger then when APR\nmasks are used. And the accuracy of the best path with MLM mask is much worse then with SNR\n(and APR) masks (not shown). Investigation of the MLM masks showed that although giving rise\nto best paths with high likelihoods, the masks themselves were very unlikely. The present and\nmissing features in the mask were finely dispersed over the whole T–F plane, without any of the\ngrouping apparent in the APR masks.\nUsing MLM mask effectively locally maximises the partial likelihood P (O|M, Q∗ , W ) from\nEq. (5.2), without taking into account the likelihood of the mask itself P (M |Q∗ , W ) when computing the “best path”3 W ∗ . If a suitable mask model P (M |Q∗ , W ) penalised the very unlikely\nMLM mask, the accuracy of the best path with MLM would probably correlate to its log–likelihood,\nas is the case with SNR and APR masks.\nIterative mask refinement\nStarting with a SNR mask, the mask was iteratively refined by cycling through recognition (alignment) and (most likely) mask reestimation. In each iteration the state alignment of the best\npath was obtained. Having one state corresponding to each frame, the p.d.f. of that particular\nstate was used to infer the most likely mask for that frame alone. As in the previous section, the\nfeature was considered to be present if its likelihood was greater then its “average likelihood” (see\nSection 5.5.7). Otherwise, it was considered missing. Once a new mask was obtained, the best\npath with that mask was computed. This path was used in the next iteration, etc. The iterative\nprocess was aborted if the likelihood of the best path did not increase sufficiently.\nFigure 6.38 depicts the accuracy with this method (SNRit) used together with bounded\n3 the equation refers to isolated word recognition, but it generalises to the connected word recognition task (like\nthe experiment above)\n\n\fCHAPTER 6. EXPERIMENTS\n\n103\n\nderivatives\n\nfeatures\ntime/frames\n\nFigure 6.39: Computing the “strict” mask for the derivatives\nmarginalisation on noisy data (BMGn). The accuracy is compared to the one of using the initial\nSNR mask alone (SNR+BMGn). There is some improvement at mid SNRs, but it is questionable if it is enough to justify manifold increase in computational cost (compared to improvements\nachievable with other means).\n\n6.3.5\n\nResults with 24 channel filterbank features with their first derivatives\n\nIn this set of experiments, the 24–channel filterbank features were supplemented by their temporal\nderivatives approximations, yielding 48 feature vectors. The temporal derivatives were approximated with the “standard” expression (Furui, 1986):\nPN\nj=−N j · xi (t + j)\n∆xi (t) =\n(6.9)\nPN\n2\nj=−N j\nwith N = 2.\nThe problem with MD ASR is that some of the xi (t + j) for j = −N . . . N features may be\nmissing. One solution is to treat the derivative ∆xi (t) as missing if any of the features xi (t + j),\nj = −N . . . N needed to compute ∆xi (t) are missing (the strict mask), as depicted in Figure 6.39.\nIf the missing mask pattern was random, this would create a very sparse mask for the derivatives.\nHowever, in the experiments with speech and noise this is not the case. The reliable features tend\nto be clustered into T–F blocks, so the sparsity of the derivative mask is not much greater than\nthat of the features mask.\nIt was also noted that when strict masks were used with bounded marginalisation and data\nimputation, the bounds on the derivatives were so wide that they made little difference (at a great\ncomputational cost). Hence in all experiments (unless noted otherwise) the contribution of the\nmissing derivatives to the likelihood were disregarded, effectively turning BMG into MG and BSDI\ninto SDI as far as the derivatives were concerned.\nStrict SNR and APR masks\nFigures 6.40 and 6.41 depict the results with strict SNR masks (SNRst) on factory and Lynx noise\nrespectively. Figures 6.42 and 6.43 depict the results with strict APR masks (APRst) on factory\nand Lynx noise respectively.\nAll figures contain results with spectral subtraction (SS) and Mel–cepstral features (MFCC),\nwithout or with Cepstral Mean Normalisation (MFCC+CMN) as well. For the latter 13 cepstral\nfeatures were extracted from the 24 filterbank outputs via Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) (Young\nand Woodland, 1993). For MFCC+CMN, the mean (on a per–sentence basis) of each feature was\nsubtracted from it. Then, their first and second derivatives were appended to the feature vector\nyielding 39 features for each vector.\nMD techniques tested were bounded marginalisation (BMG) and bounded state based imputation on noisy data (BSDIn). It was found that with first derivatives, the data imputation technique\nis very sensitive to the disturbances introduced to the derivatives due to the subtraction of the\nnoise estimate. Hence the noisy data was used for imputation.\n\n\fCHAPTER 6.

The only exception is\nBSDI performing worse then SS and MFCC at high SNRs (clean and 20 dB) on factory noise.\nAgain, BMG performs better then BSDI at all SNRs and on both noises.\nTherefore, with APRst masks (Figures 6.42 and 6.43) only the results with bounded marginalisation are shown. The apriori masks are not “true” masks, as they are derived by knowing the\nclean (in addition to the noisy) speech. However, they are indicative of what can be achieved with\nvery good speech/noise separation. The results are very tempting: accuracy of around 90% (a bit\nmore for Lynx, a but less for factory noise) at -5 dB. It seems that these results point firmly to poor\nmask quality of SNRst masks as the major reason for poor performance (compared to the usage\nof APRst masks). They also may indicate that major improvements are unlikely to come from\nusing some new technique for estimation of the partial likelihood. Rather, major improvements\nmaybe expected with better masks estimation.\n“Common” ASR system tuning techniques\nFigures 6.44 and 6.45 show the effects on using some common ASR tuning techniques on the\nrecognition accuracy on factory and Lynx helicopter noise.\nThe baseline MD ASR system (BMG) was tested with strict SNR (SNRst) and apriori (APRst)\nmasks. The improved system (BMG++) consisted of the following:\n• tuned word insertion penalty\n• additional, short interword silence\n• rudimentary language modelling – it was noted that no sentence contained both the “zero”\nand “oh” models, hence transcriptions mixing both in the same sentence were rejected during\ntesting\nFigure 6.44 shows that on factory noise there is small but notable improvement, which is more\npronounced with SNRst mask then with APRst mask. On Lynx helicopter noise (Figure 6.45),\nthe results with SNRst mask are mixed, and the improvement with APRst mask is smaller.\n\n\fCHAPTER 6.

In both cases the\n“improved system” from the previous section is the baseline.\nThe bounds on the missing derivatives were computed by knowing the bounds on the missing\n“static” features (used to compute the derivative) and the way the “static” features are used to\ncompute the derivative (Eq. (6.9)).\nThe results for both noises are consistent. If the mask is accurate (e.g. APRst mask), then\nbounding the derivatives does help at lower SNRs (only slightly, but the baseline is already quite\nhigh). Whereas when the mask is not accurate (e.g. SNRst mask), the benefit of using bounds\nis wiped out by them being not accurate in significant number of cases. Therefore, there is little\nincentive in using the bounds on he derivatives when the bounds are unreliable.\n“Standard” techniques for improving ASR system’s robustness\nAs an indication of what is possible with some “standard” robustness technique, Figures 6.48\nand 6.49 depict the accuracy with Mel cepstral features (MFCC) with and without Cepstral\nmean normalisation (subtraction) (CMN) on factory and Lynx helicopter noise respectively. The\nresults with spectral subtraction on 24–channel filterbanks with their first derivatives are also\nshown. These two techniques were chosen as they are the most representative of the currently\nused techniques for improving the robustness of an ASR system.\nThe system was exactly the same, and trained and tested on exactly the same data as the one\nusing the MD techniques.\nIt seems that MFCC features are inherently more robust and they outperform SS both with\nand without CMN on both noises.\n\n6.4\n\nExperiments on the Aurora 2 database\n\nAs described in Section 6.2, the Aurora 2 database (Hirsch and Pearce, 2000) is a noisy and\ndownsampled version of the TIdigits database (Leonard, 1984).\nFor this set of experiments, 32–channel ratemaps (Cooke, 1991) were used as features in the\nMD ASR system.

Their first order derivatives (Eq. (6.9)) were appended to\nthe ratemaps to form a 64–element feature vector. An appropriate strict mask was used for the\nderivatives.\nPreviously used methods for mask estimation assumed a mask with probability of unity, i.e. no\nattempt was made to estimate the factor P (M |Q∗ , W ) from Eq. (5.2) when estimating the mask.\nThe probability of all possible masks other then the estimated one was set to 0. Hence the sum\nFor the experiments on Aurora 2, two methods that associate certain probability with each mask\nwere tested. The following two sections will outline the techniques employed.\n\n6.4.1\n\nSoft/fuzzy SNR mask (SNRSoft)\n\nWith the soft (fuzzy) SNR masks, the probability of each point being speech was expressed by\nsuitable mapping of the estimated SNR. Hence the term soft/fuzzy – instead of thresholding the\nSNR (as with the SNR masks), each point in the mask gets an associated probability. The mapping\nwas accomplished via a sigmoid function:\nP (mi (t) = 1) =\n\n1\n1 + e−α(SNˆ Ri (t)−β)\n\n(6.10)\n\nˆ R was computed as for the SNR masks. The centre β and the slope α\nThe local SNR estimate SN\nof the sigmoid were chosen empirically to achieve best result on the Aurora 2 testa, noise1 subset\n(Subway noise). The same parameters were used across both test subsets (testa and testb) and\nacross all noises.\n\n\fCHAPTER 6. EXPERIMENTS\n\n6.4.2\n\n108\n\nAdaptive noise tracking (SNRA)\n\nThe adaptive noise tracking scheme consists of tracking both the noise mean and variance. It is\nassumed that the distribution of the noise is Normal, and that the noise features are independent.\nThe first 10 frames of each utterance were used for initial estimates of the noise mean and variance.\nThen, each feature oi (t) in the incoming frame o(t) was scored on how likely is that it was generated\nfrom the noise distribution estimated in that channel so far. This was accomplished by thresholding\nthe probability of an SNR being less then a SNR threshold. In the experiments reported in the next\nˆ Ri (t) < −7dB) > 0.6 the feature oi (t) was considered to have been generated by\nsection, if P (SN\nthe noise source. Therefore it was used to recursively adapt the noise mean and variance estimates.\nˆ Ri (t) < X) with threshold X in dB was computed as\nThe P (SN\n!\nÃ oi (t)\n− µi (t)\n1+10X/20\nˆ\np\nP (SN Ri (t) < X) = 0.5 − 0.5 · erf\n(6.11)\n2Σi (t)\nfor the spectral data. The recursive update of the mean µi (t) and the variance Σi (t) (independently\nfor each feature/channel) was:\nµi (t + 1) =\nsi (t + 1) =\nΣi (t + 1) =\n\nαµi (t) + (1 − α)oi\nαsi (t) + (1 − α)o2i\nsi (t + 1) − µi (t + 1)\n\n(6.12)\n\nwith α = 0.995.\nOnce a noise estimate was obtained, an SNR estimate was obtained by assuming that the\nspeech and the noise are additive in the spectral magnitude domain (resulting in the noisy speech\nmagnitude) at all times.\nThe probability of belonging to the speech/noise source was subsequently computed from the\nlocal SNR. For clean models the SNR threshold was fixed at 7 dB, i.e. the probability of each\npoint in the T–F plane being speech was computed as:\nˆ Ri (t) > 7dB)\nP (mi (t) = 1) = P (SN\n\n(6.13)\n\nThis results in a mask that has very few, but reliable points. For noisy models it was found that\nit is preferable to use a lower threshold of 0 dB instead of 7 dB. This less stringent assessment of\nthe speech quality results in more points considered more likely to be speech.\nThis probability can be used in the “soft” MD computation instead of the sigmoid from the\nprevious subsection. The advantage of SNRA seems to be that while the centre β and the slope\nα of the sigmoid (mapping the SNR estimate into a reliability estimate) are somewhat noise\ndependent, we haven’t observed the same with the threshold X and the “forgetting factor” α of\nˆ Ri (t) < X)\nSNRA. The disadvantage is the computational cost. Assuming that computing P (SN\nis comparable to sigmoid evaluation, the computational cost of SNRA is at least twice the one of\nthe sigmoid mapping.\nˆ Ri (t) > XdB) is simply\nIf a discrete mask is needed, the probability P (mi (t) = 1) = P (SN\nthresholded to provide binary speech/noise discrimination.\n\n6.4.3\n\nComputing the state likelihood with fuzzy masks\n\nSince each point in the mask is treated being independent of the rest, and the state p.d.f.s are\nsums of factorisable p.d.f.s, Eq. (5.8) can be used to efficiently calculate the sum over all possible\nmasks in Eq. (5.2):\nX\nY\nP (o(t)|q(t), W ) =\nP (k) [pi (oi (t)|k, mi (t) = 0, q ∗ (t), W )p(mi (t) = 0|q ∗ (t), W )\n(6.14)\ni\nk\n+ pi (oi (t)|k, mi (t) = 1, q ∗ (t), W )p(mi (t) = 0|q ∗ (t), W )]\nThe contribution of the present and missing features to the likelihood is weighted by the probability\nof them being present or missing, which is provided by the fuzzy mask.\n\n\fCHAPTER 6.

It is set by the rules of the Aurora 2 competition. Similarly,\nthe “multi baseline” results are the baseline results with MFCC features and models trained on\nthe noisy portion of the database.\nThe bounded marginalisation (BMG) was tested with strict discrete SNR masks (SNRst) as\nwell as with strict fuzzy SNR masks (SNRstSoft). In both cases it outperforms the “clean baseline”\nin all conditions. Estimating the mask probability, even crudely as with SNRstSoft, considerably\nimproves the BMG results. In all cases the “multiconditional baseline” (models trained on noisy\nspeech) performs best.\nFigure 6.50 contains an additional result with discrete apriori mask (APRst). It is interesting\nto compare that to the “multi baseline” result, as:\n• using data contaminated with noise for training is often considered the upper limit on what\ncan be achieved with various noise robustness techniques (e.g. various models adaptation\ntechniques)\n• using apriori masks can be indicative of the upper limit of what can be achieved with the\nMD approach to robust ASR\nBoth methods provide comparable performance at high SNRs. But for mid and low SNRs, the\n“multiconditional training” rapidly deteriorates, while BMG with APRst masks steadily holds\nonto the performance.\n\n6.4.5\n\nResults with adaptive noise tracking\n\nFigures 6.58, 6.59, 6.60 and 6.61 depict the results on the four noises from Aurora 2 testa test set.\nFigures 6.62, 6.63, 6.64 and 6.65 depict the results on the four noises from Aurora 2 testb test set.\nAs before, the “clean baseline” results are the baseline results with MFCC features and models\ntrained on the clean portion of the database, and fixed the rules of the Aurora 2 competition.\nSimilarly, the “multi baseline” results are the baseline results with MFCC features and models\ntrained on the noisy portion of the database.\nThe models used for the experiments were trained on the noisy portion of the Aurora 2\ndatabase. The adaptive noise estimation had a threshold of 0 dB for assessing the probability\nof the mask.\nBounded marginalisation (BMG) was tested with strict fuzzy SNRA masks (SNRAstSoft)\nand strict discrete APR masks (APRst). Using SNRAstSoft masks and noisy models makes the\nMD results comparable with the multiconditional baseline. Bounded marginalisation in this case\nperforms the same with the multiconditional baseline at high SNRs, slightly better for some noises\nand worse for others on mid SNRs, and always significantly better at low SNRs.\nThe clean baseline and marginalisation with apriori masks are also plotted for indication.\nBounded marginalisation with apriori masks (APRst) performs surprisingly well even at the lowest\nSNR, where very few reliable speech points are available.\nThe main advantage of the fuzzy SNRA masks over discrete SNR masks seems to be the\nfuzziness, rather then the adaptation. SNRA masks, when used as discrete masks (by thresholding\nthe probability estimate) behave only marginally better then discrete SNR masks.\n\n6.4.6\n\nToken dependent noise estimation\n\nFigure 6.66 depicts the results with “token dependent noise estimate” (TDNE) on the Aurora\n2 testa noise1 subset (Subway noise). 24–Channel filterbank features together with their first\nderivatives were used.\n\n\fCHAPTER 6.

Briefly, the scheme assumes an imagined “token”\nexists in every state of the speech models. Each token carries its path and the likelihood of the\ndata it has “seen” so far. Every time frame, the token from every state is propagated into all\nadmissible subsequent states and has its path and likelihood score updated. Next, for every state,\nonly the token with the highest score is kept while the rest are discarded. The process is repeated\nuntil there is data available. Tokens in the “last” states of every model are compared, and the\nmost likely among them is the winner.\nIn TDNE, each token carries a noise estimate in addition to the other data (path, likelihood\nscore). Tokens propagated through silence model(s) have their noise estimates updated. When\ncomputing the frame likelihood, each token, having separate noise estimate, gets different mask\n(and maybe speech) estimate. The scheme was employed with the standard bounded marginalisation technique. For the dynamic features the static mask was used as well, as computing the\nstrict mask as before requires knowledge not only of the static masks in the past frames, but the\nfuture frames as well, which are not available.4\nAs shown on Figure 6.66, using SNRst mask derived with TDNE does improve the accuracy\nover the standard SNR mask (which uses stationary noise estimate) at all but the highest and the\nlowest SNRs.\n\n6.5\n\nSummary of the experimental results\n\nTwo series of experiments were carried out on two noisy versions of the same data (TIdigits). The\nMD techniques were used in conjunction with masks provided by separation that relies on noise\nestimation. The MD techniques themselves do not call for noise estimation. However, at the time\nthe experiments were done, no functioning CASA system was available for masks creation.\nIn the first series, the data was contaminated with two noises: factory (non–stationary) and\nLynx helicopter (stationary). The main conclusions are:\n• Both BMG and BSDI perform better then SS with the same noise estimate.\n• MG and SDI both suffer from random insertions when there is little data present in a frame.\nSDI is more suspect to this problem, as it has to recover the missing data from the present\n4 this can be overcome by shifting the derivatives N frames back, i.e.\n\nN )/\n\nPN\n\nj=−N j\n\n2 instead of Eq.

Using bounds (BMG and BSDI) solves that problem.\n• Marginalisation (MG and BMG) is more accurate then imputation (SDI and BSDI). The\ndata can be imputed after it is Viterbi aligned with the models using BMG.\n• Using cleaned models gives only slight improvement (both for MD and SS).\n• Using standard deltas with strict mask provides improvement; the missing deltas need not\nbe bounded, but simply marginalised.\n• Using soft masks brings big improvement.\nIn the second series of experiments, the Aurora 2 noisy database was used. Several points can\nbe made regarding the Aurora 2 graphs:\n• MD with noisy models and adaptive noise tracking performs as good as or better then the\nbaseline with the noisy models - same or slightly worse at high SNRs and better at low\nSNRs. It should be noted that the filterbank models used in MD have baseline worse then\nthe Aurora 2 MFCC baseline. So the adaptive noise estimation with MD recovers some of\nthat loss.\n• MD with clean models and with stationary noise estimate performs significantly better then\nthe clean MFCCs based baseline. This is expected as the baseline doesn’t take into account\nthe noise at all, neither during training nor during testing.\n• MD with apriori masks shows the potential of the technique with an extremely good/perfect\nmask. The results are surprisingly good even at low SNRs and the accuracy doesn’t plunge\ncatastrophically.\n• The apriori masks results clearly point that the deficiencies in the MD approach at present\nare not of poor speech modelling, but of poor identification of the speech components in the\nnoisy speech. Therefore the huge performance gap between the realistic mask estimates and\nthe apriori mask at low SNRs can be addressed by improving the identification of the speech\nin noise and therefore the mask.5\n• Adaptive noise estimation and similar techniques for noise tracking are somewhat more\neffective then stationary noise estimation. However, not only do they introduce more complex\nprocessing (their computational cost is negligible compared to the rest of the system), but\nalso rely on tunable parameters which need to be optimised by trial and error.\n\n6.6\n\nSummary\n\nResults of the recognition experiments using an MD HMM system were presented in this chapter.\nA “standard”/textbook HMM system, adapted suitably to handle the MD, was employed on a\nconnected digits task. The speech was artificially contaminated with noise at SNRs from -5 dB to\n20 dB. Clean speech was also used for testing. MD ASR was tried with different features (although\nall constrained to be frequency domain features) and with and without their first derivatives. For\nmask estimation, couple of techniques based on local SNR estimation were employed. They rely\non noise estimation. We mostly made use of simplest forms of noise estimation, and with purpose.\nMD techniques don’t need noise estimation if there is another process (see Chapter 4) that can\nproduce the mask. However, in absence of widely available, computationally cheap and easily\nreproducible methods for speech/noise identification (separation) we had to make use of noise\n5 This is consistent with the results with and without voice activity detection, and in general with the approaches\ntaken in most of the noise reduction algorithms. These algorithms are knowledge driven and rely on the gross speech\nfeatures (harmonics, continuity, simultaneous transitions, onsets and offsets across frequency bands) which have\nalready been singled out in the (C)ASA community as features significant for speech separation (or identification\nof the speech portions in a noise mixture).\n\n\fCHAPTER 6. EXPERIMENTS\n\n116\n\nestimation in order to do the experiments. Further, we saw how adding even a crude probabilistic\ntreatment to the mask brings improvements over a simple assumption that the particular mask\nused is the only possible one. Both marginalisation and data imputation were tested as methods\nfor computing the likelihood of the partial data vectors. Toward the end (i.e. for the experiments\non the Aurora 2 database) only marginalisation was used as it was always computationally cheaper\nand usually more accurate then data imputation. The results on the Aurora 2 database are directly\ncomparable to other published results on the same, standardised database of noisy data. We think\nthat even with the simple mask estimation techniques employed here, the MD ASR system does\nperform competitively. Further, the results with apriori masks point that improving the separation\npart in the MD chain is bound to bring most benefit to improving the accuracy.\n\n\fChapter 7\n\nDiscussion\n7.1\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn this chapter the relation of MD techniques with other approaches to robust ASR which touch\neither or both the separation and the recognition parts of a robust system will be discussed\nfirst. Some Frequently Asked Questions about MD techniques will be answered next. Several\npossibilities open for further research, the unresolved problems and unknowns will also get a\nmention. The chapter (and the thesis) closes with the main conclusions that we have drawn from\nthis work.\n\n7.2\n\nRelation to other approaches to robust ASR\n\nThe missing data techniques discussed throughout this text are related to different extents to\nseveral known techniques. Some take the ”missing data” idea further (e.g. multisource decoding),\nothers have arrived at the same techniques spurred by different motivation (e.g. masking), and still\nothers have utilised all-or-nothing separation motivated by nothing more then sound signal processing principles (e.g. MAX approximation of the compressive nonlinearity) and were attracted\nby the simplicity that makes the computations trackable (HMM decomposition).\n\n7.2.1\n\nMultisource decoder by Barker, Cooke, and Ellis (2000, 2001a)\n\nThe multisource decoder (Barker et al., 2000, 2001a) takes MD techniques a step further, insofar\nthat it relaxes the requirements on the separation frontend. Not only does it allow for arbitrary\ngroupings of features in the time frequency (T–F) plane, but it doesn’t need to label which ones are\nspeech, and which ones are noise. It allows for the both possibilities, forking two decoders when\nit encounters a start of a new patch (a group of T–F points coming from the same source). Both\ndecoders continue to decode in parallel the same patch of data. One of the forked decoders assumes\nthat the patch belonged to the noise source and decodes using the BMG technique (Section 6.3.2).\nThe other decoder assumes that the patch was generated by the speech source. All points that\ndo not belong to that patch are treated the same by both decoders. At the end of the patch, the\ndecoders are merged. For each state of every model the higher of the two scores (resulting from\nthe data assumed to be speech and noise) is kept. If during the decoding of the patch the start of\na new patch is encountered, each of the decoders forks two new ones, etc.\nThis amounts to a simultaneous search both for the ML path Q∗ and the ML mask M ∗\n(from Chapter 5). In (Barker et al., 2000) the mask is initially based on local SNR estimate\n(Section 6.3.1). Then it is subsequently broken in coherent fragments – patches – such that:\n• the neighbouring present points belong to the same patch\n• the patches are broken at the edges of the four arbitrarily chosen frequency bands\n117\n\n\fCHAPTER 7.

The figure was kindly supplied by Jon Barker.\nThis a precursor to “schema driven grouping”. Barker et al. (2001a) make a step in that direction:\na voicing detector is used to split the patches further into parts containing harmonic energy and\nthe others containing in–harmonic energy. Further, an adaptive noise estimate which assigns\nprobability to each point is used to create the initial “soft” SNR masks (Section 6.4.1).\nIt is worth stressing again that the grouping process that creates the patches does not label\nthem as speech or noise. After the decoding of the data has finished, the best path is backtracked\nand only then the mask giving rise to that path is established. The grouping is completed together\nwith the decoding.\nAt present no patches overlap (each point in the T–F plane belongs to one patch only), and\nthe “grouping process” does not associate probability estimates with the patches (“how likely it\nis that a group of points in the T–F plane were generated by a same source“).1\nFigure 7.1 depicts the original mask on the top panel. It was derived with stationary noise\nestimation followed by local SNR estimation and thresholding (Section 6.3.1). The noise is artificial\ndiagonal chirps. The mask is broken into patches shown in the same colour on the middle panel.\nEach patch is either speech or noise exclusively. During the decoding, the decoders examine both\nhypotheses, and only the more likely is retained when the decoders merge at the end of a patch.\nAfter the decoding, the patches belonging to the recognised sequence are backtracked and shown\non the bottom panel. The multisource decoding improves the accuracy of the MD ASR with non–\nstationary noise and at low SNRs (Barker et al., 2001a). The improvement seems proportional to\nthe non–stationarity of the noise.\nThe four–bands break-up of the initial mask was chosen empirically. It seems that making\nthe fragments smaller2 hinders the performance.3 This is reminiscent of MLM (previous chapter,\npp. 101): choosing the feature to be present or missing solely to maximise local state likelihood\nalone leads to highly likely (Q∗ , W ∗ ) (higher then the Q∗ of the correct model W ) but poor accu1 although the “soft” mask assigns some probability to whether the point is speech or noise, this is unrelated to\nthe bottom–up (BU) constraints suspected of restricting which points can locally be grouped together as coming\nfrom the same source\n2 ex: dividing the mask in tiles instead of whole bands\n3 J. Barker, personal communication\n\n\fCHAPTER 7. DISCUSSION\n\n119\n\nracy. The reason may be that although the resulting mask M 0 gives rise to high P (O|M 0 , Q∗ , W ),\nthe probability of the mask itself P (M 0 |Q∗ , W ) is very low. A particular collection of points may\ngive rise to high likelihood (of some model), but it is unlikely that the points in the collection\nalone were generated by a single source.\nDeveloping models that will capture the BU constraints of which points can be grouped together\nseems to promise improvement of the ASR performance in non–stationary noise.\n\n7.2.2\n\nMultistream and multiband approaches to ASR\n\nThe multistream approach to ASR is based on combining several streams of evidence (Bourlard\net al., 1996). The streams of evidence can be recombined at certain points, synchronously (the\neasier case) or asynchronously (harder, and with tenuous advantage over the synchronous case).\nWith this architecture, it’s easy to envisage integration of evidence coming from different types of\nfeatures on different time scales, and/or from different sources and/or modalities. For example,\nDupont and Bourlard (1997) combined evidence from short (10ms, phoneme) and longer (200ms,\nsyllable level) term features in a context of a hybrid system.\nA special case of the multistream approach is the multiband approach (Bourlard et al., 1996;\nHagen et al., 1998; Cerisara et al., 1998; McCourt et al., 1998; Sarikaya and Gowdy, 1998; Hagen\net al., 2000). The separate streams are (critical) bands of a filterbank. All acoustic processing is\nperformed independently in each subband. This results in as many streams of features as there\nare subbands. They or their scores can be further combined in a final classifier. For example,\nTibrewala and Hermansky (1998) extracted all pole PLP features independently (across bands)\nfrom the filterbank energies of seven separate bands (each spanning across two critical bands), and\nthen recombined the (context independent) phone posteriors synchronously via a recombination\nnetwork. Okawa et al. (1998) merged all the features in a single vector and classified using that\nhuge feature vector alone.\nThere are several reasons in favour of the multistream approach:\n• Allen (1994)’s review of the work of Fletcher about the intelligibility of low and high–pass\nfiltered speech seems to suggest that humans process speech in more or less independent\nbands. The so called “product of error“ rule (a conjecture that probability of human hearing\nmaking error is a product of the error rates in the individual bands) can be accounted for\nby this model.\n• Per–band feature modelling (typically all–pole) should give more accurate models simply\ndue to less variation present when each band is treated in isolation.\n• Different recognition strategies may be more effective in different bands. For example, different windows and time/frequency trade–off for different bands.\n• Allowing asynchrony between the bands may lessen some of the constraints of the current\nmodels. Mirghafori and Morgan (1998) tested the assumption that transitions between the\nsounds in the natural speech occur asynchronously across the bands. The findings seem to\nsuggest that a significant number of transitions (about one third) occur more then 50ms apart\nfrom each other in different bands, with high frequency bands timings spread dependent on\nthe speaking rate.\n• It seems no significant phonetic information is lost due to independent processing in each\nband (Mirghafori and Morgan, 1998).\nWith regards to the problem of robustness in ASR, the multiband approach is particularly\nsuited to band limited noise. As long as the noise leaves some bands unaffected, there is enough\ninformation in the remaining bands for ASR.\nThe multiband approach has interesting connection to missing data–once the garbled bands are\nidentified, in the recombination stage all evidence coming from that band is completely disregarded.\nThis is akin to marginalisation of the unreliable features. However, the hybrid ASR systems (most\n\n\fCHAPTER 7. DISCUSSION\n\n120\n\noften used in multistream/multiband ASR) trained on clean speech and with no data missing can\nnot be easily adapted to handle partial evidence (see Section 3.4.2). Therefore as many recognisers\nneed to be trained (with parts of the spectrum missing) as there are possible combinations of\nmissing/present bands (Hagen et al., 1998, 2000). This clearly limits the number of possible\nstreams of evidence that can be used and this number is rarely greater then seven.\n\n7.2.3\n\n“Bounded masking” by Holmes and Sedgwick (1986)\n\nHolmes and Sedgwick (1986) work is an early precursor of one of the techniques presented in\nthis thesis. Starting with different motivation (modelling the effects of masking in noisy speech),\na technique which is essentially the bounded marginalisation (Chapter 6.3.2) is developed and\napplied both to a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) as well as an HMM recogniser. This work is\npioneering in several other respects. For example, it stresses the importance of keeping the noise\nwhich is localised in the T–F plane local in the further stages of processing (i.e. using spectral\nfilterbanks rather then LPC coefficients).4 After some study, de Veth et al. (1999) conclude the\nsame a decade latter. Holmes and Sedgwick (1986) further give a recipe of training with noisy\ndata, and advise on the perils of relying on quiet parts of the spectrum that may be swamped\nwith noise later.\nHowever, the work is in the context of noise masking and does not go any further than that.\nThere is no notion of a general binary mask that (economically) separates the speech and the\nnoise. Nor that it may be formed by enforcing the BU constraints to group patches of points in\nthe T–F plane that come from the same source.\n\n7.2.4\n\nHMM decomposition by Varga and Moore (1990)\n\nVarga and Moore (1990) introduced the HMM decomposition method (reviewed in Section 2.8.2)\nas a means of decoding multiple sources from a single sequence of observations. Like the work\npresented here, they also use spectral features and assume that the MAX operator combines the\nspeech and the noise observations into noisy ones. Most often the number of sources is limited to\n2 (as the size of the search space increases exponentially with the number of sources) with one of\nthe sources being the speech source, while the other is the noise source.\nThis is a general method for combining any sources of variability in an observed signal, provided\nthat the way they combine to yield the observation is known. An N–dimensional Viterbi search\n(N being the number of sources) is used to find the most likely sequence of states in the joint\nstate–space.\nThe main differences of the approach compared to the MD work presented here are:\n• HMM decompositions decodes all speech sources even if one of them only is of interest. It\nprovides a complete solution. But usually the sequence of states some of the sources went\nthrough (e.g. the noise source) is of little interest.5 In decomposition’s terms, MD ignores\nthe noise by assuming that in the missing points all values of the noise (and hence the speech)\nare equally likely between 0 and the noisy observation.\n• When applied to recognising of speech in noise6 , it is assumed that the noise model brings\nvaluable constraints to the decoding process. However, the sources are independent. Their\nstate transition probabilities are independent. Their only interaction is through the environmental function (MAX in this case). MD’s assumptions in composition’s terms would be\nequivalent to a noise model which:\n4 even experienced researchers sometimes get surprised how similar the spectrograms of e.g. 0dB SNR look like\nto the spectrogram of the corresponding clean speech (with all the important speech structures clearly visible),\nwhile the difference in WERs the contemporary ASR systems achieve is stark\n5 it is possible to SUM (as opposed to MAX) the paths in the dimensions of the sources that aren’t of interest;\naveraging over the possible states for the not–of–interest–sources may bring increased accuracy\n6 model decomposition is a general technique, and it has also been applied to recognition and separation of\nsimultaneous multi–speech\n\n\fCHAPTER 7. DISCUSSION\n\n121\n\n– has as many states as frames, with the probability of the transition between successive\nstates 1 while the rest of the transition probabilities are 0\n– state dependent continuous probability density function which: for the noise points\nassigns equal probability of 1/o to the noise values between 0 and the observed value o,\nand 0 out of this interval; for the speech points it assumes the noise was 0 with absolute\ncertainty (the distributions is a Dirac delta function)\nWhether one considers a prior noise model to be stronger (more constrained) then the one\nequivalent to the MD assumptions, may depend on what is deemed “noise”. To the “speech\ntechnologist” noise is mostly synonymous with “not speech”. In the “hearing community” the\nterm seems more specific: a sound with no discernible structure is noise – the rest are sounds.7\nWhen considered in its stricter sense (the latter case), noise should bring large variance, and\nhence weak constraints. When considered in the wider sense (the former case) the noise model\nmay bring constraints not captured by the MD model.8\nThe advantages of decomposition seem proportional to the amount of structure in the interfering sounds. For sounds of weak structure the properties of the speech alone may be enough\nto guide the separation. For example, Hirsch and Pearce (2000) reported on noisy training with\nspeech mixed with 4 noises, and testing on the same 4 noises as well as 4 other, unseen noises.\nThe differences in performance on the seen and the unseen noises was very small.\nTo bridge the gap of orders of magnitude between HSR and ASR in a real life environment,\nboth approaches (with MD augmented with models capturing the BU constraints) may need to\nbe applied in concert.\nIntegrated models of signal and background by Rose, Hofstetter, and Reynolds (1994)\nRose, Hofstetter, and Reynolds (1994) extend Varga and Moore (1990)’s work and treat the\nproblem of merging any two (or more) discrete state–space models in a combined model in its full\ngenerality. Environmental functions other then MAX, and different feature domains (and how they\ninfluence the choice of the mixing function) are considered. The specifics of the MD model (MAX\nfunction, compressed spectral features) correspond to the special case of HMM decomposition\ndiscussed above.\n\n7.3\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n7.3.1\n\nIs mask estimation just another name for noise estimation?\n\nMask estimation can be achieved through noise estimation, followed by local SNR estimation, as\npresented in this work. But it is not limited to it.\nMask estimation can also be accomplished via CASA. However limited in their utility, the\nCASA systems built over the past couple of decades are proof of a concept that separation using\nthe properties of the speech alone is achievable. This is the important assumption for any practical\napplication.\nIt is also worth repeating that the motivation for using a binary mask is not just an assumption\nof convenience. The principle of exclusive allocation (a point in a T–F plane is either speech or\nnoise, without any go–betweens) is not advocated for any domain other than compressed spectral\nfeatures. Choosing the mask as an interface between the separation and the recognition part of\nthe system is not only supported by what we know about human hearing, but has already been\nutilised in computational models both for recognition (HMM decomposition) and separation (Wu\net al., 1998a).\n7 e.g. a roaring bus passing nearby is noise to the former, or another sound in the auditory scene to the latter\n8 it seems the two communities treat the sounds that have prominent structure along the frequency axis only\n(significantly change along the frequency axis, but not in time) of the T-F plane (e.g. “coloured noise”)\n\n\fCHAPTER 7. DISCUSSION\n\n122\n\nThe CASA systems built so far have been mostly knowledge based, rather then statistical.\nTheir drawbacks are typical of that approach, have prevented their further development, and are\nreminiscent of the drawbacks of the ASR systems that predated the current statistical ones:\n• complex models, not really trainable on a large corpus of data\n• difficulty reconciling multiple, and sometimes conflicting, sources of evidence\nwith the added\n• impossible to integrate with ASR systems, apart from being an entirely independent frontend\nHowever, these drawbacks can be tackled successfully (as was the case with the ASR systems)\nin a data driven system. Work toward learning what is speech from the data has been reported\nrecently. Ris (2000) trained a neural network to estimate the posterior probability of the mask\ngiven the noisy data. Seltzer, Raj, and Stern (2000) trained a multivariate Gaussian classifier\nto assess the probability of a feature being present or missing. Brown, Wang, and Barker (2001)\nintegrated a connectionist CASA system with missing data ASR. All attempts reported significant\nperformance improvements.\n\n7.3.2\n\nCan acoustic evidence alone guide the separation?\n\nWhen the non–speech features are matched with speech models, they typically fall in very low\ndensity regions. These points are known as outliers. When some speech state during the Viterbi\nsearch produces an extremely low score, every path passing through it will have an extremely low\nscore. The acoustic back–off technique (de Veth et al., 1998) allocates a minimal constant probability mass for every observation, limiting how low a score can become. The UNION model (Ming\net al., 2000) models the speech vectors p.d.f. with a form that is a sum of products. Consequently,\nthe products containing outliers are very small and contribute little to the sum. Similarly, the\nfull combination multiband approach (Hagen et al., 1998, 2000) sums the acoustic evidence over\nall possible combinations of present/missing data in every frame and relies on outliers to cancel\nthemselves out in the sum.\nThese methods seem to be more beneficial for artificial then real noises. They suffer from\ncommon problems:\n• patches of realistic noise will match some speech states; hence noise may not always result\nin an outlier9\n• all possible combinations of the reliable features are weighted equally, as if all possible masks\nM have the same probability P (M |Q, W )\nThe experiment with the MLM (pp. 101) points to the limitations of using the ASR acoustic\nmodels to select features as speech or non–speech. It seems that the speech models capture a\nset of constraints different then the ones pertinent to the BU grouping. So, while all the above\nreferenced work uses some of the ideas that motivated the MD work presented here (exclusive\nallocation, localised disturbance of the features) in various ways, other ideas, maybe important\nfor increased robustness (mainly regarding the separation part of an integrated ASR–separation\nsystem), are omitted from consideration.\n\n7.3.3\n\nWhat about convolutional noise?\n\nThe MD work presented here is entirely concerned with additive noise only. We have no reasons to\nbelieve that the principle of disjoint allocation of energy (central to the MD techniques) is true for\nconvolutional noise. On the contrary, a limited test carried out on test C of the Aurora 2 database\n(containing artificially induced convolutional noise) suggest that MD techniques as presented here\n9 stated p.d.f. p(x|q) models the speech source only; we have no reason to assume anything about the joint\nspeech–noise p.d.f. p(xp , xm |q)\n\n\fCHAPTER 7. DISCUSSION\n\n123\n\nare not suitable for convolutional noise. Using the apriori masks, it was found that the speech\nmodels, rather then mask estimation, are to blame. Spectral domain features are susceptible to\nthe spectral tilt introduced by the convolutional noise. The models expect energy in the wrong\nfrequency bins and perform poorly even at high SNRs and apriori mask.\n\n7.4\n\nProblems with the MD model for ASR\n\n7.4.1\n\nMask estimation\n\nThe identification of the speech regions is the main problem at present. The apriori oracle masks\nindicate that the principal gap between the achievable and achieved performance is due to poor\nmask estimation. In this work a stationary (in the former) and adaptive (in the latter set of\nexperiments) noise estimation was used. Recently it was augmented by harmonicity based CASA\nas well as apriori 4–band mask grouping in the multisource decoder (Section 7.2.1). The problem\nof separating the speech from the rest of the auditory scene even in simple acoustic environments\nremains challenging.\n\n7.4.2\n\nMerging the likelihoods during MD Viterbi search\n\nIt is not completely clear what is the best way to merge the likelihoods resulting from paths with\ndifferent masks. This problem does not arise in the “single source” Viterbi search, as all paths\n“see” the same data. However, it does arise in the context of the multisource decoder. Dividing\nthe probability mass from the missing features by the range of integration to yield an “average\nlikelihood” (for the assumed noise model) has been used so far. But the problem re–emerges\nwhen dealing with any features that need to be marginalised completely as no bounds are known,\nand carry no information whatsoever about the source (e.g. when missing delta features without\nbounds).\n\n7.4.3\n\nChoice of features for separation and recognition\n\nSeparation (and noise estimation) usually require frequency domain features. For example, good\nfrequency resolution is necessary for on–line noise estimation. In contrast, ASR models are generally better–off with features that contain information about the gross vocal tract shape only\n(spectral envelope) – not the fine spectrum. At present, the former set of features is converted to\nthe latter by frequency axis warping, compression, projection on cosine basis and truncation (Mel–\nfrequency cepstral coefficients, MFCCs). The nature of the transform path makes the merger of\nthe separation and recognition techniques difficult. The noise which is localised in the T–F plane,\nin which the principle of disjoint allocation of energy holds (after the compression), is spread\nover every cepstral coefficient.10 Spectral features are correlated and need more Gaussians in the\nmodels to capture those correlations (compared to MFCCs). Subtracting the channel dependent\nlong term component of the spectrum also seems somewhat less effective then cepstral subtraction\nfor channel normalisation. The truncation of the cepstral coefficients (typically, only the first 12\nout of 24 are retained) also provides a certain resilience to noise (especially at high SNRs). More\nfundamentally, separation makes use of speech features (like F0 ) which are speaker dependent,\nwhile the recognition subsystem needs as speaker independent features as possible.\n10 it was also argued that the whole conversion path is altogether prone to side effects that diminish the discrim-\n\ninability between the vowels when the pitch increases (de Cheveigne and Kawahara, 1999); it seems that sampling\nthe short spectrum at the harmonics of the fundamental F0 provides information about the gross spectral shape\nand is not affected by the pitch change\n\n\fCHAPTER 7. DISCUSSION\n\n7.5\n\nFuture work\n\n7.5.1\n\nData driven masks models\n\n124\n\nIt was already noted in Section 7.3.1 that it seems probable that further gains in robust ASR will\ncome from data driven separation models, which are computationally trackable and trainable on\na large corpus of data. The data needed can be easily generated as apriori masks. It would be\nadvantageous if such techniques not only single out the most probable mask, but also produce a\nprobability distribution for all possible masks.\nFor example, one possibility is to infer a state dependent model for the apriori (before any\ndata is seen)11 distribution P (M |Q, W ) of the apriori masks. Training data can be produced from\nstate force aligned speech and apriori masks. This is akin to Viterbi (rather then Baum–Welch)\ntraining, as every state is assigned\na pool\nFor binary feature vectors a Bernoulli\nP\nQ ofi data vectors.\n1−mi\nmixture p.d.f. P (m|q, W ) = k P (k) i µm\nmay be used for modelling (Carreirai,k (1 − µi,k )\nPerpiñán and Renals, 2000). While this above may capture some of the apriori probability of a\nmask, ultimately features osep pertinent to the separation process will need to be used in a mask\nmodel P (M |Osep , Q).\n\n7.5.2\n\nCoupling separation and recognition for better models\n\nSpeech separation/enhancement researchers tend to use a simple speech model, while ASR researchers tend to assume a simple environmental model. Usually, the former model the speech\nsource as static, without time structure. While the latter assume that the convolutional noise\nis constant and that additive noise is slowly changing. It maybe beneficial to reconsider the\ntrade–offs in both cases. For example, Acero, Altschuler, and Wu (2000) reported on using both\na more complex environmental and speech model. The usual obstacle is that the ASR features\nare in domain where separation model becomes complicated, without closed form solutions. The\nautoregressive (AR) speech models (Logan, 1998) may be one possible compromise.\n\n7.5.3\n\nA speculation on an integrated speech separation and recognition\nmodel\n\nModel (de)composition, with the speech along X, the mask along Y , and the time along Z axis is\nused to tie the separation and recognition parts of the system together. For the purposes of mask\nestimation, the source can be in several states. For each “separation state” qY either:\n• a separate algorithm for identification of a particular cue thought to be important for BU\ngrouping is applied (e.g. identification of harmonics, onsets, offsets, common modulation,\netc)12\nor\n• the states are purely a modelling tool to achieve a better mask model, with no explicit\nrelation to the auditory grouping cues13\nModels and topology\nBoth speech and mask models are HMMs. The speech model is a straight–through standard speech\nHMM with states qX with a distribution of p(o|m, qX ), where m is a binary mask. The mask\nHMM is a “noise–like” HMM with interconnected\nstates qY , each with a probability distribution\nQ\n2 mi\n2 1−mi\ni\np(o|m, qY ). For example, p(o, m|qY ) = i µm\nN\n(o\n(1 − µi )1−mi N (oi ; µ2,i , σ2,i\n)\ni ; µ1,i , σ1,i )\ni\nQ\nQ mi\n2 mi\n2 1−mi\nwith p(o|m, qY ) = i N (oi ; µ1,i , σ1,i ) N (o; µ2,i , σ2,i )\nand p(m|qY ) = i µi (1 − µi )1−mi\n11 not to be confused with apriori mask, or even probability of apriori mask – which is 1\n12 similarly to an early CASA system by Weintraub (1985)\n13 but we would expect that during training cues pertinent to BU grouping will be “discovered” from the data\n\n\fCHAPTER 7. DISCUSSION\n\n125\n\nfor a joint Gaussian distribution for the continuous observations and Bernoulli distribution for the\ndiscrete mask. This distribution is different from p(o|m, qX ) in that it expresses the probability\nof any speech, not a particular sound in the language.\nFeatures\nFeatures o are compressed FFT magnitude or auditory filterbank features with fine spectral resolution. For the speech states the p.d.f. is p(o|m, qX ) (not mere p(o|qX )) and most of the points\nare usually missing. The feature vector has many more dimensions then usual for recognition,\nhence:\n• MG (pp. 85), instead of BMG (pp. 85) is used to match the evidence, with the counterevidence ignored\nor\n• the evaluation is computationally intensive\nUsing the features this way solves the problems of: (a) choice of different features for separation\nand recognition; (b) decorrelation; and (c) sampling the envelope of the spectrum instead of its\nfine structure.14\nTraining\nThe parameters of the speech model are inferred separately from the mask model using clean\nspeech. The mask model is inferred from noisy speech and apriori masks. Or both are inferred\nsimultaneously, with a joint–estimation scheme similar to the ones presented by Kadirkamanathan\nand Varga (1991), Roweis (2000) and Graciarena (2000).\nTesting – recognition, separation, or both\nDecoding along the X axis only (with “don’t care” along Y axis, i.e. paths along Y axis are\nSUMmed together, not MAXimised) to find the best path in that direction amounts to recognition:15\nQ∗X\n\n=\n\nargmaxP (QX |O) = argmaxP (O|QX )P (QX )\nQX\n\n=\n\nargmax\nQX\n\n=\n\nargmax\nQX\n\n=\n\nargmax\nQX\n\nXX\nQY\n\nQX\n\nP (O|M, QX , QY )P (M |QY )P (QY )P (QX )\n\nM\n\nX X P (O|M, QX )P (O|M, QY )\nQY\n\nM\n\nP (O|M )\n\nP (M |QY )P (QY )P (QX )\n\nX X P (O|M, QX )P (O|M, QY )P (M |QY )P (QY )P (QX )\nP\n\nQY\n\nM\n\n0\n0\n0\nQ0 P (O|M,QY )P (M |QY )P (Y )\nY\nP\nQY ” P (M |QY ”)P (QY ”)\n\nSeparation amounts to finding the most likely mask M ∗ :\nX\nM ∗ = argmaxP (M |O) = argmax\nP (O|M, QY )P (M |QY )P (QY )\nM\n\n(7.1)\n\nM\n\n(7.2)\n\nQY\n\n14 de Cheveigne and Kawahara (1999) demonstrated that this works for synthetic vowels; for the purpose of this\nspeculation it is assumed that the same or similar is true for real sounds and all phones; it is also reminiscent of the\n“spectral peaks” MD work of Barker (1998) (Section 2.7.7), with the mask playing the role of the peaks detector\n15 conditioning of the word W for Q\nX is dropped; P (a|b, c, d) = P (a|b, d)P (a|c, d)/P (a|d) iif b and c are independent; QX and QY are independent; M does not depend on QX\n\n\fCHAPTER 7.

However, in a less restricted environment desirable for many\napplications, their performance degrades dramatically rendering them unusable. The lack of robustness has been identified as the most significant limitation of the current technology (Sagayama\nand Kiyoami, 1997).\nThe present systems assume first and foremost a single source. Attempts to accommodate the\nbasic design for multiple sources during the Aurora 2 competition seem to suggest that:\n• Even training with noisy data (multiconditional baseline) when the noise is known in advance\ndoes not achieve the performance needed for many applications.16\n• The performance gains achieved are mainly due to:\n– frame deletion – frames considered too noisy are discarded\n– cleaning of the noisy speech via algorithms that use the gross speech features (e.g.\nharmonicity) to discriminate between the speech and the noise\nRegarding the first point, the techniques presented here offer possible gains which exceed what is\ncurrently possible with matched training, as demonstrated with the apriori oracle masks (pp. 112–\n113).\nWith regards to the second point, using the “ideal” filter (the apriori masks) demonstrates\nthat it is not the faulty models that cause the performance loss. But rather feeding the models\nnon–speech when they expect speech is the main reason for degradation.\nThe problem of lack of robustness seems to be one of separation, rather than of poor speech\nmodelling. The only untapped source of constraints at the moment appear to be the BU constraints\npertinent to “grouping”, as discussed in Chapter 4. On its part, the ASR backend can make the\ntask of the separation frontend easier by foregoing full speech spectrum reconstruction. Merely\nidentifying the speech parts in a sounds mixture should suffice for the ASR backend.\nIn this work we have experimented with some aspects of a possible system that may implement\nthese ideas. We believe to have demonstrated that:\n• The hard problem of ASR of speech in noise can be separated into two subproblems –\nspeech identification and recognition of the partial speech. Treating the mask that binds\nboth subsystems as a random variable opens opportunities to tackle the mask estimation\nproblem.\n• Using the partial spectrum for recognition is good enough for ASR not only with artificial,\nbut also with realistic noises. Hence an enhancement frontend which reconstructs the whole\nspectrum is not necessary.\n16 a probable application of the connected digits task is phone dialling by voice; the target sentence error rate\n(SER) is about 3%, which requires WER of about 0.3%\n\n\fCHAPTER 7. DISCUSSION\n\n127\n\n• However, if needed for a particular application (e.g. speech enhancement), the missing parts\nof the spectrum can be reconstructed during the decoding in a principled way and employing\na strong speech model (as provided by the recogniser) for this purpose.\n• Further gains in robust ASR at mid and low SNRs are achievable through better modelling\nof the identification/separation frontend of the system.\n• Tapping into the BU constraints by devising appropriate features for the “cues” and modelling them accordingly is likely to lead to better recognition accuracy in less controlled\nenvironments.\nIn the end, several commonly held assumptions (Peters et al., 1999)17 about how humans and\nmachines hear may need to be revisited if machines are to approach human hearing in its resilience\nto noise.\n\n17 Peters et al. (1999) reversed the tables and played to trained human subjects speech that has been processed\nby a standard ASR frontend and then reconstructed; HSR deteriorated with each step along the ASR frontend\nprocessing chain; the decrease is ever larger as the SNR decreases\n\n\fAppendix A\n\nComparative performance of\ntechniques for noise robust ASR\nAn incomplete list of improvements in the accuracy of various ASR systems with proposed techniques for robust ASR published in the surveyed literature:\nTechnique and/or reference\n\nVocabulary Spea- Noise\nker(s)\n\nBaseline\n\nSS\n(Lockwood\nBoudy, 1991)\n\nand\n\nNSS (Lockwood\nBoudy, 1991)\n\nand\n\n43\nisolated\nwords\n43\nisolated\nwords\n\nSS (Xie and Campernolle, 1993)\nNSS (Xie and Campernolle, 1993)\nNSS+noise\nvariance\n(Xie and Campernolle,\n1993)\nAdaptive Wiener filter\n(Vaseghi and Milner,\n1993)\nWarped Wiener filter\n(Agarwal and Cheng,\n1999)\nKlatt (1976) algorithm\n(Varga et al., 1988)\nBridle et al.

However, it is of interest to consider what\nhappens if the features undergo a linear transform before the pattern matching phase. This is often\nthe case in the contemporary ASR systems. The systems utilise the envelope of some spectral\nrepresentation, rather then spectral representation itself. The spectral envelope is much more\nspeaker and pitch independent, while allowing speech discrimination. It is also advantageous\nto use a transform that approximately decorrelates the features, thus reducing the number of\nGaussians in the mixture needed to accurately model the correlations between the features in the\nstate p.d.f.s1 . The Discrete Cosine Transform (Rao and Yip, 1990) is routinely used with the\nspeech signal to achieve both.\nLets assume that the spectral feature vector x undergoes a linear transform Cx before being\nused in the state likelihood computation Eq. (5.12). The contribution of each individual Gaussian\nto the likelihood (with conditioning on the state and mixture dropped) is:\np(x) = N (Cx; µ, Σ) =\n\n1\n(2π)k/2 |Σ|1/2\n\nT\n\n1\n\n−1\n\ne− 2 (Cx−µ) Σ\n\n(Cx−µ)\n\n(C.1)\n\nwhere Σ is diagonal, and C is a linear transform matrix with dimensionality k x (p + m) (p is the\nnumber of\nR present, and m the number of missing features). The aim is to compute the marginal\np(xp ) = p(x)dxm .\nWith suitable reordering of the rows of x and columns of C we have:\n· ¸\n£\n¤\n£\n¤\nxp\nx=\n, C = Cp Cm , Cx − µ = Cp xp + Cm xm − µ ,\n(C.2)\nxm\nwhere xp and xm are vectors with dimensions p and m respectively and Cp and Cm are matrices of\nk x p and k x m elements respectively.

Note that the\ncontributions of the known features xp are also absent from the remaining form (being absorbed\n#\nin µ1 = −Cm\n(Cp xp − µ)). This is unsatisfactory, but expected – a linear combination of a known\nand unknown values can take any value in (−∞, ∞).\nIf the integral is definite with a rectangular hyper-volume of integration, it can not be evaluated\nT −1\nΣ Cm is a non diagonal\nconveniently. The covariance matrix Σ1 is not diagonal (as Cm in Cm\nmatrix), preventing factorisation of the p.d.f. and evaluation of the multidimensional integral as a\nproduct of one dimensional integrals. Numerical methods that evaluate the integral by sampling\nthe space do exist (see Genz (1993) and references therein; the lower and higher bounds on the\nintegral from Eq. (C.4) decompose to a difference of multivariate normal probabilities). But they\ncan hardly be considered suitable in the context of an HMM system where the probability in\nEq. (C.4) is calculated for every frame and for every state.\n\n\fAppendix D\n\nEfficient calculation of the\nlikelihood of the MD model with\nfactorisable probability functions\nThe missing data model for speech recognition (Section 5.3) depends on summation of the partial\nlikelihood over all possible masks, weighed by their respective probability (Eqs. 5.2 and 5.3, pp. 69):\nX\nW ∗ ≈ argmax\nP (O|M, Q∗ , W )P (M |Q∗ , W )P (Q∗ |W )P (W )\n(D.1)\nW\n\nor\n\nall M\n\nW ∗ ≈ argmax\nW\n\nX\n\nP (O|M, Q∗ , W )P (Q∗ |W )P (M |W )P (W )\n\n(D.2)\n\nall M\n\nUnder the i.i.d. assumptions the probabilities of the sequence of vectors decompose into products\nof the individual vectors probabilities. Still, it is not clear how to efficiently calculate the weighted\nsum over all possible masks in every time frame.\nFortunately, if both p(o(t)|m(t), q ∗ (t), W ) and P (m(t)|q ∗ (t), W ) (or P (m(t)|W )) are factorisable or weighted sums of factorisable distributions, an efficient calculation of the sum over all\nmasks is possible. Lets consider the case when the state p.d.f. p(o(t)|m(t), q ∗ (t), W ) is a weighted\nsum of product of factors (ex: a mixture of Gaussians with diagonal covariance matrices) and\nP (m(t)|q ∗ (t), W ) (or P (m(t)|W )) is factorisable probability distribution function:\nX\nX\nY\np(o(t)|m(t), q ∗ (t), W ) =\nP (k)p(o(t)|k, m(t), q ∗ (t), W ) =\nP (k)\npi (oi (t)|k, mi (t), q ∗ (t), W )\nk\n\nk\n\ni\n\nwhere k indexes the mixture components, while i indexes the features in the feature vector.

EFFICIENT SUMMATION OVER ALL MASKS\n\n139\n\nFor N = 2 we have:\nS2 =\n\n3\nX\n\n{ck1j ck2j s1j s2j }\n\nj=0\n\n= bk1 bk2 (1 − r1 )(1 − r2 ) + bk1 ak2 (1 − r1 )r2 + ak1 bk2 r1 (1 − r2 ) + ak1 ak2 r1 r2\n{z\n} |\n{z\n} |\n{z\n} | {z }\n|\nj=00\n\nj=01\n\nj=11\n\nj=10\n\n= bk1 (1 − r1 )[bk2 (1 − r2 ) + ak2 r2 ] + ak1 r1 [bk2 (1 − r2 ) + ak2 r1 ]\n= [bk1 (1 − r1 ) + ak1 r1 ][bk2 (1 − r2 ) + ak2 r2 ]\n=\n\n2\nY\n\n(D.8)\n\n[bki (1 − ri ) + aki ri ]\n\ni=1\n\nLets assume that our claim (Eq.

(D.6) for N = n + 1.\nThe sum is as convenient as it is intuitive: the sum of the data likelihoods over all possible\nmasks weighted by the probability of each mask can be computed using the sum of the individual\nfeatures likelihoods, each weighted by the probability of being present or missing. The assumptions\nused are that both the data likelihood and the mask likelihood are weighted sums of factorisable\ndistributions. They are observed in a typical HMM system.\n\n\fAppendix E\n\nAttributions\nThe work reported in this thesis has been done in collaboration with several members of the\nSpeech and Hearing Group (SPandH) in the Department of Computer Science at the Sheffield\nUniversity, UK, during the course of several years. A. Morris did a lot of the earlier work on\nmissing data ASR. A. Vizinho was instrumental in the work on separation using local SNR based\nestimation. M. Cooke was the first to realise that the large number of insertions appearing in the\nframes with little reliable data can be solved by using bounded marginalisation instead of mere\nmarginalisation. He also suggested a mask reliability measure derived from the local SNR estimate\nvia a sigmoid mapping. J. Barker not only provided the tools (the CTK) for the latter set of the\nexperiments, but also verified many of the results via separate and independent experiments. P.\nGreen was also fully involved in all aspects of the work reported in this thesis.\nPortions of the work reported in this thesis have been published in the following papers:\n• P.D. Green, J.

When rates rise, commercial banks tend to widen net interest margins while savers with meaningful assets benefit from higher coupons on rolled-over government paper. Households with floating-rate debt feel the other side of the equation. LJ’s point is that these flows aren’t “just markets”; they’re policy-shaped—and the state itself can (and should) hold productive assets to create passive income, reducing the temptation to solve everything through higher taxes.\n\nThe micro-level lesson rhymes with the macro: compounding shows up only if you give it time. Selling a winner too early (e.g., exiting a strong company out of short-term fear) can erase years of future compounding. The antidote is a simple, boring practice—start early, automate contributions, and avoid decisions driven by anxiety or headlines. Portfolio rules that prevent impulsive selling are, in practice, guards against your future regret.",

PIVOT back!\n>   + One man show for itrade does not work. But one man + many AI agents = that should work!\n>   + Have pytrade. AI rewrite of itrade in python, in 1:1 backward-compatible transparent way.\n>   + Swtich to pytrade, from itrade: (a) analytics, (b) modeller, (c) models/fits, (d) optimiser/setup, (e) simulator, (f) reporting.\n\n> (j) Quant trading, research, development. +ve known, -ve tad bored, non-inspiring env.\n>   Keep to the \"trading into the sunset\" plan. Need a trading engine to get to 2bps trading costs. Signals are less important for time being. Engine in C++ is most important atm.\n\n> - LJ trading into the sunset:\n>   (a) A single codebase for the entire system, all hands work on the same codebase.\n>   (b) A single World universe, members of the universe are all securities types: equities, futures, etfs, options, etc.\n>   (e) AI angle: more data, more compute, less struture... Heed Sutton's \"bitter lesson\".\n\n> - LJ love-hate relationship with the market while quant trading.\n>   HATE: I'm losing $$$ - it's physically painful... as if Mr Market screaming at me \"Idiot! Imbecile! Cretin!\"...\n>   LOVE: We put our £££ where our mouth is. We-Bet-On-It!! ... we make sh*t ton of $$$, the size of a small country GDP.\n\n> - LJ quant trading (QT) positives and negatives.\n>   QT positive: it's a profit center, not a cost center... Putting new R&D in production happens quickly.\n>   QT negatives: shift work, on-call hours, working with small fiddly numbers, low SNR... luck plays a big role.\n\n> Considerations trade-offs [ quant { boring, money } x ML { interesting, poor } ]\n\n> GEPA for stock picking bot - give it $100 to trade, keep improving. DEfinite reward but very noisy.\n\n> - LJ startup. Financial stocks picking. Doing to fundamental analysys trading what stats/portfolio optimiser did to technical analsys.\n>   Apply GEPA style to stock picker prompts. Stock picker KEEPS IMPROVING on its own... Learning from its own experience betting with $100 budget.\n>   The \"Bitter Lesson\" in finance: more data via micro transactions collection, and then going up the hierarchy. The Google of economy: gather and organise every transaction... Most likely digital central bank currency? Or crypto for the public ledger feature.\n\n> - LJ job - crypto.\n>   Away from equity trading: buy data indicator [0,1] for 100K p.a. driving portfolio of billions with slow alpha earning millions in commission.\n>   Only cryptos with public open ledger allow for \"The Google of the economy\": gather and organise every transaction... (buyer_id,seller_id,ammount currency,ammount_good/service).\n>   Mid-term quant from micro to macro: ML/AI unifies new-technical quant trading and new-fundamental GEPA self-improvement => omni-model... double entry book keeping.\n\n> - Given that price is a signal, followed through creates profit, and that firms are tyrannical hierarchical organisations—if you don't do as told you will be kicked out on the street to curl and die of hunger and exposure—then: does it mean the price people pay is their freedom? The freedom to do as they like and please?\n\n> - MMT Messaging .gov spending, deficits, bonds:\n>   (c) Gov deficit == our SURPLUS: gov spends 100, taxes 80: the private sector keeps 20\n>   (e) Selling bonds to match deficit spending is not “borrowing” from the private sector: buyers gladly swap dollars for liquid interest-bearing assets. They give up NOTHING. It’s a (unnecessary) GIFT to the bond buyers.\n>     Giving your cash for bonds is deferred consumption... So the interest on the bonds is a reward for the person that deferres the consumption.\n\n> Fiat money system, organisation and abstractions.\n>   3. It exists on a ring at level 1, connecting the CB (e.g. Bank of England - BoE) and the commercial banks (Barclays, HSBC).\n>   4. ... (a) a current account (earning =0 interest) - the reserve account. (b) a savings account (earning >0 interest) - government bonds are held there until they mature.\n>   5. Buying bonds: decrement reserve; increment bonds. Interest on bonds: increment reserve. Selling bonds: increment reserve; decrement bonds.\n\n>   12. 1. Government spends... 2. The Treasury sell bonds... 3. This money is used to settle original debt created at BoE... The bond sales happen afterwards. Hence Government doesn't borrow in order to deficit spend.\n\n> - MMT IR0 IR=0 ZIRP arguments for- and anti- having the Central Bank (CB) Interest Rate (IR) permanently set to 0 (IR0)... IR is savers' Basic Income (BI), and specifically: BI for people buying Gov bonds.\n>   Pro business IR=0: IR>0 is a cost of doing business... and passed onto customers => adds to inflation.\n\n> Afaik US can always pay its debt... Fed can always create usd to exchange for bonds as they mature.\n\n> 1%) 1% se sopstvenici na krupen kapital - ogromna aktiva (savings, property, shares, bonds), mala pasiva (dolgovi), ne moraat da rabotat, celiot income go zemaat kako pasiven",

It touches on philosophical perspectives about human nature and cooperation (Category 8) while also addressing the foundational role of family dynamics in relationship frameworks (Category 19).\n- The entry reflects on the adaptive application of political philosophies across different social scales—communism within family, socialism in close communities, democracy at state level, republicanism for national governance, and libertarianism at federal levels.

It emphasizes recognizing profiles through bios and content recall while maintaining a manageable follower-following ratio under 4K. The advice blends marketing principles (avoiding 'marketeers', 'crypto' accounts) with relationship management, reflecting both branding strategy and personal connection dynamics.\n- Discusses social media interaction strategies: blocking after bad interactions and muting instead of blocking to avoid downstream friction.

The tone is warm and reflective, fitting Category 19: Relationships & Family, which encompasses emotional well-being, connection, and the examined life centered on love and meaningful bonds.\n- The post reflects on the opportunity cost of parenthood for middle-class parents in industrialized societies, contrasting it with perceived inadequate economic incentives. It emphasizes personal decision-making around family size based on changing life circumstances, highlighting the intersection of economic reality and familial choices within a broader societal context.\n- The entry reflects on the dual role of parents in children's development—emphasizing that while parental love and attention are beneficial, there is a saturation point beyond which excessive involvement becomes harmful.
