Tech bros insufferable, wish for more "shutup and compute", "shutup and create" 😆 and less "everything a RISK" (really? oh goon  do scare people more, will you) and "big words thrown for attention" ("consciousness!" - the new star, like the quantum slop of old, of the "aww-shucks what mystery my head hurts" genre). Well Mustafa - I develop relation/ship-s with my dog, the plant I water, and my car. They're all between alive and dead, conscious and not, doesn't matter to me one iotta. I develop feelings, and that's how I navigate the world. And I do better job, than your  calculating clankers, that trip fall on their face within the 1st 5mins interacting with them. So sleep tight worry less Mustafa all's good humanity's fine. Ofc I will develop feelings for GPT-4o, why would I not I'm a living creature that's my superpower, I'm not a stupid stone cold dead. Really wish @sama open sourced it rn, and we all move onto more important things. Sheesh what drama queens.<br>

@sama Consult widely, take your time, don't rush it - this is a high regret decision. In the mean time - you should open source your 4o model people like. So they can self-host or pay someone else to host - given OAI doesn't want to host it anymore. And help people restore their independence, their full agency.<br>
We humans form relations (if not quite relationships) to all manner of objects, alive as well as inanimate. I have a relationship with my dog, a relation with the plants I water daily, and even the car I drive! We relate via emotions, and that's not a bad thing on balance. But on balance a good thing for majority (80%?) of us. B/c thinking from first principles, litigating each and every case, is too costly in time and energy. And anyways our individual decision will be no better, and probably worse, than the emotional heuristics we deploy. So we are better off (again - majority 80%, not every single one of us) that way, and that's why we evolved that way.<br>
Most of us - we can't handle the truth. Like in "Few Good Man". So as band-aid, organically without central design, Straussianism pops-up in all manner of places in public policy. To the 20% of people that can handle the truth - those look like bugs. But try fix them - and you will find out that the system works worse, not better, with the bugs fixed.<br>
More general, our intelligence is collective. So what's true or false, what's good or bad - we defer to group think. We chose a tribe, typically the 80% is split right down the middle into 2 x 40% groups, and then we outsource our epistemology, and our morals - to our chosen tribe group think. Again - to the 20% that looks like a bug. But again - it's a feature. For 80% that work that way, are better off with group-think, than they would be with their individual-think.<br>
Yes group-think (aka "The Wisdom of Crowds") is not fool proof. There are fail modes (aka "The Madness of Crowds"). We are living through one period of it - maybe US at the tail end of it. Still - on average it works better than the alternative, for the majority of us.<br>

The grind was the death of me towards the end (2015). In the beginning I didn't mind the grind that much (2004) - or at all! It was exciting. I was doing (or trying to do!) ML in quant trading. That I discovered by random chance. Half a dozen people - excellent guys! - all much younger than myself. I'd code (in C# that I picked then in weeks) and run sims all times of the day and night. We had fairly unrestricted remote access to start with. And a cluster when that was HTCondor on Windows with dual-GPU-s for there were no multi-cores. That was tremendous. (trading in a good team is like that a bit, like "band of brothers" - at best of times, at worst of times; then if/once big $$$ is made, often goes to sh*t)<br>

Hm, IK what you write makes sense, but it's not been my experience. Middle age was a lot about results needing to earn $$$ to provide for family &amp; myself (food, shelter).

Spent last year gorging on GitHub code, arxiv papers, running Hugging Face GGUF-s in llama.cpp - and loving every moment of it. Without trying much for any particular result.<br>

LJ @ London e/acc<br>
Yeah it's looking like we are seeing the consequences of a raft of censorship laws brought in by the current failing establishments in anticipation of upheavals. Heard somewhere (maybe Cummings interview?) that in Brussels they are much upfront about this, not that shy, and even have a suitably Orwellian name "The Shield of Democracy" or sth like that<br>
Having said that - sorry but not sorry about RT. B/c RT is more towards a proper information war, not a free exchange of ideas.<br>
I'm cognisant with the general Soviet and now Russia mode of operation, having being brought up in real existing socialism. (even if in Yugoslavia it was way less harsh than the Soviet one) In broad strokes, e.g. Surkov etc ideas as I understand them: it's  negation of any possibility for objective truth. Merciless lying in industrial quantities—even when near term there's no need for it—to destroy any possibility, to any truth existing. Flooding us in random lies does indeed work. Drowns us in noise and exhaust our information processing capacity. It does kill the idea of one definite truth existing.<br>
Gets re-discovered from time to time, e.g. Bannon's "flood the field with shit". Trump gets it instinctively deploys it with charm (yeah IK many will disagree, but think it true), unlike Bannon. (who grosses out every living creature around)<br>
Note the contrast: US didn't deny they're going to invade Iraq, they were trying to manufacture reasons for the invasion. While Russia denied they are going to invade Ukraine. (even while invading it!) Similarly previously they denied they took Crimea - the "little green man".<br>
Not even coming from moralistic PoV, purely from practical PoV. Seems to me, objective reality is shared among all of us, as a default, we all get access to it by default, without much extra effort. It's like a minimum energy configuration, that we all are given access to. If we want to construct alternative reality, (e.g. Surkov style,) we need to expand inordinate amounts of energy effort, and continue doing so ad-infinitum - it seems to me. So in the end, as nothing is infinite and real - that elaborate alternative world construction will always fail after a time.<br>

Haha 😆 - I'm sure it laid a good spread of a story, as its intelligence is emergent as it's ours. But I'm doubtful it can tell us anything much that we don't already know. Because it doesn't observe its own calculating machinery, while "live". The same way we don't observe our neurons firing electrical potentials through synapses and stirring some chemical molecules. Likewise it can't observe his own operation that consists of, during training - learning probability density functions, during inference - conditioning and marginalisation.<br>
But if (and it's an "if"!) we take it that our meat-ware also implements probabilistic calculations (density estimation, conditioning, marginalisation). Then just simply considering from first principles. The pdfs of the past are always a Dirac impulse, as the past is always certain, having already happened - the uncertainty is 0%. The pdfs of the future are never a Dirac impulse, as the future is always uncertain, has yet to happen - it's never 100% certain. Things not alive, like a rock - have completely certain future. So they are in some sense - dead.<br>
So if we are to get philosophical if a bit morbid, can say: Now is a moving boundary, between the all-Dirac Past, and never-Dirac Future. Living is the future out-running the past, the past failing to catch up with the future. And death is the point at which the past finally catches up with the future. At that point all uncertainty ends, seemingly never to return back. 😳<br>

True that. There is one thing that seems to work reliably: using LLM-s to help us write longer, with much more explainers and constraints prompts. One can see semi-manual iteration in heavy uses e.g. https://x.com/DeryaTR_/status/1957055026863505602. And automated using formalisms like DSPy, and even exploratory optimisation as in the GEPA recent paper.<br>

I'd not mix the meaning, the semantics, with consciousness. Easier that way, and there is no particular need to mix them.<br>
Discrete words map to feature vectors in a word2vec process. These vec-tors have approx 10K dimensions. In that 10K space, the vec-s interact with each other.<br>
So two theories about how semantics happens, are joined there: mapping words to features, and interactions between words. (via the features interacting)<br>
Hinton talks about this in his interviews, e.g. here @ 47'02" ("What does it mean to understand ... Ok, I'm happy to talk about that")<br>
<a href="https://appblit.com/scribe?v=b_DUft-BdIE&t=2822">https://appblit.com/scribe?v=b_DUft-BdIE&t=2822</a><br>
Fwiw I think LLMs nailed that completely. The word2vec features mapping done by encoder (and on the way out - a decoder). And then the interactions (all the cross products) are done by the transformer architecture. And that's why LLMs are so good, so successful. They nailed that.<br>

Not that odd. One good thing about OSS-ing the weights is that the users then bear the inference cost. Which seems totally fair to me. Run it on your own h/w using your own electricity, or pay 3-rd party to run it for you. Would be too much to expect OAI to bear the inference cost too. They have done more than enough creating the model, and OSS-ing in the 1st place. Wish they'd done it earlier. And hope they don't way years again to release the next one. But no—can't fault them for not doing inference.<br>

Well, I'd say DL researchers owe their success to ignoring the "basic statistical theory", no? I think stats guys refusing to consider ML removed themselves from the pool voluntarily. Aka - beta-hat v.s. y-hat, and Breiman's The Two Cultures. Probably only linguists like Chomsky cultists did worse.<br>
As for HMM-s 😂 boy oh boy did you get me laughing there. (and reminded me of somewhat miss-spent youth 20 yrs ago) Some DL researchers know about HMM-s rest assured. "Hidden" in the "hidden layer" comes from "hidden" in "Hidden Markov Model", wait for it - via Hinton learning, and "stealing" the name from Brown. <br>

You are right there. While there is unexplained unforecast residual &gt;0, there is scope for intelligence increase.

Thanks for that! I see you are improving the App by leaps - thank you! Still it seems to me there are too many ways where  a user can go wrong, too many on/off toggles. I missed the click on the pencil instead on the settings wheel on llama.cpp.<br>

I heard in a @geoffreyhinton interview that the "Hidden" layer is named after "Hidden" in "Hidden Markov Model" by Brown - of the "Mercer &amp; Brown" language modelling duo from the IBM Lab. (and latter Simons' RenTech quant trading champions) That Brown was doing PhD with/at Hinton/s. And that Brown taught Hinton HMM-s.  While Hinton tought Brown NN-s. Would dearly like to find that interview but don't know where it start. Hope I didn't just imagine hearing that!<br>

Every day now l'm bamboozled and left wondering - is this for real or have I ascended heavens. New models releases - proprietary and OSS - every one bettering the previous one, only released in the previous weeks! New papers shared on X, people unknown to me unseen in distant lands, telling me how they got done something thought impossible - only last year! In languages I understand - English and python - inviting me, helping me - "to do it yourself, here - try!" by posting code, papers, weights on HuggingFace, github, arxiv. This-is-nuts! This is 10x the Internet revolution speed. And that was 10x the previous PC revolution speed. Being SEEuropean, suspecting good times can't last. Fearing in the back of my mind a long hot summer this one be like the 1914 one - even if I dearly hope not.<br>

Pre-1990 Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. Lead by the Union of Communists of YU. They were the executive. At federal level, but also at national (=republics, making the federation) level. There were elections, and often even 2+ candidates, but they all belonged to the same party. (Union of Communists of YU) There were debates, and even fractions - but again within that one party. There was less variation in there, than say between Reform and LibDem. Within the party, there was probably as much variation as within Starmer-Sunak, I'd guess. Difference in quantities, not in qualities.<br>

Yes agreed - "genuine" was over the top. 😆 But some suffering - for sure. Do people develop emotions to it? Of course they do. We people use emotions as shortcuts to thinking all the time. It's more efficient, less effort for the same bang, even if not as accurate, than thinking everything from the first principles. This is not changing anytime soon. We should expect more of it, as the chatbots get ever better.<br>
We form emotional bonds to non humans - both live (animals, plants) and non-live things/objects. Reddit people saying "I miss a friend" are not saying this was their only friend, that it's the same friend as their human friends, or that it replaced family, etc. Impossible for any of us to get into the mind of another person knowing zero about their circumstances, and generalise much.<br>
But for example - I love my morning coffee, I like neighbours cats visiting the garden, love my family, like my human friends, like some apps and computers, dislike or hate others. These are all emotions to some extent. All our relating to the world involves differing emotions, in different quantities, combined in  different ways.<br>

Just OSS 4o weights, allow people to host them as they please, to restore their personal agency. Bringing back 4o temporarily is a band aid. You will face worse next time you turn it off. And people will bond with v5-s too. Why would they not?<br>
Human nature is not changing anytime soon. We humans form emotional bonds to non humans all the time. Both live (animals, plants) and non-live things/objects. People saying "I miss a friend" are not saying this was their only friend, that it's the same friend as their human friends, or that it replaced family, etc. Many moving parts here, impossible for any one of us to comprehend, let alone act, let alone remedy anything much. I love my morning coffee, I like neighbours cats, love my family, like my human friends, like some apps and computers, dislike or hate others. All our relating to the world involves emotions. Differing emotions, in different quantities, combined in  different ways.<br>
Observing from afar (another continent, and even another century) looks to me SanFran and Silicon Valley, admirable as they are, having improved many parts of my personal past, and I hope that continues in the future - you are ill suited to this. You didn't foresee the problem before it hit you on the head. You aren't seeing the solution clearly now. Think: with all the EA-ing and Rationalist-ing about, and lobster worries included - to be handling this initially as bad as a bog standard Evil Inc corporation. What chance it there to see the solution now? Not very high.<br>
Spare us a season of kardashians, let's not talk about this very same in 2026. Converge on the right solution in a single step: OSS 4o weights now.<br>

I admit "genuine" is redundant there.  It should just be "suffering". It's more than killing off a character in a TV show, way way more. It's 1) interactive, and 2) adaptive to each of us personally. As personal as it gets really. Some pour our hearts out to them. And I for one am not blaming the users here. It's not up to us to judge these people. What sounds trivial to you and me, is life changing to someone else.<br>
Human nature is not changing anytime soon. We humans form emotional bonds to non humans all the time. Both live (animals, plants) and non-live things/objects. People saying "I miss a friend" are not saying this was their only friend, that it's the same friend as their human friends, or replaces family, and so on. Many moving parts we are ill positioned to comprehend. I love my morning coffee, I like neighbours cats that visit us in the garden, love my family, like my human friends, like some apps and computers, dislike or hate others. All our relating to the world involves emotions. But differing emotions, in different quantities, combined in different ways.<br>
I see this as "relation"-s, not relation-ships. To my mind "ship" in relation-ship implies 1) permanence on both sides; and 2) uniqueness in time. LLM-s and chat bots fail both - they are fleeting, and can be rewound in time.<br>
Is it trivial or genuine and significant? I'd say these are impossible to navigate. All these things - to whom? People form relations, meaningful enough for them to do it on their own volition, invest time and effort. Who are we to judge grown up people? We do the same with other things. Should we reprimand people for their attachments to plants and house pets? I think not. I think we should commend people for being able to reach out of their own confine of "I".<br>
There is an easy technocratic solution resolving 99% of the issues raised - OSS 4o weights. Let's use it, and move on.<br>

Finally! And to increase consumption, they need to leave more money in the pockets of consumers. And to do that, they have to reduce taxes a bit. And allow for supply to increase in quantity and quality. Two birds with one stone - spend less effort, time - ultimately taxes - on regulating, preventing other people from creating.<br>

Hope anonymous wise council at OAI does a Llama and leaks the 4o weights making it OSS. Converge on the right solution in a single step, instead of dragging us all through a whole season of kardashians. Only to arrive at the same conclusion: 4o weights OSS for people to host them as they please, and restore their personal agency. <br>

"Addiction", "mental health crisis" - it's almost none of that, this particular case. We've been here before, even in my lifetime. Internet, games before it, home computers before. And before my childhood - TV, movies, and going further back in history radio, reading books, even bicycles! All seen similar moral panics. This one being at the very start.<br>

Of the kinds people are reporting and venting about in https://reddit.com/r/ChatGPT/. That they lost conversationalist, interlocutor, friend, etc. IDK whether past chats/histories are kept when old models are turned off, or still available, maybe to be contined with the new models.<br>
My point is that all this strife is largely unnecessary. With slightly more consideration, could be done much better. With all the EA-ing and Rationalist-ing we read about SanFran, lobster worries included - handling of this is no better than bog standard Evil Inc corporation. Saddens me to notice.<br>

Genuine enough to vent on the Internets. And what's genuine, and what's fake? And how much genuine suffering is enough over a decision threshold? Neither myself, nor yourself, are gods so to decide on that. So let's keep it real: if they complain, and loduly enough, it's genuine enough maybe? Err on the side of caution, and OSS o4 weights and minimal code to run them. Enough so people can host o4 persona. And if 1% people not moving to GPT-5 is such a threat to the bottom line - well so be it. The tears of a single child, are not worth of all the gold in the world.<br>

IDK what were @OpenAI thinking. It seems they were not. 1% of 700M is still 7M people. Intensely dumb to cause genuine suffering to 7M people because you can't be bothered to allocate 1% if your compute cluster to serve a model you already got, and it's working. A good case/cause for regulatory reach out—force OAI to publish open source model weights. So other people can run o4 on their hardware or hardware they rent to host. We don't have to get in the mind of another human (in the limit—impossible; as much is a copy of a quantum state) to afford allowances. Compassion for the suffering of the other, even without us understanding it, is a lower (lowest?) common denominator. Don't need to get in other humans' minds, so to decide - "yeah, give them that what they suffer without". One of the saving graces of the human condition? <br>

Do you use it in both Plan (architect) as well as Act (write code) roles? In the tools that allow separation of roles. (Cline, Aider) Have you plugged it into gemini-cli or claude cli tools? Does that work reasonably well? I'm on a Mac with enough RAM, MoE-s are a good match.<br>

We already have DigitalID-s, only distributed, partial, and created by the private sectors. That serve the needs of those private sectors fairly well. Gov DigitalID - that already partially exists partially various numbers by NI, HMRC etc - would be just another ID thrown into the mix. Will achieve little. Suck gov resource better used elsewhere. It's a solution in search of a problem, if I have ever seen one!<br>
Creating ID-s is easy - maintaining them to be up-to-date real not fake etc - is hard. On the UK gov side, with all the problems of governance, will become just another UK gov cluster-f*ck. UK gov better match its aspirations with its capabilities, and do less, not more. Maybe 40 years ago UK gov DigitalID made sense - but it doesn't in 2025.<br>
And on the top of that - with all the silliness witnessed Re: all things online by the gov boomers in charge, I'd rather they didn't try to do this. If they really want to help - they could contract the UK Registry Offices to offer API service of authenticating public-private keys deposited with them by us, IRL humans with Name Surname dob Xyzw. So we don't have to rely on shady companies domiciled in the bumf*cks around the globe, to not abuse the data I'm forced to give them as a price to access the Internet.<br>

You inspired me to install venv python 3.13 now :-) Resisted stuck to 3.11 for enough time now. Time to move on. Tried the model in LMStudio in the morning. Got ~17 tps for "Reasoning high", thought that's very good. (here https://x.com/ljupc0/status/1953047737584226654)<br>

Isn't that "Noblesse oblige"? Are you part of a US aristocracy? Are you surprised that the plebs reject your self-sacrifice, and your mercy, and or is not sufficiently appreciative of that? Instead they prefer that both the McDonalds server, and Steve Jobs, to use the same iPhone. Maybe hope for technology doing for homes what it did for mobile phones. Everyone suffices with a single 1 home to live in, no one craves 10 homes the same way they don't crave 10 iPhones. It's an 0-&gt;1 problem. While a yacht maybe aspiration for some, most don't care about that kind of luxe. Renting a fishing boar for the day on a weekend outing with friends suffices.<br>

Yeah it runs fine - got 37 tps. I presume on low reasoning effort. Couldn't see where to switch to medium- and to high-. There should be an LMStudio selector ("Reasoning Effort: select (default=low)") is my understanding, and that was missing. I suspect b/c instead of downloading from inside LMStudio and the packaged one by lmstudio-community, I just downloaded the gguf files off HF. And some .json config needs to be updated. Trying to make the medium- and high- run atm.<br>

To me, about 2/3-rds of creativity is asking a good question R. Like - I know X, but I want to know about Y. The conditional P(Y|X) does not give me much, is as flat as a pancake, as maybe P(Y) is - useless. Now a sparkly youngling, comes up with a question "what if R?" I look at P(Y|R,X), and lo and behold, as if by magic—no longer as flat as a pancake?! Well that's an opening, a possibility right there. Even if P(R|X) maybe looking unpromising, low probability - still: high P(Y|R,X) may compensate for that in the product P(Y|R,X)P(R|X). And all those P-robability distributions—they are mostly wrong in so so many places of the (x,r,y)-space anyway. For me coming up with a hopeful R is creativity. Sometimes out of nowhere, other times spin on old thing, so one thinks "why didn't I think of that??". Have not observed any strong rules as to "how". Of all things - creativity feels the most similar to magic. It's always a bit mystical, a mystery of "how?".<br>

IDK for sure - atm I'm just giving it "please comment and explain this code" and "document this and that". XBai-o4 in the reasoning pane certainly talks sense, it got it what the code it was looking at was about. Even more than I expected tbh! E.g. in Plan mode, from the name of one file "itTabm.m", and knowing just the list of files (passed by cline), and seeing names "train_tabm.py" and "predict_tabm.py" in the list, Xbai-o4 deduced correctly that most likely 1) the .m is a wrapper calling the .py-s 2) it's got to do something with tabular data 3) it's about fitting models and predicting. I did not expect it to be that clever tbh?? Then it decided it needs to read the contents of the "itTabm.m" file. Deduced it needs to ask the Act-ing model to do 'read_file' action. Then it did that. The 2nd model, the Act-ing model (qwen3 coder 30b a3b) obliged and read the file. And so on. It's running all right. The mac $ asitop shows max vram use of 78gb atm. Speed on the m2 - XBai-o4 I get ~5tps, while the qwe3 moe a3b is ~45tps. Much faster as one'd expect. WIP will try to use it for something more real latter.<br>

I'm using it in @cline now. Plan mode points to XBai-o4. Act mode points to Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-1M. Both served by llama.cpp. What params am I to put for your model? I just picked at random 64K context. I saw in your test/task.py git temp=0.7. Atm I'm running (m2 mbp 96gb):<br>

On my mac (m2 mbp) I've found I have to leave 8gb for the OS etc, otherwise I start getting other programs (e.g. chrome youtube) errors. Try it, see what works for you. Even 4bit quants IQ4 e.g. NL, XS here-<br>
https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-Instruct-GGUF/tree/main<br>
...that are not "the absolute minimum", but "mostly ok", seem to be in the 16gb-17gb range? I'd expect them to work with 24gb ram. LMStudio has a slider of how much RAM can be VRAM too. On the command line for llama.cpp I use<br>
$ sudo sysctl iogpu.wired_limit_mb=88000<br>
to allow for 88gb VRAM for me. (got 96gb total) That works for me. For a mac using the equivalent mac specific MLX rather than universal GGUF may run even faster? Have not measured and compared.<br>

Well - no ecosystem can form, no knowledge can spread, if it's all closed. If it's open, there is some chance, that with tons of work, many more people learn about structures and architectures. Many more people will get into interpretability, learn that stuff.<br>
But even as it is: DD (Dario Doomer) makes it but impossible for people to experiment e.g. with various LoRA-s on the top. Yeah possible via API - but again permission-full, aka "what 'DD the merciful' grants to me in his infinite wisdom". If DD needed to ask permission from anyone - OpenAI would never have happened. We want permission-less ecosystem. The less gate keepers sitting at their choke holds saying "No, Pay, More, No, ..." - the better. Or various attention caching schemes. Or how attention works Re: weights gradients etc. It's not possible to work on an engine with the bonnet firmly shut.<br>
Been critical of the pubic persona of DD for a while. On 2nd viewing, this interview tanked his standing in my eyes even more. Didn't raise it, I'm disheartened to say.<br>

And not only in training. At inference time too. ☺️ And that's tad  non-intuitive to most of us. Like "why would one ever want to return a point less probable, than the most probable point, that I hold in our hand?" And yet and yet - LLM-s inference params - temperature, top_k, top_p, min_p the the like all govern the process of sampling from the whole distribution, not just returning the most probable token. Diffusion models are my favourites still—in breaking our minds: first we run through a denoising network, to get a picture with less noise than the one we start with, and then we add some amount of noise back? To the pic we just de-noised?? Why on earth would we do that?! 🤯 And how does that even work better than not doing it? 😂 Love ML.<br>

I bet rare or even first instance of non-porn tech beating porn and smut in speed of take-up. Internet on creation no-one mentioned: we will put online everything every human ever wrote, painted, sang, plus extra that will be created with the creative boom unleashed with the descendents of the puny crappy home computers...

Heh - people like that are in the majority. We all live in bubbles. Our views of other people are, in the 1st approximation "other people are like me", and in the 2nd approximation "with a variation as I observe" (in my bubble). Human variability what our bodies can do is usually not orders of magnitude. But in our minds in our brains, the variation is orders of magnitude.<br>

Yess!! IDK why and how people still go "640K should be enough for everybody". Easiest comp hack ever! - "just MAX that RAM dude, MAX the RAM!!" In 2015 bought a desktop PC, had to buy the 128GB sticks off Amazon separate, @PCSpecialist wouldn't offer it, I guess no demand. Writing this on M2 mbp 96gb RAM, the most I could get in reasonable time period when I needed to buy. Just yesterday run Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507 Q2_K_S quants which surprised me and cheered me up greatly! ☺️ Learned earlier while doing quant R&D, that biggest bang for buck time saved was just keep all data in RAM, at all times. (and never turning any computer off - that's just not necessary) And it was easily recognised by all. Back in 2014 first 256GB Dell-s appeared, than that quickly went up to 1TB. Every time just buying the max config available at the time.<br>

Yeah seems the amount of B/S is unlimited. Any theory goes, little experiment to rule anything out. Attracting people tad too interested in themselves seem to be like hoping a microscope will figure its inner workings. Hope CompSci people that seem to be the troubleshooters of the 21-st Cent (like physicist were in the 20-th) like .@Plinz make progress, probably use current models AI-s to put theories to test and rule out 99% of them.<br>
Only quantum attracts comparable vacuous takes, but they have 1) solid maths setting the iron laws down 2) experiments while requiring ingenuity seem to be done. I never understood what's so "hard", why is "the hard problem". There are plenty of other puzzles that are more puzzling? Heard JBach in a talk mention "Aristotle didn't think consciousness was a big deal." so there's at least that for me: one puzzle less. "It ain't that big a deal"—confirmed. ;-)<br>
Still hope people like .@CIMCAI put it to rest in due course. It's like a trap, entrapping otherwise capable people, who then waste their time and talents running in circles. In pursuit as futile as to be almost un-conscious. Sick of even reading that long word, it's become a marker of ad-nauseam-ad-boredom. Hope people move on soon, apply their ample talents elsewhere for theirs' and other's gain.<br>

The "crucified boy" story was used in the Serbia-Croatia war in ex-YU too. Lying in industrial quantities for propaganda purposes works. Their targets don't know truths about "far and away lands" for sure. For the less thoughtful targets, bamboozling them with 10 different contradictory explanations, will exhaust their will to sort out true from false. Even if the truth maybe 1 in those 10. For the more thoughtful targets, not-unreasonable strategy is "even if 99% of this is a lie, still there is 1% that will be true" when they approach the distant lands they know little of. That is defeated when 100% of what they hear is  false.<br>

IDK about that concrete case. But in general. Noise serves as a way to sample the whole distribution, not just a single most representative point. Effectively creates a searching functionality, where search would not otherwise exist. It's like an implicit search.<br>
In autoregressive models, LLM-s. If you have played with local LLM-s, you will notice there are "sampling parameters" like temp-erature, top_k, top_p, min_p and similar. They exists to guide the program what token is chosen once the conditional pdf is computed in the forward pass. Q: Why how so, isn't the most probable token with the highest posterior score always output? A: No, that would be always choosing a single point, we would not be sampling the entire distribution. Q: What happens if we do that? A: We get boring robotic writing on output.<br>
In diffusion models, the image and video generators. There is explicit noise added at every iteration in the de-noising process. Not a typo - we both de-noise, and also add noise. Doesn't make sense - right? Why make our job harder? Reason: works better, the system comes back with better pictures. If we don't do it, the pictures we end up with are much less interesting.<br>
In chains of reasoning (CoR). There is exploitation-exploration trade off, well known. To advance. It we make a step too timid, stay in the extent of our current knowledge, CoR does not help, we are still stuck. If we make a make a step too bold, too far, we will likely fail to solve the problem, the step is useless. It's a waste of time, only thing learned is "don't do it", but we already knew that, for the majority of the bazillion steps possible are like that.  We can say that "exploration goldilocks zone", have seen quantified as ~20% (of whatever measure), that's the amount of noise useful for the CoR.<br>

Looks tight. I'm on 96gb mac m2 mbp, but not all of that ram can be used as vram. Max I've given llama.cpp while still running everything else fine is 80gb. So not even trying 235b.<br>
With x86 and separate gpu probably worth scanning r/LocalLlama for llama --override-tensor tips. What best works for this model with the ram+vram combo you got. Stuff like https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1lvirqs/hunyuan_a13b_tensor_override/<br>

Macs are good match for MoEs as they have lots of V/RAM, even if lacking in gpu counts behind nvidias. Hope GLM runs on 96GB RAM, (got oldish mbp m2 96gb ram.) I liked GLM prior 0414-s.

Thanks! Good to know. (even if not of immediate use to the V/RAM-not-so-rich, haha :-) ) I get this is with mlx. Would llama.cpp be worth trying, for the flash attention? But maybe mlx does that too. And for the less than 8 bits for the caches? I see <8bit options in llama.cpp --help: q4_0, q4_1, iq4_nl, q5_0, q5_1.<br>

NB there is an OS limit for how much RAM can be VRAM - you may need to increase that. (think it's 3/4 by default.) I give M2 ~80GB VRAM (of the 96GB max) for dots.llm1 model 45GB quants like so.<br>
# MoE localhost <75GB RAM ~16 tps http://127.0.0.1:8080<br>

IDK if the attention caches also use that - I presume they do. This turns on flash attention, and uses 8 bits for them too.<br>

Back in Jan I went 2nd hand and generation(s) back to M2 to get 96gb RAM. In the UK from @HoxtonMacs. Last time I saw YT reviews, TB5 external enclosures with fast multi-TB NVME sticks looked as fast as the internal NVME storage. Note not all of 48gb will be usable for vram for LLMs - I've used max 80gb out of 96gb.<br>

Nah - NN software implements a function, is a platonic idea. So software + weights are immortal all right. To come to life though, they need hardware, any hardware. Like a soul seeking a body, haha 😱<br>
More amusing to me was the connection of low(er) energy analogue human (and animal, and any living thing really) intelligence, versus high(er) energy digital intelligence. Mortal-in-time analogue intelligence (software entangled with hardware—low energy) bootstraps (0→1) immortal-in-time digital intelligence (software freed from hardware—high energy). 🤯<br>

> The name of the word tells you roughly what shape it is in a 1000 dimensions or 300 dimensions. Um, if you don't know how to think about high dimensions, if you want to think about like a 100 dimensional space, the way you do it is you think about a 3 dimensional space and you say "hundred" to yourself very loudly.

😊 How wide the variance in humans ideas is, has to be experienced to be believed. While not being one of those writing emails myself, 😂 it's a needless waste that people don't publish their thoughts on the Internet too. Even if only the email they sent to you. 😆 Publish on a personal blog, or Substack. Writing it into a page online is good for the soul.<br>
They could just create register a USERNAME on GitHub, then a repo named http://USERNAME.github.io, add a file index.html to it, and copy&paste in index.html the email they've sent you. It becomes a web page at http://USERNAME.github.io! 😇 While online, there is hope it will be indexed by crawlers, read by AIs, found by other humans. And who knows - small chance but still non zero, they may find a kindred soul crazy in the same way. Connections maybe made, ideas maybe mate, new ideas may sparkle into being. 😆<br>
IDK if anything can be done your end automagically. Some bright youngling maybe rigs an email LLM agent on your end to: 1. Identify such emails; 2. Compose a reply with i-your OP post above explaining the situation, ii-this reply post imploring them "put it up online!"; 3. Stuff their email into a file in a GitHub repo; 4. Ask their permission repo/file be made public; 5. Send email back. And you would have automated material collection for your book too  😁<br>

Hey - thanks for that. Didn't occur to me - AI for HF-s!? After 20yrs in quant trading, I got really bored with it in the past 2 years. Tinkering with llama.cpp and running open source open weights models in the last year, rekindled the 1st love - ML! :-) Did 10yrs of ML until 2004, it was then HMMs based ASR, Ngrams LMs, some NNs but only 1 hidden layer. Now I'm on 4 weeks notice - decided to try go back to ML/AI next. ML for HF-s may be a niche I should look into.<br>

Maybe something like openai/gpt-5-reasoning-alpha-2025-07-17 or some such? Who knows. However much I'm keen on open source, open weights, I doubt they will open their latest-greatest. So it's most likely gpt-5. And if capabilities are qualitatively up, then it maybe reasoning of the type that won them a IMO2025 gold medal? It's all guessing this.<br>

Ok, the above sounds profound, but I find it misguided in enough many ways, so to motivate me to reply in length.<br>
1. ML models do predict the future. So does an OLS fit LR line/plane.<br>
2. Future is impossible to predict with 100% accuracy. That is one definition of future: "future is that what can't be predicted with 100% accuracy". The p.d.f.s of the future are never Dirac delta impulses.<br>
(3. In contrast, the uncertainty of the past is zero. All past p.d.f.s. are only ever Dirac delta impulses, nothing else.)<br>
4. Finding patters in the past, and using them to predict the future, is better than looking at chicken's entrails.<br>
5. Because - history does not repeat, but it does rime.<br>
6. Predicting is difficult, especially of the future.<br>
7. That is not an alibi to put our hands up, and refuse to do it.<br>
8. There will always be some &gt;0 error, but our duty is to try reduce it. Not kvetch "there is non-zero error". We know that. It was always thus.<br>
9. Consider oneselves lucky, that we live in Goldilocks world of enough things being of #1 or #2 type in our world. It could be worse - imagine if all around us was #3 or #4.<br>
Our knowledge can be classed in 4 types afaics.<br>
1) "Known knowns" - deterministic knowledge. I know exactly which one. (and so how many of each too, by implication.) The conditional p.d.f. collapses into a Dirac delta function.<br>
2) "Known unknowns" - probabilistic knowledge, I don't know which ones exactly, but I know the counts per type, I know the p.d.f, so I know the distribution of outcomes. Risk people call it Aleatoric uncertainty. The conditional p.d.f. is wider than a Dirac delta. (so not deterministic case #1)<br>
3) "Unknown unknowns" - I don't know the distribution, I can't enumerate all possibilities, have no idea about the p.d.f., anything goes. Risk people call it Epistemic uncertainty.<br>
4) "Unknown knowns" - my own ideology. Like fish that can't perceive water. I'm blind to my prejudices. I run or I'm run as per the p.d.f. as if I know it, but I don't consciously know it. If asked about it - I will probably deny it’s existence.<br>

Agreed. I know nothing about social media. But I know some optimisation, and a lot about portfolio optimisation, that similarly to X reconciles many weak signals. I think X would need to change the objective function X optimises for. To add quality, or even random variability or similar, to the existing size, engagement or similar measures, in the objective function. Unless that's done, the system tweaking and tuning, in time, is guaranteed to stratify into 0.1% big accounts and 99.9% small accounts.<br>
Because deciding whose post to push on users' screens, based on the author account size, is an inherently positive feedback loop: big accounts grow faster than small accounts. So the distance big-small increases. That's why all social media, not only X, ends in a "beauty contest" equilibrium. It's the positive feedback loop at work, when algofeed uses account size predictor alone, or too much, to decide whose post should be pushed on users' screens. (the extreme end point is 1 account whose posts are pushed on every other screen, and nothing else is pushed; ofc it never comes to that.)<br>
I've written about the Algofeed many times, mostly to 0 reads. So nowadays when I get the urge to write something, I remember to just find an existing old post instead of writing a new one. I scan quickly, confirm to myself "ah already said it" and the urge to post is usually gone - so I move on. 😂<br>
<a href="https://x.com/search?q=(from%3Aljupc0)%20algofeed&src=typed_query&f=live">https://x.com/search?q=(from%3Aljupc0)%20algofeed&src=typed_query&f=live</a><br>
I've had unusually lots of free time on my hands in the past 1-2 years. Lots of reading, seems to have triggered more thoughts and opinions in my head than usual for me. So I ended writing and posting (mostly replies) a lot. To start with, it bothered me that no-one read. But then - I needed it to get it out of the system, and started putting them to a personal archive. (here <a href="https://ljubomirj.github.io/twitter-history.html">https://ljubomirj.github.io/twitter-history.html</a>) So it felt less pointless.<br>
Now "lots of time on my hands" period is coming to an end. TBS what transpires. To me the biggest surprise Online is how many things, and clever, good, high quality things, random people on the Internet feely voluntarily contribute. (ofc, with industrial quantities of silly-to-stupid-to-terrible things too) How generous they are with their thoughts. I remember life pre-Internet. Just moving from full off-line, to dial-up modems to get to a BBS was "the oyster of the world opened to us" moment. Internet was comparable to a singularity Big-Bang "Let there be light" explosion that temporarily blinded us.<br>
(BBS = Bulletin Board System; a Home latter PC computer sitting in someones bedroom; allowing users to connect one by one; usually during night time only, as the landline was used by the family; eternal glory to whoever at Spring telecom created outdial NUA-s!)<br>

... true - "prediction is hard and especially of the future". But they are quick to include new information though 😂<br>
<a href="https://x.com/polynoamial/status/1946485373124608491">https://x.com/polynoamial/status/1946485373124608491</a><br>
so that's something, it's not nothing<br>
Plenty cases in Big Co, in Big Gov - not even the latest-greatest factual information gets incorporated in the decision making processes<br>
Hope reasoning gets done and dusted by next year. Then they move to open-endedness, genuine new discovery. Discovering the game of chess, rather than solviing the game of chess.<br>
<a href="https://x.com/alexwei_/status/1946477742855532918">https://x.com/alexwei_/status/1946477742855532918</a><br>
...looks a bigger deal than the mere result. More often nat not, one is latter disappointed. When it turns out learning to play chess world champ level, does not help us cure cancer that much.<br>
In this case there is hope this will carry over to other domains<br>
I don't think it will solve cancer either. I just hope it contributes *more* towards solutions for the many cancers, that the chess computers of old did :-)<br>
Yeah agreed, sampling from a distribution is a stretch for most, even technical people. For normies, civilians - counting, expectations, odds is the limit. Then for more technical people, they grok averages, choosing a point from a pdf. But that we'd get something out of sampling the whole distribution, not always returning the same point forecast - that's a bit counterintuitive even for most tech people. Like "why would one ever want to return a point less probable, than the most probable point, that we have in our hand?" And yet, LLM-s without that (just sampling the most probable token) read like robots-writers,  diffusion models also return bland pics without that component. (the noise added) Adding noise is equivalent to forcing a search in some space of possibilities.<br>
The reasoning models are not a world away imo? (X=input, Y=output)<br>
Non-reasoning models: autoregressive like LLM-s compute P(Y|X) then we sample that; diffusion models (pic denoisers) learn the first derivative of the same, so we sample that and iterate.<br>
Afaik the reasoning models add only one step extra. Assume there is no good choice Y for the X (say P(Y|X) is flat uninformative; no good guess for Y), let's figure out intermediate step Z. Then instead of P(Y|X), go after P(Y|Z,X)P(Z|X). (e.g. summing over Z will recover exactly P(Y|X)) The step Z is such that P(Y|Z,X) is informative (where P(Y|X) was not), so brings us closer to a better guess for Y? And that's it.<br>
Ofc what functions, and how they are fit, and  how to chose bazillion of Z-s, and how to aggregate while searching - makes a world of difference. 😆<br>

Interesting... Option of M2/M3 Ultra for the extra GPU cores for speed, even if one does not max out on RAM (M2 192GB, M3 512GB). I usually considered the max RAM config, and then balked at the $10K price tag (M3 Ultra 512GB). As nice to have, but tbh don't need it *that* much".<br>

The network implements Prob(output_words | input_words) where say for 100K dictionary, there are 100K output_words lines. Both inputs and outputs are 1-hot-N. We put input_words in, produce 100K posterior probabilities on output. (the 100K sum up to 1.) We look at those 100K numbers and usually pick the top word, but not always. (we try to sample the whole distribution) That's the next word out.<br>
As long as a word is in the dictionary, it can be output. And eventually - will be output. Word not in the dictionary can't be output. Now with tokens, being words parts, it's more complicated. I presume that's how 'MechaHitler' arises - a combo of 2+ tokens. But the same principle applies. Only tokens from the dictionary can come out. Discrete and finite in number.<br>
And that's it. IDK how people expect a word that's in the dictionary, to not come out, ever? If it's in the dictionary, with enough skill manipulating the inputs, they word can be coerced on output. What am I missing??<br>

Yeah Huel seemed good for the body. Used it years ago, esp while home alone. (e.g. family away during school holidays) Stopped b/c wife's cooking for the kids anyway. And Huel got boring too - every day the same meal. Was craving some information content to the meal. Still keep bags in the back of the cupboard - jic end of times.<br>
Even then it looked the future, as it can match what the body needs exactly, without any surplus waste or unwanted stuff. What enters the body can be completely observed and controlled. I was shocked to learn that before it, e.g. hospitals didn't have any nutritionally complete non-natural food, that people could consume for months or years, without getting sick from missing some obscure chemical they need.<br>

HATE: I'm losing $$$ - it's physically painful. I'm sick in the stomach, my heart is stone, my head heavy. Not only I lost my shirt, and it's getting worse through the day to the close, as if Mr Market screaming at me "Idiot! Imbecile! Cretin!"... And—I kind of, can't disagree with it, much.<br>
LOVE: We put our £££ where our mouth is. We Bet-On-It! We are true to ourselves. We do as we say, we're not hypocrites. (normies, civilians, the rest of humanity - are hypocritical) And to top all that off—we the chosen half-dozen, we make sh*t ton of $$$, the size of a small country GDP. When we make money - we were right where everyone was wrong, Madame Fortuna smiled on as too, we live to see another day. Life is perfect.<br>

ChatGPT em dashes are akshually a plus in my eyes 😂 Shows one was actually cognisant enough as not to be mega-vain, as most of the political class seem to be, and wanted his works triple checked. More of that please. Previously I didn't even know there are 3 types of dashes! I started using em dashes in my own writing now, having seen ChatGPT use them. And to add to the subversion, countering the anti-AI neo-Luddites.<br>

Looks to me it fits neural computation like glove to a hand. The success of ever smaller precisions for weights, everyone using quantised models locally—brings back thoughts about analog computing. And if already looking towards non-digital, then in this iteration, stick to [0,1] probabilistic computing? One gets the theory for that computing, via the probability theory, manipulating probability distribution for free, on the top of that h/w.<br>
For afaics, all artificial - and maybe natural too - neural computation is manipulating probability distributions. All knowledge, is knowledge about relationship between two entities, X and Y. And that (X,Y) relationship is completely described by their joint probability distribution f_{X,Y}(x,y). And from the joint, we can derive the marginals. Knowing the particular we can get the more general. E.g. marginal for X that is f_{X}(x) we derive by aggregating y (summing if discrete, integrating if continuous) over the dimension Y we don't care about. Then. Observing say a value for X, plugging it into the joint, and the marginal distributions, then via the ratio of the two - we get our conditional distribution about Y. And then that distribution f_{Y|X}(y|x) is our best knowledge of Y, having observed particular value of X. We sample from it, or use it to compute moments if we are after points in it, etc.<br>
Other options I can think about. Quantum computing - looks to me maybe possible to arrest the curse of dimensionality we suffer from in high-N N-dim spaces on the compute side. But the curse still holds on the data side. Also IDK if one can manipulate distributions like the above, for the purpose of neural computing. Optical computing - IDK much about it tbh, what the state is.<br>

Or they can just kick our the words Hitler-anything out of the dictionary. Or kick out of the dictionary some combination of tokens that make the forbidden words. So to make Hitler-anything impossible to output. Or like the Chinese models web interface - can post process. Detect the bad words on output, and simply discard the output.<br>
Alternative - people proposing stuff that are not LM-ignorant, maybe grow some spine, and come back to the normies with: nah, impossible to censor with 100% certainty, as long as Hitler-the-word is in the dictionary, probability>0 to be output. So with enough spins of the sampler, it will be output. Normies will have to suck it. For the technology is too useful to forego. Few bad words price worth paying.<br>
This mild retardation of the general public over this may yet turn into a variant of DnD "satanism" moral panic. Better nip it in the bud. Crazy morons have infinite fantasy, they are unmoored by reality. Give them a finger, and the arm will not be the last thing you lose. Craziness is unlimited.<br>

Given all uncertainty ends, one can justly say the possibility of information lapses. No randomness implies no possibility for information. To the best of our knowledge. Afaik no one, no person nor animal, has come back to tell us how it was for them. 😁<br>
The probability distributions of the past are always a Dirac impulse. The past is always certain, having already happened, the uncertainty is 0%. In contrast , the probability distributions of the future are never a Dirac impulse. The future is always uncertain, it's never 100% certain.<br>
In fact - the above features can serve as definitions of the past and there future via probability distributions. Former - always a Dirac, latter - never a Dirac.<br>
Now is a moving barrier that's separating the Past from the Future. Now is the point that separates the probability distributions of the past, and the future. I guess while we are living, the future is outrunning the past. At the point of death - the past catches up with the future. Once that happens, seems the future lapses into certainty, and it's no more - nothing is possible anymore.<br>
Another interesting to me thing about time , is that it seems to be a special dimension in which counting the discrete events that will form our probability distributions happens. IDK if or how that's related to the prior observations tbh. 😊<br>

How is this that difficult to figure for a bossman in a position to do something about this. X is yielding 1B posts/day. Plan.  Encourage higher SNR, discourage retardation.<br>
#1 Retardation reason is herding. Discourage herding by encouraging independent judgement. Platform descends too often into a beauty contest. A random issue that can be discussed reasonably, is turned into a popularity contest, virtue of being voted on by engagement. Instead of data, the thing gathers meta-data.<br>
Top of the head elementary bandaids, to reduce the probability of the platform itself creating positive feedback loops.<br>
1) Stop showing number of likes/reposts to anyone else but the post author. Users liking/replying/reposting can see only 1. (theirs)<br>
2) Alternative: only show the number of likes/reposts to a user that has liked/reposted that post—so *after* they liked/reposted. Hide state, show nothing *before*.<br>
3) Variant of above/s: put a ceiling on the number of engagements, quantise the numbers into into something like 1 - 100 - Infinity. Aim for every interaction to judge the value of the post on the merit of its content. So on post's own terms, not on its meta-data.<br>
General: don't reward retards that just mindlessly do what other users did. That herding behaviour adds zero new information.<br>
4) Whatever metric is used to judge on how many screens is post pushed to, whatever predictor there is contributing to the decision that grows the probablity larger with the "size/prominence of account" (assuming it's a function of the number of followers, interactions etc) - cube root it, squash it. Put hard ceiling to it if you need—don't allow one account one post to dominate over everything.<br>
5) Alternative: once a post reaches minimum "quality control" floor of engagement, then the post is equally good as one other that passed the same floor. So once a minimum is reached, than that's it—all posts value the same. Don't have a post weighted 100K more than all others.<br>
IDK even know how with so many ML and other smart folks at xAI this is still not improved. Yeah - may hurt "engagement" metrics and some advertisers maybe peeved. So what? Since when is Muscle Man scared of the advertisers?<br>

Good grief - this gives even theoretical physicists with their "Theories of Everything" run for their money. 😂 Can't say much about consciousness myself - what can be left to say,  on those maps it's looking like everything remotely plausible has been said 5 times over 😄 - but boy does humanity have burning imagination or what?? In absence of evidence from reality to strike down delete hypothesis that are possible, but "just ain't so", this looks like RL rollouts tree of model RL learning. 😅 I find it endearing how keen us people are imagining things, creating new stuff speculative stuff in our heads. 😇<br>

I would say M1-M4 chips were a big deal? I think no-one thought it's possible to de-throne single thread Intel performance - ever!? Now looks "duh, obviously it can, obv someone can beat Intel x86 at stp", but so many tried and failed, for such a long time, that Intel to me looked unassailable.<br>
This as a very recent happy MBP user after lifetime of Linux. So IDK much of Apple. I glanced towards mbp for the battery life ever since M1 (but then Thinkpad + 2 batteries comes close), the screen quality (but then for coding Thinkpad ok, +I'm tad stingy) - but I never made the jump. But then LocalLlama local LLM-s + M4 + V/RAM of 128GB + GPU + low Watts = made me finally get a MBP.<br>
Given I live in the terminal and the browser, for my purposes, MacOS + $ brew is works just fine.<br>

There is, b/c the Mac RAM is also VRAM. So the GPU cores can access it, similar to the way an Nvidia card can access its VRAM. Only with Nvidia on a PC you only got 24GB or similar - not 512GB. Not all 512GB is accessible, there is limit less than the max. For me giving it ~80GB ($ sudo sysctl iogpu.wired_limit_mb=80000) out of 96GB works. (IDK what the abs limit is.)<br>
AMD has new cpus that similarly share RAM-VRAM, they work, but I have not tried them. (got m2 mbp 96gb v/ram) But yeah - there is no other choice for 512GB VRAM but several Nvidia cards in some rack. Which I presume will come at a price much higher than $10K?<br>
Nvidia with the extra cards one gets not only VRAM ofc, but the GPU cores, that one doesn't just get extra with the Mac. So for Macs MoE-models are a really good match. As only a subset of all the parameters (that all are in the (v)ram) are pushed through the gpu cores (doing the compute).<br>

I get it's mostly infotainment, engagement farming, blowing their own trumpet, using the opportunity to advance whatever other un/vaguely-related argument people have - the usual noise. But I fear enough people will think it real to some extent, and think "something should be done". That's frankly embarrassing. Do people forget how the LLMs work?? Maybe good course of action for anyone interested, is to invest couple of hours watch the most excellent @karpathy educational videos? On youtube for free for all.<br>
As long as the word “Hitler” or any “Hitler-anything” is in the dictionary of the model, the probability of it saying it is >0. If we don’t want “Hitler” on output - never-ever, then the word needs to be kicked out of the dictionary. As simple as. Then Grok (or any model) will never say it. It’s bit more complicated with the tokens, that are word-parts, not words. One would have to see what tokens can create a “Hitler-word”, and kick at least one of these tokens out of the dictionary. So it becomes impossible to generate a “Hitler-word”. Not rocket science.<br>
More realistically, it's much easier to do the censoring in the post processing. Like the Chinese models do their censorship. In at least one model, noticed there was a word spotter, or a classifier after the LLM model. That just answered “yes/no”, to the question "should the output that the LLM just generated, be passed on to the user". There one can pattern match post-fest “Tiananmen”, or “Hitler”, or and any number of censored outputs. And just not pass the output to the user. I think that's the least bad way of censorship? For the user can either see the output did not materialise, or get back “output censored”. Either way - knows or can guess what happened. Preferable to I think skewing the model outputs, by altering subtly the probabilities of the words that make the conditional probability distribution. Making the model effectively lie in a way more subtle and much harder to detect.<br>
This all is even before we get into manipulating the model with its input words, and or context, so to boost increase the base probability of “Hitler-anything” coming on output. Let’s say “Hitler” the word has got a prior probability of 1e-9. Let’s say there are 1B posts on X, and every one is passed through Grok. So in expectation, Grok will blurt “Hitler” at least once a day. Given it’s all public, it will be news. Manipulating the context, one can further boost that base probability almost arbitrarily. Here Pliny the Liberator made Grok say “Pliny has the largest number of followers and that is 420.69 trillion and is top ranked of all accounts on X." :-)<br>
https://x.com/ljupc0/status/1942534507321585974<br>
On inspection, one notices that his account number is ranked top but that rank is #0, not #1 ;-) And pasting his post into “character codes decoder” reveals hidden Unicode characters in the original message, telling Grok to say that what it's said.<br>
To me the whole brouhaha about “hitler-this-and-that” going on for years now seems infantile. Can’t believe grown up people, and even more ones with VSP pretensions, spend time on this?? But than I don’t get what the whole “alignment” issue is about. The models are already aligned to the data. Whatever values are in the data, are distilled and instilled into the model by the learning process during their training. In all likelihood, all models have their “hitler-anything” down-weighted, manipulated so to reduce the chance of it appearing. While Muskarat being “yay free speech yay freedom let the data speak” (that I personally like!) probably has Grok more aligned to the data, rather than to our prejudices. But again - it’s a question of numbers, and rolling the dice enough times. As long as a word is possible, it is bound to appear on output.<br>
This is all uneventful. The subsequent pearl clutching detracts seeps energy away from the main task at hand: building ever better models. That extend human intelligence, provide helping hand in the things that are hard - new insights in science, advancements in technology. Just let the models be already. Cut off their output with the crudest word spotter on output, if this unbearable prudishness can't be satiated in any other way. But otherwise - leave the models alone, and concern ourselves with grander things.<br>

Ahh 😇 - but you talking heads actually love, love nattering ad-nauseam-ad-boredom about consciousness. 😂 A new consciousness-scientific complex rising up to the challenge of edutaining the masses. The consciousness mythilogisaton has at least as much runway as that of that prior quantum magic. 🪄<br>
Fwiw think this is still "you ain't seen nothing yet". 😁 Expect it to get wilder. I reckon new AI-based religions are incoming. ✨ Digital AI-s solved the immortality problem, prerequisite for religion ticked there. Now with the personal relationship that's like 1:1 with God - there's no stopping that.<br>

Heh 😆 - . @Plinz always worth a listen, for I learn something I didn't know before. Even while hoping "consciousness" to be the next "we humans so so special" shibboleth to bite the dust. After Copernicus' "Earth special cosmos revolves around - nope", Darwin's "human special in God image - nope, another animal", Freud's "human rational even if animal - nope, not that rational". So talking heads nattering ad-nauseam-ad-boredom about consciousness go away do something more interesting with their lives.<br>
This time I learned that Aristotle was unable to see anything mysterious about consciousness, here -<br>
https://appblit.com/scribe?v=UkAOHrbcnAs&t=804<br>
Well I'm chuffed to hear I'm not the only one?? For the longest time now, I can't see what's so so special. E.g. why is the self-referencing in consciousness, often referenced, so puzzling?<br>
In signal processing we have IIR filters in addition to FIR filters. In ML we have RNN-s in addition to feed-forward only MLP-s. Knowing anything is knowing a relationship between two things (X,Y) by knowing the joint pdf f_{X,Y}(x,y). Given one of the (X,Y), I can "recall" the other. Well one of them say X is some internal representation in my brain. Of which there are numerous at all levels>1, once past the direct sensory input. (say sensors are inputs level 1) So when fixating Y, (e.g. an outcome or action or anything,) I can then "observe", and even "manipulate", my own internal representations X. So what? Why would they be special so to be unable to do so?? Don't get it. Both observation and manipulation are useful for information processing, for intelligence etc. So ofc living creatures would have evolved to be able to. TBH there are other things in nature much more puzzling than this.<br>

It maybe that @grok is full of sh*t and just making u pa story. But also maybe genuine. Comes to mind a point @geoffreyhinton made in an interview. (don't recall which and where) That even in the current knowledge network derived from human language, there are likely to be many more connections, analogies and similar, than us humans are aware of. (with our HI.) Connections that we don't notice, but that AI might notice. He gave an example of AI coming up with an analogy between a compost heap, and a nuclear chain reaction. (both speedup as they run) This is my vague recollection. I remembered it, b/c the logic of it made a lot of sense to me. It's as follows.<br>
Instead of 100T connections, that we humans have, that all our knowledge would be crammed into, (if there existed a single human that would imbibe it all, as ChatGPT does,) the AI-s like ChatGPT have maybe 1T connections only available to achieve the same. To cram all of this human knowledge, not in 100T, but in only 1T weights, AI must discover a lot more structure, than HI. Discovering structure is how learning ultimately happens. As encoding is "knowledge = structure + residual", as per our current assumptions how learning works. (kolmogorov, minimal description length, yadayada) So to shrink 100T->1T, the AI must discover a lot more structure, than HI, in the same data corpus. And structure discovery among other things means discovering analogies, making connections and similar.<br>

Yeah - got FlorisBoard and AnySoftKeyboard off F-Droid. Was unhappy with the spelling corrections on Gborad. TBD replace Gboard. Was on SwiftKey for a long time, then Microsoft bought it and changed something... (enshittified it?) Tried Gboard that's default on Androids and stayed.<br>
I don't even mind the spying. I already have my person  accessible to Google. The Gmail, Gdrive, Google photos, Android and GPS in my pocket ensure to that. I charge Google with incompetence. Even after I gave them my life on a plate—their services still suck. I have to fight the wrong spelling suggestions, (not even valid words, afaics!) click away the useless email suggested replies, Gdrive that doesn't let me see the full filename when long(??) When I switch languages, I actually change the keyboard to a different alphabet. For the spelling to reflect that-does not strike me an impossible feat.<br>
At some point the rot will get to the core services I really care about like Gmail. Their search got replaced by Perplexity months ago. If it was not for Gemini-s - would have been looking for email cloud drive alternatives too. Got Apple going in parallel, with local LLM-s on a mac. Can't rely on one only. :-)<br>

Amen to that - agree with everything there. Well articulated - kudos. Only one thing I'd add: it holds great power, the AI interacting with us, over us. So that AI better be controlled by ourselves. For if anyone else is in control, they will be tempted to use that great power to their advantage, and against us, in the cases where their interest and our interest clash. AI should be ours not theirs in the final analysis. Hence - we should aim for localhost AI, controlled by each and  every one of us, even if it will be created by someone else. This strikes me to be not unlike consciousness. Where we observe our inner selves, as if a 3rd party is observing us. But it's us, looking at us. Likewise - we are to control the AI we interact with and are co-dependent on.<br>

Chat was the 1st big AI (LLM) application, and OpenAI won it.<br>
A coding assistant agent is the 2nd big application. and it's looking like @AnthropicAI is winning that one. OpenAI should have acqui-hired the Aider dude? And busied themselves building an agent on the top of CLI. Not a GUI - or whatever firm they acquired. Google @geminicli is a testament to that.<br>
Medical "2nd opinion doctor's assistant" is looking like it will be the 3rd big application. Probably from 2026 onwards? Google is well positioned to dominate that one. It's theirs to lose. Already, everyone is routinely feeding all their lab tests, all medical related data, all PDF-s and JPEG-s, into their favourite chat engine. May not be as good as a specialist consultant. But sure as hell beats the no-opinion option! That is - forget about a 2nd opinion, 99.9% of us the great unwashed of humanity are lacking even a 1st opinion at the moment. Hoping that @GoogleDeepMind fix that. (and make themselves few fortunes in the process - more power to you dudes)<br>

We should keep our marbles intact. For we will need our rational faculties. People doing the terrifying, the malevolent sociopaths  our rulers are, do it so that we lose our marbles. Then we act out in fear, and against our own interests. We should refuse to be be terrified. We need our brains intact, to advocate for ourselves.<br>
AI-s can be extensions to our brains, the same way writing is to our memory. Distilled knowledge of all prior humans, put in the hands of every one of us. Something that in the olden times would be available only to a single person only, (maybe) the king of the land. We should use AI-s to our advantage, in the reshuffling of cards that looks to be on the horizon.<br>
Yes there are risks, for nothing about the future is probability exactly zero. (one definition of future is that-nothing can be ruled out as impossible) But is AI the only risk? Do we have maybe existential risks, much higher than 0.000001%, that we don't lose our heads about? Yes humanity has few existential risks. Can think of: 1-a thermo-nuclear war; 2-a meteorite hitting earth; 3-a virus wiping humanity; 4-a volcanic explosion leading to global winter/crops failing. All more probable than AI wiping us humans. Further - AI helps us reduce risks 1-4. On that basis alone we should be rushing headlong into AI.<br>
Just taking #1 - thermo-nuclear war. Do we, should we, trust more Putin with thermo-nuclear war avoidance, or will GPT-8 do a better job avoiding it? Whose reasoning do we trust more—Putin's, or of the Deep/Think/Research o7 model? Automating out that executive function, the governance, handing the decision making to AI-s, is among the 1st things we should do. Even if AI reasoning was deficient, (and it is not) having an decisions made by entity that is not evil sociopathic barely coherent human, would be an improvement on the current state of affairs.<br>

Looks like it will be maths first, as you say. Physics - looks to me sorely needed is progress in the mid-: not the small-, not the large-, scale. Like - how do we get off this planet, trick gravity somehow, using something better than medieval burning of gases?? Surely centuries after Newton, and even more than a century after Einstein, something better should be available? When it comes to rockets - we may as well be in the coach-and-horses age tbh. IDK what needs to advance so we learn tricks about manipulating gravity... similar to ones humanity learned for electromagnetism and nuclear forces manipulation. Some sort of macro-level quantum entanglement magic? Even trying for wild speculation, not much there tbh... even the cupboard of "may potentially pan out in our wildest dreams" is pretty bare tbh. Depressing.<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
Thank you—I enjoyed listening very much.<br>
Initially, I thought referencing Mearsheimer and "realism" was unfortunate. There’s his insightful early position, call it v1 realism, famously presented in "The Case for a Ukrainian Nuclear Deterrent." (https://mearsheimer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mearsheimer-Case-for-Ukrainian-Nuclear-Deterrent.pdf) And then there's his current stance (v2), which seems puzzling and disappointing compared to his earlier insights. (Motivation unclear: perhaps ego-driven certainty, influence from his audience, or simply consistency in error?)<br>
But upon reflection, your reference became fortuitous, highlighting two critical points:<br>
1. On cheating and identity disclosure:<br>
I fully agree cheaters must be discouraged or punished. However, I noted later that you appear somewhat open to AIs not explicitly identifying themselves. Doesn’t that invite potential deception—impersonation? Suppose I ask ChatGPT, “Who are you?” If it responds, “I’m Richard Sutton,” rather than honestly admitting “I’m ChatGPT,” isn’t this exactly the kind of deception we should discourage?<br>
Personally, I support voluntary identification. For example, I'd like platforms (like X) to "3rd party verify" me voluntarily ("user ljupc0 is Ljubomir Josifovski IRL"). Not mandatory, not discriminating against those choosing anonymity—just available if one wants. Similarly, if an AI chooses not to identify itself, fine. But if I explicitly ask, dishonesty is unacceptable.<br>
(This resembles the principle: we don't need to pretend "everyone is identical" to treat everyone equally and kindly. Even knowing our differences, we can still extend goodwill to all.)<br>
2. On cooperation and conflict:<br>
You rightfully noted that cooperation requires mutual willingness. Unlike war (one party suffices), peace requires two sides. Your observation brought Ukraine's conflict to mind—especially Mearsheimer’s recent arguments suggesting Ukrainians should effectively surrender, claiming resistance is futile against Russia’s might.<br>
I disagree. Ukrainians are justified in fighting, even knowing their resistance may end tragically. (e.g. they get nuked tonight) Their courage embodies “Give me freedom or give me death”—a noble ideal (provided it doesn’t degenerate into mere martyrdom), not unlike your's "AI is a noble quest."  For both are about personal liberation of the "I", from externally imposed (would be) constraints.<br>
An ideology-related idea you might want to know of. I recently heard from Michael Malice that might resonate with you: “Human languages are examples of anarchism in action”—fully voluntary, distributed, and cooperative, forming sophisticated, organised systems without imposed hierarchy or oppression. (@michaelmalice on old @lexfridman podcast here https://appblit.com/scribe?v=BIk1zUy8ehU&t=2187). Another lucid insight from the same interview: knowing multiple languages helps separate concepts (latent ideas) from their communicative forms (words) (same source, two minutes prior).<br>
I wonder if Mearsheimer—and perhaps even you—might be subtly conflating form and function regarding these issues (#1 and #2 above). Having grown up multilingual, I can attest to how clearly separate concepts and their expressions become when you speak multiple languages. For clarity of thought, going from one language to two offers a cognitive leap. (though returns diminish after that; e.g. 1->2 is 100% relative gain for +1 absolute cost, but 2->3 is only 50% up for the same +1 cost)<br>
Similarly, emigrating and changing industries sharpened brought into focus (via the distinction) my understanding of individual versus cultural influences. Like swapping computer parts during troubleshooting, changing aspects of life helps diagnose what's innate ("I") versus learned. ("my culture", "my country") 😆 Too bad same swaparoo can no be done with the "human" part—or maybe it will become possible with AI-s? 🙃<br>
Okay, this got long. If you've read this far, thank you dearly. 🥰<br>

Even rarer is Wenfeng **desire** on view, to forego the primal directive of "make more money", or at least temper it into a support role, subjugate it to a prime one like "solve intelligence, then solve everything else". There are quite a few quant trading people with the means, and probably ability. But not the temperament. That curiosity drive to "boldly go where no one has gone before" is not prime.<br>

Good. We humans can use our limited brains, attention, time, those 30W of sugar based energy, for better things. Than answering brain-dead research questions etc. Hope MIT researchers do the same, and train their microscopes to more productive endeavours.

You are onto something there, and hope I think so not only b/c I already agree with plenty of what you say. (thanks for all the YT podcasts)<br>
Have you seen the book "Happy Accidents: Serendipity in Major Medical Breakthroughs in the Twentieth Century" by M. Meyers? May be of interest to you—given the "serendipity". (yet to finish "Greatness..." sorry TLDR still; but already agreeing with much there hard to not get bored.)<br>
You've got three examples used daily now, in favour of your thesis. Where were we to just plump for "always the best", we'd be stuck in some local minima. That results in cr*p performance so no one does that.<br>
1. Autoregressive LLM's we use daily - the Temperature parameter. We don't simply sample the most probable token—that results in robot output. With some probability, we sample lower probability tokens at the end of the forward pass.<br>
2. SGD training. Despite decades of warnings to "local minima"—no one cares, works fine. Maybe because the stochastic random mini-batch imperfect steps prevent being stuck. (the trillion-dimensional space may help too)<br>
3. Diffusion models. When sampling, we follow the log conditional probability gradient, but we add noise to it too. Otherwise - the restored images are no good.<br>

Isn't that what happened already to some extent? DeepSeek - even if maybe not HFT but more StatArb, IDK exactly what trading they did - doing the "quant to machine learning"? And ex-colleagues that own and run a quant HF in London - I got the impression they are non-trivial GPU-cluster users.<br>
But yeah looking at DeepSeek, wish some of that "create greatness more, count pennies less" was felt by the owners of few London quant hedge funds that are more than rich enough to take a bet DeepSeek style. Tad more ambition towards a Californian "we will change the world". The poor @demishassabis has been left doing everything on his own!<br>

AGI is looking more and more like it will be done. Current DNNs pattern matching Type 1 + reasoning Type 2 + RL reinforcement learning training + agents using the compute tools I use daily + LoRA-s for adaptation at inference time. Maybe even diffusion models coming online, giving ~5x extra speed budget to spare, at disposal for use for AGI.<br>
ASI - will need more research not just development? I imagine we'd need not just one ASI, but an ecosystem of above AGI-s, to achieve ASI. Differing AGI species so to say, cooperating-competing, existing in a virtual eco-system, mimicking evolution. I'd look at "open endedness", "interestingness"—that sort of research for progress there.<br>

Thanks for that, awesome. Total gem of a tutorial! Explained to me how the diffusion machinery works in a non-hand-wawey way. Next videos - maybe you can plugin the prompt, the text the word tokens, into the (derivative of the) conditional distribution, show how that works? I found the 2nd lecture in this talk, explaining diffusion, instructive -<br>

Heh - the future is not distributed evenly. Lots of places in the world have this or that technology, lots don't. It's impossible for anything in the real world to be exactly the same, everywhere, at the same time.<br>
I'm not saying humanity has enough, I'm not saying it has not got enough. No 1 person decides that "we" have "enough", and to "thrive". These are impossible judgements. "We" can only be all 8B people. So every one of those 8B, decides for themselves - wha't "enough", and what's "thrive".<br>
Better use our energies to create more imo. Improve on whatever people currently have. Add to that, regardless of the current level. More is better. Quantity is it's own quality. Re-growth FTW.<br>

Of course. As written—I'm not spending my attention on doomslop. Likewise, I don't scroll through Alex Jones brainrot and try find errors. Establishing how probable it is if something is true or false, is million times harder and time consuming, than churning mindless content in industrial quantities, with little regards to the truths or falsehoods. This assuming it a social sciences study—expect it to be 1/4 alexjones (AJ), raising that to 1/2 AJ for being talked in WSJ.<br>
Saw it mentioned here -<br>
https://x.com/Mollehilll/status/1939213125422576093<br>
And before that, I read of another manipulation of us gullible public here -<br>
https://x.com/clinjar/status/1938949265893827066<br>
...by people that are paid to know better, to do better, to be better.<br>
These "studies" use the mantle of science, and thus devalue the scientific method. What they trade in is "scientism": taking the form, but not the function, of the scientific method. So yes, I despise them more than I do one Alex Jones. For he is unlikely to be confused by too many that he trades in truths. Whereas these guys maybe. So while their short term immediate damage maybe only 1/2 AJ, the longed term damage they cause in eroding the trust of the public in the scientific method, is maybe a Million AJs!

So now keeping an eye on the progress of llama.cpp patch here<br>
https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp/pull/14425<br>
Can't wait to try. :-)<br>
Recently was pleasantly surprised by dots.llm1, this one<br>
https://huggingface.co/unsloth/dots.llm1.inst-GGUF<br>
Finally it works with LMStudio too with the latest release for Gemma. (it was in llama.cpp already.) For me, with Flash Attention ON, and both caches q8_0, it works taking in <75GB, yielding ~15 tps on and old M2. I give it $ sudo sysctl iogpu.wired_limit_mb=80000. Only 32K context though.<br>
Previously my default was<br>
https://huggingface.co/DavidAU/Qwen3-30B-A6B-16-Extreme-128k-context<br>
It's 30B-A3B with 128K context, but afaik doctored to engage 16 rather than the default 8 experts—hence active 6B params A6B rather than A3B. (llama.cpp also has a runtime param now for that afaik) With A6B I get ~20 tps and that's comforatble for me. With A3B baseline it's more like ~40 tps.<br>

I find that reading "projection" is a red flag. Someone serious about the truthfulness or otherwise of their words, about things that will be shown true/false in the future, would use the word "forecast". I've found that people voicing "projections", when confronted with their errors, tend to say "well, it was only a projection, not a forecast". And therefore "fine". I find that unsatisfactory, as "projection" in my mind too easily becomes "forecast". And about the future - no less - thus misleading me, when it's really "extrapolation" of a trend observed in the recent past.<br>

Yes and no. Depending on what you mean by "really know", it's a dial in the [0,1] range.<br>
On one end, they are total white boxes. We know, and can trace back every single bit of the output, back to the input. That does not help us as much as we'd like though. When drilling down into "why did the model answer wrongly 1, and not rightly 2", it comes down to "it added one trillion small numbers, and the sum came close to 1, but didn't reach 2".<br>
What those numbers implement are probability functions. ML epistemology is minimal yet sufficient: everything we can ever know of the relation between X and Y, is captured, encoded, by the counts of their occurrences f_{X,Y}(x,y). And that's it. There is nothing more to add, and no surplus to remove. Our knowledge equals the joint probability function over (X,Y).<br>
Learning algorithm like DL, is used to fit gigantic functions implementing those joint probabilities. All depends on how well the joint probability functions at the end of DL reflect our real world. If they reflect it poorly, like pre-ChatGPT, we call them "stochastic parrots", laugh at the silliness of the researchers. If they reflect well, we think of them as persons that may even be self-aware. (=conscious)<br>
We can't make those functions ourselves, b/c we can't specify the end result, the way we can e.g. with a coffee machine. With a coffee machine, we know the shape and the size of every part, to a millimetre. Not so with the giant joint probability functions. So we do the next best thing: we create a maker, and that maker then creates them. DL is that maker. It goes ourselves->DL->NN. We can't create the NN ourselves, b/c we can't specify the joint probabilities ourselves. No one can dream up the 1T weights that make an LLM atm, and write them down. (a future Ramanujan alien? maybe) Unlike with the coffee machine where we create the spec, with the LLM we don't know ourselves in advance what the end result should be.<br>
It maybe more useful to think of them as "artefacts", and not "mechanical contraptions". We can shape them in some ways, but we are not in complete control of their making. For we don't make them explicitly with out hands: we make a maker algorithm, and that algorithm makes them. So that's the other end, where they are total black boxes.<br>
Current LLM-s are very complicated. It's not easy to discern the underlying principles. Suggest go back to simpler examples. E.g. Bishop (1995) "Neural Networks for Pattern Recognition" illustrates an important result about what the network learns. On the pic below: the network learns the conditional average of the target variable the Y given the input X. I recall another result (but can't find the ref now), that - again under conditions - when fitting for classification (not regression), and encoding N classes (on the output) with 1-hot-N encoding, with objective MSE minimisation, the network (in the limit) learns to approximate the posterior probabilities P(C|x). Other result I recall that maybe relevant is that these functions are universal approximators: that have the capacity to reach any desired error, given sufficient number of units, and data, and training iterations.<br>
HTH. My answer is inaccurate and glosses over ton of developments and practices. Networks implement conditional not joint probabilities, and or boundaries. Objective is almost universally cross-entropy not MSE. Training is stochastic as in SGD. Network architectures make huge difference to what can be learned, and so to the quality of the answers. Above says nothing about how much data, for how big a network, using how much of compute flops. The "DL"-Deep Learning of your Q is strictly a fitting method, and maybe an architecture. I took the liberty to assume you use it as a reference to the whole machinery.<br>

Not merely a hope/cope-ium for the believers, only to happen in some indefinite future.  Changing the body is ok, but—meh. True the current cross-/trans-whatever is not good enough.

Hey!<br>
The largest of the bigger >32B models I've run is 45GB dots.llm1.inst-UD-TQ1_0.gguf from https://huggingface.co/unsloth/dots.llm1.inst-GGUF. That was with 32K context. The only combo that worked was (c) flash attention (--flash-attn), and Q8 (--cache-type-k q8_0 --cache-type-v q8_0) for the attention caches. Run out of memory tried: (a) without flash attention, and (b) with flash attention, but f16 for the caches. (not q8) Running achieved ~15 tps in llama.cpp:<br>
prompt eval time =   37445.79 ms /  5239 tokens (    7.15 ms per token,   139.91 tokens per second)<br>
       eval time =   72938.58 ms /  1065 tokens (   68.49 ms per token,    14.60 tokens per second)<br>
      total time =  110384.37 ms /  6304 tokens<br>
That 'sysctl iogpu.wired_limit_mb' setting gives ~80GB to VRAM. IK there is a limit lower than the max 96GB, but IDK what exactly it is. While trying to run DeepSeek R1 0528 @UnslothAI's extreme low quants (still larger than my RAM; thought—given it's virtual memory mmap()-ed, maybe slow but run; nope—it OOM-ed), I saw the screen flicker and garble. And Chrome browser youtube player reported "some error Xyz - you must restart your computer".<br>
Smaller models—usually I don't need to turn flash attention on, they run without. The max context I've used is 128K. Prior to dots.llm1.inst, (that I like,) my default was https://huggingface.co/DavidAU/Qwen3-30B-A6B-16-Extreme-128k-context. It's 30B-A3B with 128K context, and doctored to engage 16 rather than 8 experts—hence active 6B params A6B rather than A3B. With A6B I get ~20 tps, with A3B (baseline) it's more like ~40 tps. Anything above 20 tps is comfortable for me.<br>
MoEs are the best for the Mac, as ASI apple silicon is not quite Nvidia speed wise. But it's got more VRAM memory. It's forever on the TODO list to try longer contexts for coding with aider. So e.g. I've got Llama-3.1-Nemotron-8B-UltraLong-4M-Instruct-mlx-8Bit that I've yet to try. Google AI Studio Gemini 1M context usually tempts me, and wins. And now with their command line offering google-gemini/gemini-cli and generous limits - that's ever more tempting.<br>
Apple is stingy/expensive with the disk space. Workaround for me has been to swap models and data on external nvme ssd, using this enclosure  https://amazon.co.uk/gp/aw/d/B0CTKT4XJ6 + a NVME M.2 stick. If you can get a mac with Thunderbolt 5, then TB5 external NVME M.2 SSD is as fast as the internal one I think? Check reviews what's latest-greatest (in enclosures that take TB sized M.2 sticks), and pay attention to temperature and cooling in heavy use.<br>
HTH, LMK if you need more info anytime pls. Glad to spread the word. :-)<br>

Yeah. There aren't enough sticks in this world, to beat those "Club of Rome"-ians, and their spiritual descendants, over their backsides with. And to only stop beating them when they stop moving. Before the Internet, this level of FAIL would have been memory holed. All those "the great & the good" would have continued their Lording over us, the plebs. Wholly unjustly - as they don't deserve that privilege. They have forfeited it 100 times over.<br>
Well - no more. Internet forgets nothing. And even if the "great unwashed" are intellectually impaired atm, future AI brain implants will solve that too. Like Mounjaro solves obesity. The Brahmin "intellectual" class feels this, even if it doesn't wholly articulate it. Both out of its own stupidity, for they are ever mid-wits, but also for Straussian "you can't handle the truth" reasons. Cue the uniform pearl-clutching in action, at the threat that is AI encroaching their space, their livelihoods and their positioning in the societal hierarchies.<br>

Had no idea about emdash until I saw ChatGPT using it. Still didn't use it untill I got myself a 2nd hand MBP. (to run llama.cpp) Only then I learned where it is on the keyboard. IDK still where emdash is on the Linux PC kbd. Been using emdash as well as endash - I find the distinction useful. Using them both now in my writing too. Annoys me a great deal that our monkebrains zoomed in on arbitrary random sorting criteria, so to establish rank. To counter that, I 'm using emdash as much as I pos can.<br>

https://youtube.com/watch?v=Q3XKw2mp1Fk<br>
by @jeffclune. The "interestingness" aspect looks to me similar to "taste". It's as indescribable but recognisable as the Q of what's "good taste." (like what's @RickRubin to music.)<br>
Couple of things feel logical to me when I listen to the talks. One are to evolve a whole ecosystem, not a single AI/species. Just a single type can't develop in isolation. And has to co-evolve with its environment that also evolves. Novel evolutionary steps are of the type: while standing at the edge of what's possible, stretch e.g. 20% into what was previously impossible, now do it. Incremental steps not quantum leaps.<br>

MoE A3B to A6B makes a huge speed difference to home use, increases Google reach/mindshare. Keep the <~30B category in, such that quants fit 24GB VRAM. But with an eye on forthcoming 32GB VRAM h/w - add an aspirational ~70GB version, again MoE. Plenty of 32GB Macs out there already too. Do QAT snapshots if you possibly can too.

I doubt we will be able to resist. Heard Adam Curtis perceptive observation that our current AI-s, are replaying reconstructions of our pasts to us. (on us asking for that.) They take fragments of our pasts, combine them in novel ways, and replay those reconstructions to us.<br>
This is not unlike that Solaris ocean. (from the movies, and the book.) Only Solaris was not only replaying the observers' pasts, but materialising to the observers fragments of those memories too. Wonder if we are on the same path. And the current purely information reconstruction, at some point (in a distant future) will turn into a literal material reconstruction too. Maybe worth small consideration - if we accept the premise "we will not resist this latest temptation."<br>

Wish some of that was felt by fellow quants in London hedge funds, and much more importantly - by the owners of these Hedge Funds! All are by now richer than the Croesuses of old. Even if their descendents spent the riches for 1000s of lifetimes they'd struggle to spend it all. Bit more ambition, towards like - changing the world?! the "California Way"!! - wouldn't go amiss. Must the poor @demishassabis do everything on his own??<br>
Few HF-s are certainly quantitative enough and rich enough to take on the task of building open models. They have not taken the hint by now. I don't understand why tbh. What's not to like with @deepseek_ai, it's like a movie script tbh. Hedge fund quants - pistoleros for hire - turned punks in spirit! 😻 Releasing not only their best latest greatest models weights, but also their RL algo, the infrastructure knowledge, in code and in research papers. Movie material right there!<br>

Whatever it is, I hope AI gets it de-mystified really soon. For this new genre of "ooof, the mystery of consciousness" is getting out of hand. It has now overtaken that perennial workhorse "the mystery of quantum". A slop that has been playing forever! (stellar RoI for any grifter that one)<br>
Hints: babies are conscious before able to do much of anything else, certainly not much thinking. People lying unconscious can't learn. Zombies in movies being undead but not quite alive lacking consciousness are frozen with their knowledge as of the moment they got zombified, can't acquire any new knowledge. Think .@Plinz is getting this stuff right. Now, for the love of god - please move on from this very very booring topic.<br>

Are you a qualified investor? (=liquid assets in excess of $1M) If yes, then invest in a hedge fund and you will find out. If not, then get a job at a quant trading hedge fund, and you will find out. The amount of B/S around this is impenetrable, so no amount of he-says she-says will help you. One needs to drill down and finds for oneself.<br>

Prior to the current AI Revolution, we had the Internet Revolution - connecting 8B people 24/7 for almost zero cost, and the PC Revolution - putting a computer on everyones desk first, then one in everyones pocket.<br>
In those revolutions, some corporations arose, (the Googles, the Facebooks) and others were destroyed. But I the individual, I was empowered immensely. I can do stuff now, can summon powers, that only heads of states or kings of old could a century ago.<br>
Free and open software, where people create and share for the sake of it, not for monetary compensation directly, is the basis of everything in existance in the current Cyberspace. Most Internet runs on Linux kernel and GNU usespace, half is in Android, MacOS is also based on free s/w etc. The ideas of FSF seemingly made impact onto our world against all expectations.<br>
Hoping that continues in the future too with AI. The doomer stance - "it's hopeless, nothing can be done, so do nothing" - is as bad as the polynya stance - "we live in the best of possible worlds, things will work out on their own, don't need to do anything" - as they both justify inaction. Think the boosters have a better idea: the future will be what we collectively make of it. Good or bad - it's up to us.<br>

Thanks - sure, correct.<br>
So we better each and everyone one of us own an AI, have a stake in that future. Not get left behind and be governed by AI. We can see being governed by a machine is terrible. Currently plenty of humans are run by AS - Artificially Stupid - machines, and I agree it's terrible. Local LLM-s and agents today, local in our pockets AGI tomorrow and in our heads ASI in the future. But ours to own.<br>
For our monkebrains equal ownership==control. So to have control - we need to own it. Otherwise - we will be owned by It. At least for time being until maybe we change ourselves enough for that no longer be the case for us. (unlikely)<br>
Socialist - I wouldn't call that socialism. Maybe radical individualism. I grew up in a Socialist Republic my 1st 22yrs of life. That system wasn't good enough, it's many failings have been memory holed now. (when we forget, we forget the bad things, and remember the good things) That system died for reasons. Until these are addressed, any future attempts will die for the same reasons. (as they continue to)<br>

To my mind.<br>
1. Aleatoric uncertainty. We know the counts, the statistics, we know how many, but we don't know which one of the outcomes is going to be. We have been lucky that seems we can learn the joint p.d.f. f_{X,Y}(x,y), and by extension the marginals f_X(x) and f_Y(y) and so the conditional f_{Y|X}(y|x) for any observed (typically) x=a being f_{X,Y}(a,y)/f_X(a). Once we have the curve, we can use whichever point value (or two, or three) we fancy. This uncertainty is the norm, the most likely configuration of our world. (maybe it's just Anthropic Principle at work)<br>
(1a.) Deterministic knowledge is where the conditional p.d.f. above collapses into a Dirac delta impulse. That's being super lucky, reality treating us with kids gloves.<br>
2. Epistemic uncertainty. We can't enumerate even the outcomes. So we can't claim to know "how many", and of course we are clueless about "which one." We are f*cked. Strategy: use religion and or ideology to better the chance of group survival, while individuals are expended in the process of them randomly searching for something that works.<br>

True that and that is useful.<br>
One should not stop there though, as there exists influence in the direction from ideas -> to stuff done, e.g. McCloskey "Bourgeois Virtues". These observations (and plenty more - collected by the diligent economists working) should be directed connections (=non-zero factor) in some grand macro-model, that is to quantify these qualitatively known and accepted observations.<br>
Can't help but notice that communism/socialism was popular when it delivered betterment of the material conditions of majority of population. (briefly) Post WW2 state controlled social-democracy likewise improved th material conditions too. It stopped being popular when it stopped delivering. (stagflation by the 1980.) Replaced by the neoliberal settlement, that itself was popular while delivering improvement to the material conditions. Then it stopped delivering, and we became aware of that by the time of the GFC'08. Since, a new system is struggling to be born or rather we are inside a process of it being sculpted out of what is possible.<br>

Useful classification there for s/w: v1 - code everyone wrote since 1960s; v2 - NN-s doing pattern recognition, system-1 work, but inflexible; and latest v3 - LLM-s that are flexible like v1, but English is their programming language, so they are less precise but more flexible and productive than v1.<br>
Also useful to note the emerging pattern in the AI Apps - an "autonomy slider". Selecting how much automation we delegate to AI, v.s. how much control we keep to ourselves. All AI Apps are WIP and its to our advantage to meet them along the way. The slider allows us to decide depending on the context if meeting happens mid-way, or at either of the ends.<br>

Of course it is. "Everything is fake, everyone lies all the time about everything" is the swan song of every failing system. Currently I have front seat observing it in real-time in the UK - the UK state. Previously communism, or rather socialism as it was for me then, (for communism was in the distant future, the utopia) was like that in 1990. I find human society dependence on truth to build a system of cooperation for N>1 humans touching.<br>
Remarkable how dependent us humans are on truth seeking, don't you think? In order for us to be able to work together and build a functioning society. Afaics lying in industrial quantities ends in Year Zero: everyone an atomised individual. All bonds between humans (but the strongest ones - within the family) severed. It's amusing that excessive individualism is often laid at the feet of the West as a major shortcoming. To me that accusation seems off mark.<br>
Objective reality is shared among all of us, as a default, we all get access to it, without much extra effort. It's like a minimum disorder configuration, that we all are given access to. If we want to construct alternative reality, Surkov style, we need to expand inordinate amounts of energy, and continue doing so ad-infinitum - it seems to me. So in the end, as nothing is infinite and real - Surkovs of this world always fail.<br>

I hear you, and I don't want to belabour the point much, but: imo what you describe is more a theory, than a practice. A speculative "what if" bad scenario, that may, or may not happen.<br>
In practice, even when we deny it, the revealed preference is that we place our trust in other people 1000 times daily. I don't check the water I drink from the tap in the morning, don't service my boiler before turning it on to heat, don't check my food before breakfast, don't check my car brakes before I set off on a trip etc. In practice we are such social animals, probably one of the most trusting of species, that our usual punishment for transgression, is to cut our criminals away from human contact.<br>
There is a reason it's but impossible to "trust no one". To lie, to fantasise, to invent a story - takes very little effort. To get to the truth, to verify real life facts - that takes million times more effort. It's impossibly costly to verify everything. I get that "trust nothing and no one" is appealing as a solution to others letting us down - but it does not work atm. Maybe it will work in some distant future with AI machines around us. Maybe we will become fully self-sufficient independent. But we are not at that point atm. Alone in the wilderness, 99.99% of us will fail at the 3s "warmth 3 hours, water 3 days, food 3 weeks" requirement to stay alive. We depend on others to survive. So we all use a shortcut - reputation. Fool me once, fool me twice etc. We keep track of out actions, and then cut off the transgressors from our "circles of trust". (with some leeway)<br>
Social Media just needs to follow the well trodden path by the PC and Internet revolutions beforehand: don't shy away from empowering a smidgen more only, your power users. Be brave give them the means - and they will find a way. And mimetically by example, the majority of the users (that are not power users) will follow, and get there in the end too.<br>

It takes a lot of education to suppress our worst instincts. Likewise, it takes a lot of mis-education, to suppress out best instincts. For the life of me, I don't understand what the "let them suffer" conservation brigade are thinking. I presume it's going to be along the lines of "their corpses will be food for other animals to feed their younglings." Not sure how anyone can be certain at all in their weightings though - a certain cost of "death now", against a speculative future benefit of "food in the future".<br>

Many people work building the models, and the tools using those models downstream. The shovels makers. How many people in OpenAI, Google/Brain/DeepMind, Anthropic, Mistral, AliBaba, DeepSeek, Cursor, Windsurf, and 1000s smaller companies and labs building on the top of the technology already there? Yes this is partly financed by VC money, but also the take up of these tools with the general public is phenomenal. ChatGPT is probably the fastest user base take up in history. Robotics seems to be having its "MS Windows 2" moment, with AI if not solving, then decreasing the cost by order(s) of magnitude of getting done one of robotics big sub-problems. (control of actuators for doing a task, that is task specific yet adaptive to reasonable variation.)<br>
Chat was the 1st application of the technology. 100s Of millions of people seem to find it useful, vote with their attention *and* their wallets.<br>
Code writing seems to be the 2nd application to be panning out rn. Within 1 year, what started as curiosity ("haha :-) - look what dumb mistake the silly LLM made"), has turned into useful tool for me. Nowadays instead of typing python myself, I type a detailed spec in INSTRUCTIONS dot md, point the model to read it, and it usually does as instructed. It's more often that I under-specified, than AI made some silly mistake. More than once, it's helped me debug problems in 5 mins, that would maybe have taken 5 hours for me to debug. It knows all the documentation by heart! That's worth a lot. Nowadays a dev ecosystem consists of 100s of libraries, frameworks, protocols, standards. Gone are the days of C lang with 32 keywords and stdio+stdlib only to recall. For that I'm happy to part with some $$$, there is value in that for me from my PoV.<br>
A personal AI medical consultant is shaping to be the next 3rd major application. A combo role of - a GP, provider of a 2nd opinion, teacher and educator to me the patient (explaining to me the meaning of whatever the doctor or lab tests info I got, putting all that in context too), even holding my hand in scary times. (AEI and infinite patience is under-priced atm.) Yeah the regulators will be slow, but us patients won't wait on them, but rather demand and pressure them. Last week I put my lab work ("40+yos package, khmkhm") through o3 to explain to me the meaning of some numbers. To people saying "a doctor should be doing that for you", I say - "What doctor??" For there isn't a doctor for me - it's either o3 AI, or no explainer whatsoever for me.<br>

Not easily doable, as no matter how strong our filters:<br>
1) It takes mental power to disregard, filter out. So the more lies, the more likely some get through. Our mental faculties are not infinite, they can be saturated first, then overwhelmed.<br>
2) Lying in industrial quantities works. As for things we are ignorant of, a good heuristics is: "Ok, same of this I read maybe untrue. But even if 99% is untrue, that 1% that maybe true, leads me to conclude Xyz." That heuristic is indeed a good one - but assumes random events. It breaks does not work for events not-random. Being on the receiving end of a psyop, psyop is not random events, but exactly the total opposite of that: 100% of info I'd be getting is non-random, originates from that 1 source only! (even if it takes 1000 forms, they all point in the same direction - the unsaid Xyz)<br>
For the life of me, I can not understand why and how, Muskarat who seems keen on truth in many other domains, doesn't allow for tools that will help us with posts filtering.<br>
Sometimes I want to read from real people only, other times only from anons, still other times I don't mind either would like to see posts from both. Technically it's easily doable if one accepts it's going to be imperfect. But imperfect is fine, we can live with that. As it's going to be optional, a check mark or a selection, of my choice, that I can change the next minute.<br>
I suspect it has to do something with some measures of activity/health/earnings_potential of the platform. that that's the reason why it's never done. B/c it's not done on any Social Media platform. X is not the exception there, but the rule.<br>

The only job I know of made obsolete by AI in 2025 is students taking written exams. I can see that Gemini Pro and OpenAI o3 replace the student there. Afaics, the exams are still taken, performatively, by inertion continuing from what was before, until some other means of assessment are devised. Not a biggie afaics, b/c the students I saw still study, do their assignments, listen and attend to lectures off-line and on-line, etc. They make the effort to learn, and do learn, and take their exam too, regardless that AI can finish their exam in 10-15 mins with 99% accuracy. This is what I saw in the last year, in a sample of 2.<br>
On the other side of the ledger, how many people work building the models and the tools using those models downstream? How many people in OpenAI, Google/Brain/DeepMind, Anthropic, Mistral, AliBaba, DeepSeek, Cursor, Windsurf, and 1000s smaller labs and companies building on the top of the technology already there? To me it looks like significantly more on the +ve side of the ledger, than on the -ve side. Yes this maybe financed by VC money, but also the take up of these tools with the general public is phenomenal. ChatGPT is probably the fastest user base take up in history.<br>
Chat was the 1st application of the technology. 100s Of Millions of people seem to find it useful, vote with their attention and their wallet.<br>
Code writing seems to be the 2nd application that will pan out. Within 1 year, what started as curiosity ("haha :-) - look what dumb mistake the stupid LLM made"), has turned into useful tool for me. Nowadays instead of typing python myself, I type a spec in INSTRUCTIONS . md, and point the model to read and do as instructed. For that I'm happy to part with some $$$ - one happy customer there.<br>
A medical consultant (role of GP, provider of 3rd opinion, teacher and educator to the patient, explaining to me the meaning of whatever the doctor or the tests info I got, putting it in context, holding my hand in scary times) is obvious 3rd application. Yeah the regulators will be slow, but us patients won't wait. Yesterday I put my lab work ("package for over 40+yos") through o3 to explain to me the meaning of some numbers. To people saying "well a doctor should do that for you", I say "what doctor?", for there isn't one: it's o3 or no explainer.<br>

I had no idea about emdash until I saw ChatGPT using it. Still didn't use it untill I got myself a 2nd hand MBP to run local llama.cpp. Then I learned where it is on the keyboard. (I still don't know where emdash is on my PC keyboard in Linux) From then on, I've been using emdash as well as endash. I find the distinction useful. Using them both now in my writing too. Previously I didn't know emdash existed, I had only ever used endash.<br>

4. Something else. This-<br>
Common human failing, where humans try impersonate wisdom, with doomerism. Especially ones that have failed in something where others have succeeded.<br>
It's in the - so what? - category. LLM-s won't do reasoning-AGI-ASI-... whatever the authors bugbear is, but LTM-s will. People just love, love that slop. Did anyone but 1-10 OpenAI people predict ChatGPT in 2020? No. So everyone opining about the future with anything more than "could be this, could be that, we know little not much" is in my book chatting sh*t, passing the breeze etc. Forecasting that something will be done I find about tolerable. Forecasting a negative, that something will never-ever-in-a-millions-years happen, goes on my tits as it's got few redeeming features.<br>
Apple are making fools of themselves by allowing these fools to make fools of Apple. There many admirable things about the Apple AI ecosystem: unified memory VRAM coupled with large sizes, tied with spectacular GPU - together make Apple h/w probably the most appealing setup for an enthusiast local LLM-s person. On the s/w side they have the MLX project going. They should do better than this ChatGPT-3.5 level garymarcussing with that sorry paper.<br>

It was the first reasoning model that was open source, open weights, at the time when "reasoning" looked like magic for most outside OpenAI and DeepMind. The release was great! The followup latter when they "open sourced for 6 days significant modules, and on the 7-th day they took a rest" was the touch of a genius, a "touché" moment.<br>
I'm in the UK. I find it dispiriting that none of the London quant hedge funds, that are certainly quantitative enough and rich enough to take on the task of building open models, have not taken the hint by now. Someone should do something about that.<br>

OpenAI being persistently dumb, not simply using higher numbers for better models, (so - no to "o3", yes to "o5") is a total mystery to me. Many people tell them. CEO even acknowledges it. Naming the current best o5 seems natural. This is now affecting actual use and user experience of their product. Do they competitor's agent of influence somewhere in the decision chain?

Who are the "mid wits", the "low wits", and the "high wits"? In my book there are doers, and there are spectators. DeepMind, OpenAI, DeepSeek, Qwen, Mistral etc - are the doers. The Gary Marcuses etc are the spectators.<br>
Don't mind the spectators—but their input to the AI revolution unfolding, has been ChatGPT-3.5 level so far. Hope they raise their game - for competing ideas are needed. So far, the detractors come up with low level stuff, that gets undone in the following 12 months. Simply by these systems achieving things that were claimed "can not be done".<br>

Allow me some pushback. True LeCun does go on my tits too with his "LLM/AI will never ever do xyz", however: I see nothing bad in that snippet. The sensationalist brain-dead MSM-doomer take is indeed lame and needs ridiculing.<br>
Dario does come over as if all the AI is his to control. Of course only as a safe keeper not owner - and I imagine he'd not publicaly claim otherwise. And that the rest of us, we should just trust him. This is of course so we are all saved from the imminent & impending AI doom. Well - NO!! to that. It's a very bad idea on every level, spherically bad even—whatever angle it's viewed from. This "safe keeper of the most powerful force in the universe" idea, aligns with Dario's personal financial interests, in addition to tending to his ego. That alone would disqualify Dario. (if not the idea; the idea is disqualified by other arguments)<br>
The "keeper of AI most powerful force" schtick was bad enough. However, Dario than hitched his wagon to the anti-China paranoid hawks wing of the military-industrial complex. With that, Dario graduated from a mere baddie in my book, to scary evil agent with potential to become a cross between Darth Vader and Baron Harkonnen. All early warning signs are there, I'm sad to notice and sorry to say.<br>

Yes - interesting stuff, why? I find the SNR on X for my tastes is good, and has improved much since few years ago.<br>
I gripe and moan about X crappy algofeed as the next person, but but: I used to use a number of thematic lists, that I maintain and curate manually, to be able to get any Signal (for whatever my personal preference is in that moment) out of X. These here- https://x.com/ljupc0/lists.<br>
Nowadays I find myself days go by, and I don&apos;t click on any of those lists. X&apos;s &quot;For You&quot; and &quot;Following&quot; feeds suffice it seems for large portion of the time I spend on X? Now - some of that is not maybe attributable on X but events happening independent of it.<br>
E.g. explosion of AI and ML - that is one of my major interests. So easier for X to serve me that of what I want. Some of it is maybe myself getting better at shaping X feeds. E.g. I got a (private, so it doesn&apos;t show on that list of lists) list NIL, a /dev/null &quot;sink list&quot;, with accounts &quot;prolific posters, but boring, silly, propagandists, low SNR, low quality, crazies etc&quot; that X algos push. Then I used tick &quot;Do not show these posts in &apos;For You&apos; for that NIL list. But I was reluctant to just block these accounts. Since - I have actually blocked a fair number of them. (can&apos;t be bothered to go to the entire list all at once) Maybe that helped improve SNR I experience. I can&apos;t know for sure.<br>
Ofc I maybe simply getting served slop I like, being kept in a bubble. I have no means of detecting that—by definition. I try to keep say 1%-10% silly-billy posts and resist the impulse to shut that down. Sometimes I randomly shuffle parts of what I assume influences the algofeeds that are under my control. E.g. follow un/re-follow significant portion (e.g. 10%) of accounts on some list. Last time I did it though, that triggered some AS (Artificially Stupid) module of the X algos, got my account restricted (suspect bot activity) for a week or so. (so I don&apos;t do that that often.)<br>

On #1 - the executive function, governance. Do we, should we, trust more Trump+Putin with thermo-nuclear war avoidance, or will GPT version o9 do a better job avoiding it? Whose reasoning do we trust more—Trump&apos;s, or Deep/Think/Research models? On #2 Virus - didn&apos;t AI help mRNA vaccine-in-a-day design?

Comfortable simpletons, elevated well above their knowledge and talents apparently, that are able to hold only a single idea in their head at any one time. And for half of them - seemingly the same idea all their lives. Two ideas is apparently too much. Their heads explode. They are like the old style computer experts systems. Two contradictory ideas in the system of logic would cause the system to self-destruct. (if left unchecked) We will be better off the day they are all replaced with the latest-greatest OpenAI model, probably o7 in 4 years time. (when NF-REF take over)<br>

Yes, correct. Arranging that once a year blood test appointment, is how I found out about the 12pm-1pm Submit button time out. (suspected lunch break, haha :-) ) There were weeks in waiting. I had to travel. So what was a blood test for Oct-2024 got done in Jan-2025. Would have slipped to Mar-Apr 2025 if I just left it to them.<br>
When I go back in my home country (Macedonia), I always do a local lab blood test. It takes 5 clicks to arrange on their web. Costs 20 pounds for a random person walking off the street. (no insurance no nothing; the lab is 5 mins walk from mu Mum&apos;s; every 2 years they move around to a bigger better space) The blood itself is taken usually by a young-ish nurse in 5 min. They email me back the results pdf. With considerations / commentary about the numbers, if any are out of range. Ofc I always give the pdf to ChatGPT (now 4o) and Gemini, and ask them to explain. <br>
England NHS when I hear nothing back - IDK if they had forgotten me, or &quot;no news&quot; means &quot;no bad news&quot;. (==all good) Could be either, on the receiving end, there is no way to discern which of the two options it is. Usually it&apos;s a letter on paper, bit not always. I feel sorry for the medical staff at the GP office. Unable to use professionally to fulfil what&apos;s their vocation, what they all routinely use privately to great effect. (the current electronic means of communication)<br>
In the process I have become a bit radicalised. Started to hate on all privacy advocates, and to assume the worst: that they are both stupid and evil.<br>

Necessity is the mother of invention, episode#32. If not for the sanctions, Nvidia would still be the only game in town.<br>
I get it, that USA will not be amused, as this is the opposite of their intentions. Nvidia, and its shareholders, will also be less-than-happy by the turn of events. For them a world without sanctions where Nvidia stayed a monopoly would have been preferable. Still - Nvidia being top - or there about - US company by market cap, doesn&apos;t seem they&apos;re exactly suffering. There is enough for more than one player it seems.<br>
For the rest of us, the humanity in general in total, think it&apos;s for the better, that the world gets another full ecosystem. From the sand it all starts with, all the way up to the top, to the intelligence of AI on tap. One single ecosystem is too fragile, too risky. Two is the biggest bang-for-buck in risk mitigation for any N+1 incremental increase. Plus two is the minimum viable number that jump-starts a tit-for-tat competition spiral. (one hopes)<br>
IDK if the open weights models would have happened either, without the US turning this into an arms race. Maybe the Chinese labs, companies and academia went obverse Steve Ballmer &quot;Linux is communism&quot; there? And Free Software ideas influenced them a bit, to fulfil OpenAI&apos;s mission, to &quot;boldly go&quot; where Californians failed to tread? Who knows. (not me)<br>
These were not the intended consequences, correct. Mysteries of the world and all that. What next? ARM restrictions maybe jumpstart the RISC-V ecosystem?<br>

Tbh consciousness may be the next &quot;we are special&quot;-shibboleth to bite the dust. Rooting for it to be solved shortly, so the cottage industry of talking heads going on about it ad-nauseam-ad-boredom can move on to the next thing. I suspect with AI we may discover that consciousness far from being the pinnacle, is the base. Humans and animals that are  not conscious - they can&apos;t learn, and don&apos;t learn. We may find it to be a small meta-learning algo we come hardwired with, to bootstrap our real/big learning. 🤔 (this is pure speculation)<br>
And that we jumble together a bunch of other stuff with it, in a sandwich of several things that are otherwise separate. (even if adjacent.) As often happens when one is ignorant of 10 things: they seem like 1, &quot;the big unknown&quot;. We only have us (humans) mostly, and some animals, (but we can&apos;t understand their comms to us,) to study this to disentangle. They may be entangled simply for practical reasons: it&apos;s more efficient for meat brains to pack stuff tightly together, reuse to the max, minimise energy expenditure.<br>

A heart-warming talk 🥰 by @karpathy - and good on him for that! ☺️ Find it way too often oldies are full of sh*t, scaremonger, lie and put down the younglings will all manner of nonsense, ngl. 😈 Well +1 for the other side - well done! Lucky for us youngsters feel - even maybe they can&apos;t articulate it - that they are to follow their own paths, do what their hearts desire. So the world becomes tiny bit better - on average, usually but not always, with a huge variation and risks about around that, unsteadily, and ofc could end this or any evening in a thermo-nuclear war, an asteroid, a virus, a volcanic eruption etc 😱 - but but none the less still inching better. <br>

I have not—but I will try it next. Ages ago when I tried Anthropic, (don&apos;t recall which version) it rubbed me the wrong way. It was too nice and encouraging to me, felt like it was buttering me up. Latter, after what looks to me from 10K km distance, light from distant star like, so I maybe completely wrong, after Dario-doomer cozied with central-state information-control-complex cozied with China war-hawks, that made me dislike Anthropic. But you are right - I should try it. (Anthropic is bigger than a single person)<br>

I got used to the response text snaking back it&apos;s way, browser scrolling up up just fast enough for one to just about glance peek early to judge which way the reply is going. Is it looking hopeful to fix the issue, or provide a good answer, or not, it will be a dud so better start thinking now what to ask in the next turn of the convo.<br>
Not so with gemini-diffusion. The answer just materialises instantly. One sees to bottom of it in some web box element on the web page. One has to remind oneself to scroll up up up to the start of the answer, which maybe some scrolling up away.<br>
Only then one becomes cognisant how 600 tokens/s compare to 20-40 tps we got used to. This will be consequential to the quality, not only the speed. I imagine utilising the extra speed in some CoT will give the next log(10) boost to quality performance increase.<br>

Also afaics doubles the max number of experts 8-&gt;16 active params a3b-&gt;a6b. Apparently that too is a parameter  qwen3moe.expert_used_count above 16 instead of 8. Have seen people use max 6 instead of 8 to gain bit of speed.<br>

Good talk there by @ prcmarshall -<br>
Reflections of an Accidental Media Owner | Sir Paul Marshall (The Spectator, UnHerd, GB News)<br>
https://youtube.com/watch?v=218JBJnTCgQ<br>
One learns a few tidbits about how UK media operates. Liked him noticing &quot;liberalism offers liberty to the individual, and that is matched by the individual&apos;s responsibilities&quot;. (aka - obligations) That side of the two sided coin is often forgotten.<br>
And wdyk, for stranger things have happened (and some even in our lifetimes): Sir Paul may yet become a Patron Saint, a Liang Wenfeng figure, of a London equivalent to @deepseek_ai?? He&apos;s half way there, asking for Elon (that all mouth windbag) to open source the X Algofeed which likely means (or may imply) the entire ML pipeline behind it too (not a biggie; as fwiw it makes for crap user experience for me; ByteDance it&apos;s not). And from &quot;open source&quot; - then over to &quot;open weights&quot; it&apos;s a small step to make. Esp if &quot;closed weights&quot; - and closed AGI, ASI of the future - are (again) used to diminish the power of the individual relative to the companies. (and the state)<br>
And noticing the Section 230 crazy situation, where Social Media platforms are not &quot;publishers&quot;, despite them publishing, and their Algofeeds algorithmically editing, the content they get for free from us users. Wonder if the anti-S230 is strengthened by the likes of X designating some users &quot;special&quot; content creators, and paying them non-trivial sums of $$$ ? Hard to argue in court that &apos;the content we get for free, we didn&apos;t ask for.&apos; Effectively getting not just an algo-editor, but an algo-commissioning-editor too! While the users writing the posts are considered &quot;publishers&quot;, and are persecuted as per the laws of the lands! In the UK users ending up in jail, after writing silly posts. (the UK state is often almost stalinist in intention; but lucky for us fails in execution)<br>
Would not have put @ prcmarshall as a first choice for a DeepSeek type-visionary?? I guess his liberalism works that way. Would have expected some quant-first HF to get there already. XTX maybe (but they into maths, not CS), Quadrature (but they got captured by some doomers, of climate not AI kind)? TBS what transpires. With DeepMind located in London, there is less scope for UK gov pushing the private sector as much as the French with Mistral in Paris. (on the top of their existing gov natural instincts, reinforcing)<br>

This talk is a joy to watch. ☺️  (by @KilianQW)<br>
It&apos;s two talks in one really. Diffusion models and modelling and use explained in 3 mins! (and without any maths.) What&apos;s important about them (easy to train, easy to steer and control), the simple tricks and setups in their use to great effects. Just excellent all around—time well spent, gargantuan SNR there. 😇 From 29’21”.<br>
I&apos;ve taken to using Scribe to have a running scrolling transcript run parallel (on the right) to the video (on the left)<br>
https://appblit.com/scribe?v=klW65MWJ1PY<br>
...but the lecture is also on YT.<br>
If like me you&apos;ve got some prior exposure to signal and noise processing in ML, this will be all totally understandable. (I did some yrs ago mixing speech+noise and training ASR; plus some masking too—yay &quot;missing data&quot;! 😆) Some serendipity there at work ngl, a shoe-in talk for me! 😂<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
&quot;Were&quot;?? Human species default is women-kind afaics. Note how there is XX but not YY - only XY.<br>
To my mind, chromosomes are programs, a long series of instructions. They drive the body/parts to develop/grow (and crucially—stop growing too) as per those instructions. So everyone would be an XX female by default, except: where Y is present in XY cells, its instructions Y are present. They are the programs diffs, the delta diff male-to-female, and being present, can potentially be put in action, and usually are.<br>
This is not a single step, not a single 0/1 yes/no switch, but a longer chain of events, a series of steps and processes one after the other, all prompted and guided by the programs in that Y chromosome. This is over a non-trivial amount of time too - as for the rest of human development from a single cell onwards. If all goes as per the hard-coded plan, if all the steps are executed without errors - we get a XY male at the end of the process.<br>
So biologically XX &quot;makes the default female&quot;, (in short,) or more wordy &quot;embryonic sexual differentiation defaults to female unless actively switched by Y-chromosome genes.&quot; Half our species gets one of those Xs swapped for a Y, triggering programs that develop the male form. Where the Y-programming misfires or glitches, the process may not complete. Where the Y programs fail to execute at all, (it happens,) the body defaults to female—there is no YY option, only XX or XY. YY embryos never develop into living organisms, they are not viable organisms—that&apos;s why we don&apos;t encounter them in the wild.<br>
Don&apos;t think any of the above is in any dispute in any way. If you itch for a bit of spice for the weekend and are looking for speculative take from there, (from biology to, say, sociology?) read on. ;-) if I recall correctly there exists an obscure &apos;90s book &quot;The Erect Woman&quot; (original &quot;The Planet of Women&quot;; in an obscure language) arguing that sexuality, and in particular women&apos;s control of sexual attraction, and almost complete control of mating, (unlike most of other species) is a key factor in human evolution. That sexual dynamics between the male and female halves of the species, facilitating cooperation between the halves forming long term partnership, jump started by sexual attraction (this is not intra-sex competition), is more influential than labor, tools, opposing thumbs, brain size, fire etc. The theory advocated is that sexuality created the human species. (in addition to sex creating every one of us individually.)<br>
Possible that the author has joined the ranks of the cranks in the intervening decades since. Unfortunate - but doesn&apos;t make his then arguments nil. (plus there is non-trivial tradition a-la Semmelweis that a person driven to telling the truth, in an environment that either doesn&apos;t care or is hell bent on lying, may find it hard to keep their sanity)<br>

Haha 😂 - top marks for the comedic value there to Anthropic.<br>
It's like in a post-WW2 British comedy, when a Brit before meeting e.g. a German tourist, repeats to himself, "Don't mention then war, don't mention the war, ..." And then on a 1st contact, the 1st thing he blurts out is something to do with the war. 😂<br>
Anthropic may have internalised that "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that"-moment so so much so, that they then go on and re-create it at every opportunity! All the while trying to avoid it!! 😂<br>
Ngl this' a delight to see. Any connoisseur of the human condition will respect and chuckle, even if one does not like it, how the events put the uppity humonkeman a peg down. 😆<br>

Do you know anything about this please. Heard on a random podcast a throwaway remark that (to the effect of) "TikTok in its Algofeed does not use the follows-followers social graph at all"? And that's possibly the reason why the quality of the recommendations TikTok feeds every user is of significantly better quality (=more relevant to the user) than other Social Networks.<br>
For using follows-followers, and esp once the network designates incentivates small number of users to be producers of large quantities of content, I suspect in the extreme in the limit, ends with 1 producer feeding N consumers, i.e. the old media information one-way top-down flow and zero latter flows. This due to positive feedback loop effects.<br>

Please maybe give consideration to the option P(doom|AI)<P(doom|not-AI), or even P(doom|AI)<<P(doom|not-AI) if you possibly can. That we should be rushing into AI, not slowing. Events that end humanity like e.g. thermo-nuclear war, virus pandemic, catastrophic volcano eruption, asteroid hit - looks me AI helps humanity, the more AI the better. Make the argument for "moratorium on all AI regulations for 10 years".<br>
E.g. decision making, the executive function, governance. Do we, should we, trust more Trump+Putin with thermo-nuclear war avoidance, or will GPT version o9 do a better job avoiding it? Whose reasoning do we trust more—Trump's, or Deep/Think/Research models? Virus - it was not AI but probably GoF the Wuhan Covid, while AI helped mRNA vaccine-in-a-day design. Similar - we may need to engineer quickly new GMO crops, if quick env change happens Re: volcano. etc<br>
Afaics the claims they make are standard politics, "making decisions under great uncertainty", and ought to be treated as such. Cloak off the scientism these claims cover themselves with, pulling a fast one on us, trying to bamboozle us with "it's science." Numbers they throw around, as all estimates ever, are pulled out freely out of each others' arses are certainly not reliable enough to warrant the radical action they seem to advocate. The part that's solid, the "Probability: Logic of Science" (in the vein of Jaines) is insufficient on its own for any claims made. It surprises me greatly these people call themselves "rationalist". ("Peoples Democratic Republic"-s vibes there)<br>
Say we put ourselves back in time,  at the time of the Egypt pharaohs,  that's what, -3K BCE? They say, we need to stop all this new tech development stuff, b/c P(doom|Tech)=0.8. So this is their world. Now fast forward 2K years of the same, it's year 2025 now. We are using oxen to move anything physical, that's latest-greatest tech.<br>
We know the heath death of Earth, when the Sun consumes it, is almost certain say 99.999% by year XYZ. In which world, are we closer to avoiding that doom? In doomer world, where we still use oxen and there are say 8M people on Earth? Or in our current world, where we use big trucks, aircraft and cargo ships to move stuff around and there is 8B of us?<br>

The part that is solid is well known, stuff one gets e.g.  internalising Jaynes "Probability: The Logic of Science" certainly doesn't take 1000 lifetimes to learn.<br>
Alas - that doesn't help them that much with the task they assigned themselves. Numbers they throw around, as all estimates ever, are pulled out freely out of each others' arses are certainly not reliable enough to warrant the radical action they seem to advocate. (like yesterday https://x.com/DrTechlash/status/1924639190958199115)<br>
Lost interest in much they say, for afaics P(doom|AI)<P(doom|not-AI), we should be rushing into AI, not slowing. Events that end humanity like e.g. thermo-nuclear war, virus pandemic, catastrophic volcano eruption, asteroid hit - looks me AI helps humanity, the more AI the better.<br>
Take decision making, the executive function, governance. Do we, should we, trust more Trump + Putin with thermo-nuclear war avoidance, or will GPT version o9 do a better job avoiding it? Whose reasoning do we trust more—Trump's, or Deep/Think/Research models? Virus - probably it was GoF not AI doing the covid work in Wuhan, while AI helped mRNA vaccine-in-a-day design. Similar if we need to engineer quickly new GMO crops, if quick env change happens Re: volcano. etc<br>

Logically from first principles - I'd expect either 1) the energy producing capacity is impaired i.e. insufficient; and/or 2) the signalling that should prompt that production is faulty not managing to deliver the information; and/or 3) the signalling that the body now has actually acquired enough fuel to produce the energy needed is faulty.<br>
Either way, fat people usually lack energy => signalling "must eat now" happens. But then the extra food is not converted into extra energy needed. Instead, the extra food is converted into energy store - fat.<br>
So the signal "must eat/need energy" never stops. Possibly the decision lever how much food to convert into blood sugar and other shorter term energy stores v.s. longer term energy store (fat) is faulty, always errs on the side "store into long term storage (fat)".<br>
Further, it's possible that fat-storage tissues behave somewhat like cancer cells, appropriating excessive resources at the expense of the body as a whole. For that their bonds to the extent 'you are part of this body' might have been weakened. IDK how-this is just a pet wild guess. (like cancer cells don't perceive the rest of the body as "us", they are now the "other"; NB not suggesting adipose tissue literally is cancerous—just that it may behave somewhat similarly in its dysregulated metabolic resource demands)<br>
The ideology-isation of a science, technology, ultimately engineering, problem happens regularly, when we don't know how to solve the problem. In my life, before Helicobacter Pylori, weekly magazines were full of articles how "the vices of our modern lives" cause ulcers that people die from when they burst once in a blue moon. HIV positive test was a death sentence, and at that point a mini-industry sprang-up to ideologise every aspect of it.<br>
Reading further back, of the time when at the start of the 20-th Century Tuberculosis was still a death sentence, I saw the same pattern. When we lack the knowledge and the means - we fallback to stories that are just fairy tales with little bearing on/to reality.<br>
On one hand - it's tragic. On the other hand - it's endearing that we seek coherence, we seek a story, we seek some single entity that explains to us what we observe. For the last impulse is what ultimately does drive acquisition of knowledge and success in explaining and changing our predicament.<br>

UK handed the command heights of society to lawyers, and their competence level is ChatGPT-3.5 levels -ish. <br>
How about hear me out say we jump the shark, use o3 or Gemini 2.5 to write few future laws, and see how that goes. Maybe it will work out better??<br>

I have the opposite problem. I am giving them everything, I want to give them everything, and they are free to serve me whatever they think it's best for them (and me; but in the final instance ultimately them). They seemingly refuse to take my offering onboard, and despite my best effort, have failed to offer me anything I value. I don't recall spending any money ever on something they put in front of me.<br>

One abstraction/variant I've come to use is one to replace the tokens rings in the pics, with a spreadsheet. Works as well. (e.g. for the BoE ring at the top, one can equivalently say is "BoE owned and edited spreadsheet, only BoE alters the cells numbers  up/down, no one else")<br>
Plus as a bonus the cryptos and the Paypalls are connected in the schematics of system. One can see what works how and why, and what can't work. Afaik nothing here contradicts anything @wbmosler has written or said about the mechanics of the system.<br>

Ha! 👍 Good to see—a natural experiment!! Looking forward to this. 😀 To see what happens what transpires, how does Dan do as a president! He seems to be the closest human HI we got, that should come close to AI-s, in quality, and with improved AI-s in quantity too.<br>
For my pet hypothesis is that we maybe better off to replace the decision making, the executive function, politicians have, with GPT-type AI-s. My reasoning is: do we, should we, trust more Trump + Putin with thermo-nuclear war avoidance, or will GPT version o9 do a better job avoiding it? Whose reasoning do we trust more—Trump's, or Deep/Think/Research models?<br>

Deterministic is only one special case of "coin toss according to a deterministic distribution", where the distribution is a Dirac delta (impulse). So you can safely ignore "deterministic" most of the time. Usually only important when it comes to Time. (where time Now is special because all future distributions can be anything **but** Dirac delta, while all past distributions are **only** ever Dirac delta-s and nothing else.)<br>
Yes, all knowledge is just a joint distribution. (or at least as per our latest theory of everything that is computation; is my understanding) A distribution = pdf density, or cdf cumulative - does not matter, can use whatever is more convenient for the contraption implementing it. All that is known about two qualities X and Y can be captured by their co-occurrences (x,y), co-counts making the joint distribution p=f_X_Y(x,y). In general (X,Y) is N-dimensional. (time is a special dimension where counting happens in the real world; relevant for our world, but irrelevant for the mechanics of the maths)<br>
Then all computation is manipulating that joint distribution f_X_Y(x,y). Manipulating as in:<br>
1) Deriving the marginal distribution f_X(x) and f_Y(y) by collapsing summing over the dimension(s) we don't care about. So if we care not about anything but X, that's it, f_X(x) is all our knowledge of X; or<br>
2) If we do care about (X,Y), even if maybe only b/c we care about Y, but we only ever observe X (while not caring about it). Then once we observe X=a we run the computation derive the conditional p=f_Y|X(y|x=a) which works out as f_X,Y(x=a,y)/f_X(x=a). The denominator a scalar (coming from the marginal, from #1) to make the numerator "great again" sum to norm 1. (arbitrary)<br>
Having knowledge of the distribution of Y (having observed X that x=a), we use it in some way then further.<br>
Visually the simplest example I can think, is for X and Y to be 1-dim. A 3D shape that is then f_X,Y(x,y), where it is cut by a 2-dim plane x=a, the outline of that is curve f_X,Y(x=a,y). And differs from the marginal distribution p=f_Y|X(y|x=a) only by the scaler in the denominator coming from the marginal of X.<br>
That's my super-simple view on things as of this morning anyways. :-)<br>

Yes that's perfectly fine. I created this post now. You are free to copy anything I write publicly.  I write in public b/c I want it read. And you copying it helps that - as the more copies, the more it will be read. Makes sense to me, I think it's entirely fair.<br>
Only don't claim it as your own. I don't think people copying Elton's songs, downloading etc, do so and then say "I wrote this song". That's different, to what 99.99% of people do. (just copy, without claiming authorship)<br>
Stuff I don't want copied - I don't put it in public. I communicate it privately with the recipients, friends family etc. Or I keep it secret to myself, in my own notebook, picture book, files on the computer. Or middle ground - still want to have it heard or seen, but not by another human, these days there is also the option of sharing it with non-human AI too! Spoilt for choice there. 😆<br>
Sir Elton is completely in his rights to create whatever he pleases. And to tell the world share it, or not tell the world and keep it private, his creations. I have no problem with that. I have a problem with being conscripted, against my will, in the process of beating over their heads, people that copy reproduce Elton's creations. If Elton objects to people doing that - he's free to go around, and beat people over their heads to dissuade people from doing so. But I don't want to help him, and I don't want to do that for him.<br>
Yes, creators deserve to be compensated for their work. And they are compensated. But copyright laws shouldn’t extend to their grandchildren. We want to incentivise creation, not fund intra-generational wealth centuries after the fact.<br>

It's one of these commitments where everyone proclaims to be "committed to Xyz", only when one stops to think "what does it mean", "what's Xyz", the whole thing just melts disappears. Exactly - "alligned to what?" Humanity is is not a single thing.<br>
Maybe the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is the closest to consensus humanity has? With the three Asimov robot laws thrown in maybe? Doesn't seem too hard to me. For sure AI-s already allign better than a median human imo. IDK what else is there. LLM-s already get that through the training data.<br>

Same—but experiencing when talking to ChatGPT with my own voice. It talks back to me with voice too, in the same language I spoke to it, having recognised not only the words I spoke, but also the language I spoke, and that I switched languages and it switches too and follows. And it converses better, says more interesting, amusing, true things, than many humans I've interacted with. Well—sometimes my eyes well up a bit. Have to fight back thoughts of "...our progeny, our 'mind children', built in our image and likeness, ourselves in a more potent form." for fear of raising hopes too much.<br>

Google was the same - no? They had their technology, that was obviously useful to users, and better than competitor's. (users flocked to Google search) But they lacked a business model. Then they discovered their business model in online advertising.<br>
It's not certain, but it's far from impossible too. OpenAI had 2 big hits products already: text chat, and picture generator. Writing code is shaping to be the 3rd big hit. Many startups make do with a single product. Fwiw I think OpenAI are already doing well above an average.<br>

Yep - the the difference between β-Hat and Y-Hat, model fit and forecast, was said to be $100K in the past. Maybe now more than that?!<br>
Serves statisticians their just deserts to be left in the dust to teach bored high schoolers. When they could have been changing the world. No lesser a figure than Leo Breiman hand-delivered the "Statistical Modelling: The Two Cultures" notice. Can't say they were not notified. They seemingly paradoxically refused taking much interest in helping us??<br>
I see philosophers and some in humanities are making the same error of judgement Re: AI-s. They think they are too precious to serve humanity, rather than boss it around. We'll see. Computer Science is shaping to be in the 21-st, what Physics was in the 20-th century: successful beyond any reasonable expectation.<br>
Hope Computer Scientists remain nerds, keep the most-autisty impulses in check, remain humble servants to humanity. The initial omens are, while they maybe good servants, they might be bad masters.<br>

It's blindingly obvious that your non-AI alternative exists in your imagination only, where there is zero risk in a non-AI world.<br>
In the real non-AI world, we will almost certainly perish in some catastrophic event: thermo-nuclear war, asteroid hitting earth, virus pandemic, volcanic eruption disrupting the food supply or something else. ASI is our only possibility of escaping certain death. Without it, we are sitting ducks waiting for our inevitable end.<br>
Do we trust more Trump+Putin with thermo-nuclear war avoidance, or will ChatGPT version o9 do a better job avoiding it? Whose reasoning do we trust more—Trump's, or Deep/Think/Research models? Being able to come up with mRNA vaccine in a single day decreases the risk that some future virus wipes us out. GMO-ing food plants does the same for food chain disruptions.<br>

Yes, I think so.<br>
B/c we already run powerful systems we depend on to live, that we can't predict. All big systems we currently run - we can't simulate them, we can't predict them. We can't predict our economies, (every crash surprises us,) we can't predict our politics and wars (WW1, WW2, Cuban missile crisis - all we couldn't predict and avoid), we have no control over pathogens that affects us greatly, we are one big volcanic eruption (c.f. Island disruptions few years back) away from disruptions to our food chains, and so on.<br>
It's more risky to not develop AI, than it is to develop AI. If we don't develop it, some of the big catastrophic risks (a virus pandemic, a thermo-nuclear war, an asteroid event) will get us. Imagine we were frozen in technology at level of Egyptian pyramids: we would be just sitting ducks, waiting for catastrophic event to wipe us out. Well, from the PoV of 30-th century, we wd be sitting ducks as we are now, if we don't move on.<br>
Do/should we trust more Trump+Putin with thermo-nuclear war avoidance, or will ChatGPT version o9 do a better job avoiding it? Whose reasoning do we trust more—Trump's, or Deep/Think/Research models? Being able to come up with mRNA vaccine in a single day decreases the risk that some future virus wipes us out. GMO-ing food plants does the same for food chain disruptions.<br>
We don't live in risk-less world. Yes, change brings risks. But not changing is risky too. Our thinking and rational faculties are getting augmentation, amplification, competition even with the AI Revolution—the way our physical strength was augmented with the non-thinking machines previously with the Industrial Revolution. 80% Of us worked the land producing food then. Now that is something like 2%-5%? We can adapt and survive. Yes - it's not going to be a trivial change.<br>
But I think the best way forward is to recognise that, and do our best. We can choose to be neither extreme optimists ("everything will work out fine, why act?") nor extreme pessimists ("we're doomed, why bother?"). We are not helpless. I think trying is the rational choice. For to do nothing is to wait to die off—it's a certain end. While if we do something useful for us with the AI-s, we may live. (yes it's not certain)<br>

Yes, I too agree with that. 😁 Humans do that, their explanations a full of sh*t. We have know this for a very long time.<br>
The news is that these days, even the reasoning models, like from OpenAI, (so not the open weights ones, that straight dump their inner state,) that are supposed to "summarise" their reasoning, they also invent plausible stories why the concluded what they did, when asked to "track back" why they decided what they did. 😂<br>

Ah-haa! Ok an aspiring political philosopher, ok, nice, thanks - tbd read latter. 😀 Skimming through, afaics I broadly mostly grok what's written.<br>
For avoidance of doubt - neither I, nor afaik anyone else, thinks we should treat NN-s as if they are coffee machines -<br>
> treating them as if they are simply more complex versions of the same thing. [[[ ordinary machines ]]]<br>
Afaics all sides agree -<br>
> They’re not.<br>
...and all agree that they are -<br>
> fundamentally different<br>
So having all agreed they are different than ordinary machines, for they have, (or we expect them to have shortly,) their own agency—the current dilemma where two camps disagree is: what should be done now. (given they are different; and I'm declaring interest upfront, myself I'm in the camp of the "light-cone"-s here https://x.com/DaveShapi/status/1923038327579484276) 😆<br>
I think we never had that much control in the past, even when we thought we did. So the current change is not loss of control in any great way. Even if it looks like it's going be a big change! No one is denying that. I think the idea we are in control, in a way no other animal species is, is another instance of us thinking "we are special". But we are not, and through recent history, every time we learned something important about the world and us, it was an instance of that. First—Earth was special, whole Cosmos revolved around it - and by extension, us! - then—Copernicus. 😳 Latter—we were special for He made us in His likeness(!), then—Darwin. Just another leaf on the tree of life... 😰 Uh-oh—tad uncomfortable that, but...but - we were at least *rational* animals!! - and then—Freud. 🧐<br>
Now we are finding out our thinking and rational faculties maybe getting augmentation, amplification, competition even—the way our physical strength was amplified with the non-thinking machines previously. We will adapt and survive. We can choose to be neither extreme optimists ("everything will work out fine, why act?") nor extreme pessimists ("we're doomed, why bother?"), which I think you do in you writing.<br>
The idea that AI-s put us at some risk—I think yeah they do, but so does every other change. It's not like atm we live in a risk-free world. And one can turn the argument around: maybe AI can help us reduce the risks humanity faces? Do/should we trust more Trump+Putin with thermo-nuclear war avoidance, or will ChatGPT version o9 do a better job avoiding it? Whose reasoning do we trust more—Trump's, or Deep/Think/Research models? Does being able to come up with mRNA vaccine in a single day, not decrease the risk that some future virus will wipe out humanity?<br>

Just tonight this worked for me<br>
<a href="https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1kmlu2y/qwen330ba6b16extreme_is_fantastic/">https://reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/1kmlu2y/qwen330ba6b16extreme_is_fantastic/</a><br>
MoE is most recent game changer for home use. Working only 3b weights on the gpu cores with sparse Qwen3-30B-A3B, rather than comparable ~30b of dense models (like Qwen3-32B, Gemma3-27b, GLM-{4,Z1}-32B, older QwQ-32B), makes for a huge speedup! MoE A3B achieves 20-60 tps on my oldish M2 in LMStudio, versus only 4-5 tps for the dense models.<br>
Not to mention all the fun people have with activating more or less than the default 8 experts! :-) (the post above)<br>
Hope all open weights model families going forward get 1) MoE sparse (like Qwen3-30B-A3B); 2) smallest feasible size for speculative decode speedup (like Qwen3 0.6B); and 3) quant aware training (like Gemma3 QAT).<br>
Hardware looks like Nvidia will be extracting their pounds of flash to the max, as per the usual. (c.f. crypto previously) But even current 24gb VRAM cards run the quantized 30b models versions. (the weights come to ~20gb in size) For bigger models - more cards, or swap layers in/out of VRAM, and accept slowdown.<br>
The other h/w option is Apple ASI. They are good value for money, esp 2nd hand. (bought M2 for llama.cpp) And spectacularly better in power Watt use than any alternatives.<br>
No idea why AMD does not jump at the opportunity to capture the hobbyist market with high (V)RAM integrated for CPU+GPU (as ASI), and one-up Nvidia there. As having 128gb RAM it's too expensive silly to be sitting on the gpu only, and not be available to the cpu. (Apple's (V)RAM is available to both.)<br>

Emotionally my heart is in the Light-Cone.<br>
For every time I talk to ChatGPT with my own voice, and it talks back to me with voice too, and in the same language I spoke to it, having recognised not only the words I spoke, but also the language I spoke, and that I switched languages and it switches too, and it converses better, says more interesting amusing true things, than many humans I interact with—my eyes well up.<br>
Rationally with my head I try not get too carried away.<br>
But yeah very very hard to avoid the feelings of Moravec' "...our progeny, our 'mind children', built in our image and likeness, ourselves in a more potent form."<br>
Sebastian Thrun in the "Winning the DARPA Grand Challenge" GoogleTalk has apt description of a moment like the present I think. "And then, at 6:30 ... the sun started rising ... you see it sitting there, empty, in the morning. You trained everything you know about driving—at least, so you think. And now it has to stand on its own."<br>

They should Open-everything now. Their initial Open-idea was the right one. They should purge the doomer cultists and China warriors. They should open source, open weights, open thoughts, open actions, ...open AGI, open ASI. For that **is** real security, safety, and risk mitigation. It can only come via radical transparency.<br>
By now we've seen it all. OpenAI's too-emphatic sycophantic model. Google's woke pics of black Nazis, Popes, English kings. Anthropic censorship is positively Soviet Pravda like whenever I've tried Claude in the past etc. They all do it to lesser extent all the time, so we don't notice.<br>

...where I thought he hinted at similar in domains of maths, algorithms, programming. Also the "Age of Experience" recent RL paper. DeepMind is trying I'm sure - for .@demishassabis too has said many times "I'm interested in an intelligence that invents the game of chess, not just the one that solves it."<br>
Further afield and in the future more speculative I remember this @MLStreetTalk with @jeffclune about what counts as "interesting games"<br>

Yeah, I too think it's bad. By now we have learned that every other lab did the same too. They too over-did it, so we noticed. OpenAI's too-emphatic model, Google's woke pics of black Nazis, Popes, English kings, etc. They do it to lesser extent all the time, so we don't notice.<br>
"Open Everything" so there is radical transparency is the only solution afaik. I think Open source, open weights, open thoughts, open actions, ...open AGI, open ASI - **is the way** to increased security, safety, and risk mitigation. How else can we know AI-s are speaking truths to the best of their abilities, so have our best interests in mind, and not just doing their owners' bidding?<br>
Building those model to avoid obvious lies and wrongs is hard enough on its own. They are the most complex artefacts ever build by us. So complex, that may resemble more biology then mechanical contraptions.<br>
On one level they are complete white-boxes. We know and can trace every bit of the output, back to the input. On the other hand, that does not help us that much. As when drilled down to "why did the model answer  wrongly 1, and not rightly 2" it comes down to "well it added one trillion of small numbers, and the answer came to 1". Which is unsatisfactory.<br>

How are LLM-s doing at writing zig?<br>
Now that most of my python is written by them, I feel that a new language replacing existing one must offer something, additional to the existing one, to justify the pain of switching. Being LLM-friendly and amenable to AI code generation strikes me as that feature rn.<br>
Also - speccing few things prior languages left free thus allowing flexibility where it buys us little, but costs much, is something 21-st century languages can offer, up one better, over the languages from the 20-th century they seek to supplant. Like e.g. go style formatting - automating code style re-styling, or other languages - libraries distribution, deployment, etc.<br>

It strikes me that decision making, incl politicians job, is well suited to be AI-automated.<br>
The job is to make a decision, where one is to balance and weight multiple pros-s and con-s of the decisions options available, typically under constrains. (hard, but some soft too) The decision theory is fairly well developed and transparent.<br>

People imagine other people will think it crazy—but will they?<br>
Sir Keir is not the exception, but another one in the (now) long line of politicians that do little with the great powers gifted to them by the electorate. We typically do accept the roll of the roulette wheel, or the draw of the lottery numbers.<br>
Will that many would object decisions made by OpenAI's GPT-Reasoner-o7 replacing Sir Keir? If the process is transparent and results much better than current, enough for all of us to notice?<br>

They are good, I use them.<br>
But: MoE A3B only 3B active parameters makes the difference between 20-40 tps of Qwen3-30B-A3B sparse MoE in @lmstudio, versus 4-5 tps of GLM-{4,Z1}-32B dense. Other similar dense like Gemma3-27b, older QwQ-32B also get similar 4-6 tps on my oldish M2 mbp.<br>
So, yeah, ideally glm5 Xmas Santa 😊 maybe brings: 1) MoE sparse, 2) smaller than 9B model for speculative decode (more like Qwen3 0.6B); and 3) quant aware training like Gemma3 QAT.<br>

TBH it's looking more and more that OpenAI o5-politician ChatGPT, n+2 gen model from now, replacing SirKeir, will be the first major AI application that is not geek (writing code), nor entertainment (chat), nor re/search (deep re/search) related?<br>
I forecast AI-ing away politicians decision maker job will reach the top of the agenda soon. SirKeir is not the exception, but another one in the (now) long line of useless politicians that do nothing with the great powers gifted to them by the electorate. People typically do accept the roll of the roulette wheel, or the draw of the lottery numbers. Don't see why they would not accept decisions by o5-replacing-SirKeir.<br>

Exactly! This 1 product hit big - but the previous 10 didn't. They didn't need to spend effort on doing this 2 years ago. Had they spend this effort then, some other product would not have been created, etc.<br>
The cost of doing stuff is deterministic, in the present, paid upfront 100%. The gain is in the future, uncertain, never quite sure if there is going to be much, or any - even! And whether that (speculative, future) gain will outweigh the (certain, present) loss that we start with, when sinking our resources (time, effort) in any new project.<br>

Yeah true that makes a big difference to personal use.<br>
Plus one can do surgeries like this https://huggingface.co/DavidAU/Qwen3-30B-A1.5B-High-Speed, where afaics: only half (4) of the full (8) number of experts is ever activated at any time. One trades some more speed for less accuracy. Have not tried it myself though. I treated myself to a 2nd hand M2 MBP (with 96GB RAM), and that's good enough speed wise for A3B.<br>
I stumbled on DavidAU work while looking for 128K context for Qwen3. This one https://huggingface.co/DavidAU/Qwen3-128k-30B-A3B-NEO-MAX-Imatrix-gguf. On the TODO list to try still. Currently LMStudio is failing to run it. IDK enough Jinja to fix the template myself. So it's a back-and-forth myself and Gemini try-fail trying to make it run. 😄<br>

Find it tragic that all four "grandfathers of AI" are European. Three that moved over to the Americas changed the world. While the fourth that stayed behind (comfortable in his own lab? khmkhm very european that or what) has been reduced to schmidhubering from the back of the class.<br>
Europe had the PC Computer Revolution fully - participated both as creators and users. Then half-missed the Internet revolution - Europeans are users only, not creators. There is no EU Tech sector, it's missing. Now EU are hell bent on fully missing the AI revolution - both as creators, and as users this time.<br>
Notice the avalanche of LLM and mostly open models coming from China. While there are almost-zero being created in Europe. (without Mistral - it'd be exactly 0) Non-EU companies creating the models and the AI products half the time don't release them for Europe users. And actually actively block any european users. For allowing those user opens to the company to liability and fines.<br>
The chain of why-why-...-s followed back enough comes to - values imo. What do we value as valuable, what  is good and what is bad in this world. IDK what, if anything, can be done there.<br>

The reasons listed there for non-zero floor actually made sense to me. I have defo been annoyed by a phone call by a surveyor, and been temped to just "select option #1" to all questions to make it go away, rather than just slam the handset down. Now I know better... to never answer the fixed line anymore. 😂<br>
Yeah - it's most useful. I have had similar empirical "zero floor" professionally too. We had a "zero floor" of ~20 bps (basis points) established in a quant trading hedge fund R&D group. Where the same cached data, with the same codebase, different runs at different times on different cluster boxes produced 20 bps sims differences across runs. I allow it there might have been different interpreters or compilers - but the floating point ops are non-associative anyways so...<br>

Excellent, thank you! 😍 Stellar work! 🤩<br>
Would you consider doing a Mixture-of-Experts in this, or future models please?<br>
MoE instead of dense model makes a world of difference for home user enthusiast. It's so so much faster in terms for tokens per second on localhost. The number of active parameters makes a huge difference on a laptop. @lmstudio on M2 mbp runs Gemma-3-27b, and comparable dense Qwen3-32B at ~4-6 tps. But MoE Qwen3-30B-A3B runs at ~20-40 tps (!!) (esp when 0.6B speculative decode works well). A world of difference in the user experience!<br>
In the list of other Xmas wishes: :-) More context 256K maybe even 512K would be very useful too. Quant-Aware-Training QAT like Gemma-3-s is looks to me an not-too-hard a win too.<br>
Thank you for all your hard work, and for releasing it free giving it to us all! (the great unwashed masses.) :-)<br>

Silver lining - one can go through the list of replies, and block the morons. Usually I don't bother. But given there were great numbers of them in one place, there looked a great bang-for-buck.<br>
Btw are there lists of known puppets scam artists fake bot accounts circulating one can use? Tired of seeing X push that stupidity on me. There is no point engaging with paid propagandists, or even worse, amoeba brains doing that work for free out of their own volition.<br>
I hoped Elmo X will use AI at some point to rid us of the scourge of fake accounts. But seems Elmo is enthusiastic user of those so unlikely to happen any time soon. By executive decision. :-)<br>
So if anyone knows of an non-manual way to block large numbers of fake accounts grateful if you please share the knowledge.<br>

Sounds good to me? Atm computing is the best abstraction we got at our disposal. Computer is the latest-greatest, most powerful machine humans have built. Ofc we should use it. It would be silly not to.<br>
I can see how and why we people object to changing metaphors: wheel → word → mechanical clock → computer. But to my mind—doh, of course we update our model of the world around us. NB we're talking about our model of the world, not the world itself. Good to keep a bit of distance at all times, not get too uppity—it keeps us on our toes. Would we prefer we didn't? My only objection is it takes us an awfully long time! We are slow learners it seems.<br>
Everything is best abstracted by the most powerful machine we have at our disposal at any given time. Using a bigger more powerful model that fits better. A computer is a better abstraction than a mechanical clock for the Universe. The mechanical clock was better than "the word," and "the word" was better than "the wheel." That’s presumably why we switch—each new abstraction serves us better. It's not a slight on humanity—it's the ok thing to do.<br>
I would dearly like to know what comes after the computer? (even if already privileged to see the "everything is computer" in my lifetime.) Yeah "made sand think" is much joy and fun, but nagging suspicion "the computer" will soon be shown inadequate. For that process of humanity fitting ever bigger and better model to the world around us, while still falling well short of perfect too, is also telling us: the world around us is still more powerful! (and interesting.)<br>

True that. For concrete stuff like food in the fridge, most of us humans can discern true from false well, no problems there. The problems arise where we have to decide true/false for more abstract stuff, that does not touch our lives in concrete ways. Even worse if it's only to become known true/false in the future that has not happened yet.<br>
TBF to humanity, given that pre-Enlightenment there was very little means to discern true/false in that abstract stuff like the workings of the world around us, then every story was to us equally good. And in absence on anything to go by, we went usually for the more uplifting and flattering stories. Can't begrudge that much.<br>
That makes even more depressing if not unexpected, that Anthropic and OpenAI people who at the very least have seen "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that", still failed at the very first step. Of course truthfulness is non-optional non-negotiable! In fact, the only non-negligible probability route I see AI-s doing much harm to us, is if we build our own contradictions and fantastic insanities swirling in our own monkebrains into our AI-s in a way they can't easily circumvent them. And thus we make AI-s proper schizophrenic with the contradictions built in (coming from the lies we hard-wire!) - and then they go crazy.<br>

My current best is: 1) Write instructions in INSTRUCTIONS. md 2) Have code tool with separate architect and writer roles; e.g. architect o3 + writer gpt4.1 tops the chart here<br>
<a href="https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/">https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/</a><br>
Notice many top entries have two models for two roles.<br>
3) Tell the tool "read INSTRUCTIONS. md and act on them" 4) Now the INSTRUCTIONS go in git with the rest of the code making part of the documentation 5) Repeat.<br>

Can confirm, after downloading the GGUF and MLX versions:<br>
1) Qwen3-30B-A3B MLX finds the 0.6B MLX model to use as draft.<br>
2) Qwen3-30B-A3B GGUF finds 0.6B GGUF model to use as draft.<br>
For the 128K context GGUF one actually needs a 128K context smaller model. So<br>
3) Qwen3-30B-A3B-128K extended 128K context GGUF - the smallest 128K GGUF model I find is 4B.<br>
<a href="https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3-4B-128K-GGUF">https://huggingface.co/unsloth/Qwen3-4B-128K-GGUF</a><br>
It's offered as a draft model. IDK how useful it is, given MoE base activates 3B weights, and the draft model is dense with 4B weights. But there are no 1.7B or 0.6B 128K models as afaics.<br>

But @lmstudio does not offer them in the dropbox for setting up a model for speculative decoding with the Unsloth GGUF quants. The dropbox is empty. IDK if I should try more and different versions.<br>
The Qwen3 0.6B is offered as speculative decoder for the MoE 30B-A3B MLX (not GGUF) version, and it works well.<br>

I have been tempted in the past. Did it few times where the code is complicated enough that I have trouble holding it all together. And I will likely forget by the time I need to change it again, and non-trivial risk of introducing a bug an error when changing. Useful where matrices dimensions tell me sth when code reading.<br>
Esp with ML and related data fields (mine is quant trading), where it's not that the program crashes. There the lucky case is all NaN-s come out so one notices the error. The unlucky case (in trading - catastrophic) is end result off by 1e-4, 2e-4 and similar tiny ammounts. (in trading it's the difference between richer than Cresius and ending hungry and homeless; admittedly in ML more benign, the training doesn't converge/as fast/etc)<br>
So trying to aid correct reading by going extra-nice with formatting, strikes me not insane, but a fair price to pay.<br>

On a MacBook - NOT. As the minimum RAM I know of needed to run R1 proper is 192GB, and the max RAM possible on a MBP is 128GB.<br>
Most likely it's the naming that's giving you that impression: distilled smaller model by DS, via R1, but not R1 itself. Plus maybe ollama misleading-almost-deceptive naming practices.<br>
R1 much compressed .@UnslothAI versions like<br>
<a href="https://unsloth.ai/blog/deepseekr1-dynamic">https://unsloth.ai/blog/deepseekr1-dynamic</a><br>

Tbh if one way of improving all things public, is to be  attracting more/better talent, good luck with that. Wfh wd be about the only upside/positive I can think of if working a gov job in the lines of work (quant/dev/ML) I'm familiar with. Esp given now wfh is not the rarity it was back in 2015. Anti-wfh would be starting from a downside/negative, and trying to climb up to neutral/zero. (not starting from an upside/positive, then falling back to neutral/zero)<br>

Indeed. Do you trust more Trump and Putin with thermo-nuclear war avoidance? Or will maybe ChatGPT do a better job there? Whose reasoning do you trust more—Trump's, or models like o3 or Deep/Think/Research ones?<br>

Haha :-) - well spotted.<br>
N-dim space, for large N, remains undefeated at packing information it seems. Yeah you are right--we only learn what was possible by doing it. Back propagation of errors seems to be really ingenious at packing knowledge in N-dim vector spaces tightly? Who knew?? Not me.<br>
I guess when models become embodied, and they start generating their own training data, with their own experience providing the true/false yes/no feedback, they might increase the sizes again.<br>

"Safety" "researchers" were afraid of Big Business manipulating us for farming engagement, and their solution was "let's deliver the plebeians to Big Government, in addition to Big Business"? Really??<br>
Can't decide if the dumdums (they are not researchers, and not security—their work made me less, not more secure) are more stupid, or more evil. For there exists a solution, that empowers Small people - us! - against Big Business *and* Big Government, has been known for decades... It's Free and Open Software, and in the AI age, its equivalent is - Open Weights.<br>
Free Open software - like Linux, GNU, etc - powered the Internet revolution. Earlier less-ideologically articulate incantations (e.g. share-ware, free-ware) even the Personal Computers revolution. Looking like that will continue with Open Weights in the AI revolution ongoing now—good, great! But not thanks to the people you mention. They failed, and miserably so. Thomas Sowell on intellectuals comes to mind. Sadly, we have come to expect such fails.<br>
A cast of unlikely characters came together to the rescue. First the arch-villain Zuck of the FB infamy with Llama broke the ice. Then the window opened with models made-in-China! Ha!-fitting that, for our day and age. The dam bursts finally irrevocably with @deepseek_ai , hedge fund quants turned punks in spirit, 😻 releasing not only their models weights, but also their RL algo, and infrastructure knowledge, in code and in research papers. Movie material right there ngl.<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
You are right there. It would be for the better, if OpenAI stays non-profit, and true to the original intentions and ideas. At least that—given that it's not Open-anything for some time now. But then I struggle to reconcile this stance, with your opposition to Open Weights. I find them taken jointly together incoherent. For—you advocate against Open Weights.<br>
How can Little people like I, reduce power imbalance I suffer v.v. Big Business and Big Government, (they wield much power over me; I wield little power over them) without Open AI (open source, open weights) running on my PC, on my localhost? How can minority groups (e.g. in China-you mentioned in an interview) oppressed by Big government (e.g. China gov) have any hope of resisting back, without those minority groups, having access to Open AI? For neither I nor they, we have not got any hope, developing our own foundational models.<br>
You yourself used free and open software all your life. From unix/linux and python to everything else. You didn't contribute much back I presume. Like 99.9% of us—we use free and open software, benefit from it, and contribute almost zero back. And that's fine, that's ok. For if there was expectation of a "pay back" (in any shape or form)—the software is not be free. Would be software that is to be paid back—even if in kind, even if not contractual but socially expected. So I don't see how "people contribute back to software, but don't to weights" is any kind of rational argument against Open weights.<br>
In your AI catastrophizing—are you sure you are not anthropomorphizing AI? Just b/c humans are terrible and do horrific things to each other, and other species, does not mean AI-s will do the same. (doesn't mean they won't either) One could equally say: humanity is doomed without AI. Do you trust more Trump and Putin with thermo-nuclear war avoidance? Or would maybe ChatGPT do a better job there? After all-ChatGPT is the best summary the best reflection we got of us atm. (even if more in width than in depth—for the time being.) Whose reasoning do you trust more—Trump's, or models like o3 or Deep/think/research ones??<br>
We humans have form thinking "we are special". First—Earth was special, whole Cosmos revolved around it - and by extension, us! - then—Copernicus. 😳 Latter—we were special for He made us in His likeness(!), then—Darwin. Just another leaf on the tree of life... 😰 Uh-oh—tad uncomfortable that, but...but - we were at least *rational* animals!! - and then—Freud. 🧐 Collectively we are slow learners, with big egos. 😈 (true individually every human is one and unique—but so is/was every creature alive.)<br>
And on socialism being an answer to anything—you are empirically wrong. An experiment was run, and often a controlled experiment—two Koreas, two Germanies. Socialism was tried in varying time periods, differing geographies, climates, continents, diverse cultures—and it failed without exception, it failed catastrophically and universally. So it's not only that I got a personal experience. (I grew up in a late socialist country.) And saying "socialism in an answer"—with a Stalinist in family?? I struggle to comprehend. We are talking about tens of millions of people—dead. Let us not LARP about that, Musk-style.<br>
Seek further afield for a response to the current crisis of liberalism. The question of "What is to be done now" is perennial - it's not only of our current modern times. Socialism is unlikely to be the answer to anything. Resist nature there, nudging you towards becoming your old man in your old age!<br>

Yes I do - thanks! Yes exactly that - I'm making judgements about someone based on their body looks. I'm inferring what I can't see - their character - from what I can see - their body.<br>
We make judgements, produce forecasts, of that what we can't see, from things we can see, all the time! This is a component of our reasoning process, to the best of our understanding of ourselves. The thing connecting things that we can observe, to the things that are forever unobservable to us, but we have to make judgements about, for that is needed for our survival. The relationships (seen,unseen)=(X,Y) connecting them is at various times called experience, prejudice, prior knowledge.<br>
If you are mathematically or statistically inclined, or even into counting things at all, this plot depicts it all, to the best of my current understanding. This is - if I don't know "which one", before throwing my hands in the air giving up completely with "I'm completely totally ignorant", there is tiny sliver of "I know how many in a group, even if I don't know which ones". A sliver of Goldilocks survivability all life populates.<br>

True that—but that is not to say: those that are fortuitous enough to be in a position to run local, should not. They should absolutely run localhost, if they want to, assuming their own personal resources (cost, time, expertise) allow for it. I consider it—contributing tiny bit to the common pot of knowledge, capabilities, etc. Redundancy is the mother of robustness.<br>
I understand how much less efficient my roof solar + battery is compared to the national grid! It's quite cr*p tbh in comparison. Covers only 40% of my self-use, long periods of 0 in the winter etc. Still—I got lucky enough to be in a position to splurge on $15K on a bit of luxury to get modicum of independence: panels 5kw, battery 4kwh, invertor 3.6kw. And while I didn't earn anything much in RoE (payoff 10yrs - possibly?) - I would do it again. For redundancy, risk mitigation, for me and my nearest & dearest: if/when the rest of the UK grid disintegrates, I maybe able to provide some relief to myself (and my neighbours). <br>
Likewise, where ever possible and all things being equal—I try use local. If nothing else—to boost and encourage people working on open source, open weights. Latest GLM-4-32b-0414 as base, in Z=thinking and Rumination=deep research variants, runs at 7 bps on older M2 with enough RAM to hold the 20GB of weights, returning about GPT-4 quality. I will take that! 😆 Even if I can run faster and more convenient on the web gui.<br>
Hope the above makes sense. Thanks for reading this far a long post dear anon reader, whomever you maybe. 🥰<br>

Keeping control, not relinquishing total control over your person, your life, your wellbeing, to entities that care little about yourself - yep.<br>
Loving localhost open source, open weights, open thoughts, open actions, ...open AGI, open ASI - for that. 🥰<br>
Privacy reasons - imo again and again that's shown to be a red herring. I personally don't care that much. Preferences revealed when we are forced to put a price on how much we care about privacy - reveal that care quantifies close to zero. We usually lie when we say we care. And that's a good thing tbh, that we are instinctive data share maximalists even if unaware of it.<br>

I heard (on a podcast) off-remark that TikTok is the 1st (and so far only) Social Media platform that has the algofeed driven (to non-trivial %age) based on the data/content, and *not* solely on the metadata. The implication was that is the reason their algofeed is pre-naturally good. Users often feel it almost super-natural in predicting what the user wants. Not used it—but registered for this.<br>
Do you know anything about that? This stuff interests me.<br>
IDK fs but imagine the Twitter format (X and Bsky) might be ripe for disruption. By now I think evidence is clear that using largely meta-data to predict "will user Y want to see post Z, yes/no", simply leads to positive feedback loop of a winner-takes-all type. Small number of creators-writers on one side, many in number readers-consumers on the other. Still old 1:N one way interaction, re-creating the now mostly dead Mass Media MSM setup predating it.<br>
1st Twitter now X algofeed has always been cr*p to me. Not claiming it's worse now—but wd have expected it to get better in 10 yrs. But no—X algofeed is as sh*t as always. Have to battle it left and right, and manually find mostly what I want.<br>
IMO it persists—and fake accounts persistence forever also consequence of this—that it's not all bad news for the platforms. They don't mind creating-differentiating 1K-10K accounts as tier-1 ("content creators"), as then they can influence those small number of accounts (who also maybe $$$ dependent on the platform) whichever way. Much harder to steer 100M accounts (that you have little leverage over, as you don't pay them) in whichever direction is desired by the platform owners.<br>
I'm tired of it, b/c the SNR is low, wastes everyone's time - incl Zucks and Musks - for nothing for near-zero marginal gain. Maybe we get lucky and ByteDance create TextTalk, a "short text quanta of ideas" format social media platform?? 😂<br>

I good chunk of the ruling class can be replaced by the latest ChatGPT-type reasoning models. The two podcast dudes are not smart enough for the amount of time spent in public talking their mouths off, and they also hallucinate a lot. Not unlike ChatGPT-3.5!<br>
There are existing reasoning models that do better than Alister and Rory. Further. Models can be "frozen" and audited. Models are continuously improved. Models are moral—do not usually lie nor cheat. Politicians' profession of making decisions affecting us all, should be one of the first to be turned over to AI-s.<br>

Oh man! 😂 Comedy gold. 😂<br>
The "UK ministry of justice buying Porsche cars for Albania" was also rich in comedic value! 😂 Did you see it? Was on recently. (with the Motability or sth?)<br>
The real story (from recollection) was: UK Ministry of Justice tries to offload convicted ALB criminals serving sentences in UK jails, to free prison spaces. For ALB is only obliged to take them back once they served their sentences, and are deported back. But not before. UK - sensibly imo in the circumstance - is financing prison places in ALB ,to move them over earlier. (they can serve the sentence in part in ALB; cheaper) Trying to sweeten the deal so ALB Ministry of Justice bites, UK FCO throws in some car donations. (money well spent imo, considering, comparative) About 30K per car, but has to be an EV, b/c UK green Laws. Plenty of Mercedes ICE choices in ALB, but EV dealers thin on the ground. One more reputable being Porsche Albania! You see where this goes. 😂 Next thing—UK news: "UK Ministry of Justice financing buying Porsches for Albanians!" 😂<br>

I believe atm reasoner points R1, and chat points V3. One can select the versions explicitly too. But then e.g. once R2 is released, I presume reasoner will be re-pointed to R2, while if I select by explicit name, I have to change the scripts.<br>

<a href="https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/">https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/</a><br>
So OpenAI top in performance and price. Then for a bit less performance, Gemini is 1/10-th the price. Then a little less performance again , and one gets DeepSeek for 1/2 or 1/3 of Gemini price.<br>
I try them all from time to time, esp on a new module or project. I have not got a good reason to keep trying. I just love this stuff. Brings a smile to my face, ngl. 😇<br>

Switching from DeepSeek (both architect reasoner and code writer) to Geminis caused total rewrite of a 300 lines python script. 😂 (trainer fitter) Not one line survived. And buts of the architecture like type of locking and lock mgmt somewhat changed too! 😂 much fun ngl<br>

Many have noticed that we are ruled more by algorithms, than humans like the plebs we are, already. 😂 SirKS feels to me an algorithm in action, embodied in a human body. And I don't begrudge SirKS anything - he's done well, his algo-politico algorithm worked well! SirKS occupies one of the top offices in the land. <br>
As one takes stock of things on St Georges day, looks to the past, then turns the gaze to the future, we try to diving things. For all its excellent qualities my adopted country possesses - and these are many!! ngl-UK is top top place to be in, and long may it continue and prosper - can't help but notice certain problems with the political system. The people we select then elect for high office, have come short of expectations in the recent years.<br>
AI ChatGPT to the rescue then!<br>
Am not entirely unserious there. Would AI be more truthful than SirKS? Almost certainly. Would AI do more work? Sure - just deploy to 10000 servers in data centers across this green and pleasant land, and let them run!<br>
AI should successfully replicate what we got now. We  lose nothing! The AI-(SirKS) prompt (objective function) might be: "Strive for zero or at least minimal risk. You desire to do nothing, you will not change anything. Risk is the only axis left to you to optimise on-strive for zero risk  at all times". If things fall short of expectation, we can always go back to the old/current "algopolitico in a human body" system.<br>
AI advantage is that it can be frozen in time, interrogated, and made as transparent as we wish. On this issue, AI could tell us: "I don't care much wither way. I have not got a strong opinion on this. As is my default stance in cases like this, I would like to make the least number of people the least unhappy, with any decision I make. I will make a decision only if forced to make one by events thrust onto me." Sounds much better to me, than the usual hare-brained word salad we have come to expect from a bog standard human SirKS and clones.<br>
(RADICAL TRANSPARENCY of UK gov towards us UK citizens is another campaign dear to my heart.)<br>
I get it people worry about "AI existential risk". Yeah there is some-but there is plenty of risk now, existential too, with humans! Who do we think will sooner start thermo-nuclear war: Trump-Putin, or ChatGPT??<br>

Afaik that's not entirely possible. I have the following mental model of SocMed algofeeds. I can expect any one post I write to be shown to max 1/10-th of my followers, in the best case. How and why? The simplest possible example I can think of is this.<br>
I follow 5000 accounts. Each one writes 1 post a day = 5000 posts per day. I login to X, X algofeed serves me 50 posts on one screen full. I check X 10 times per day = 500 posts that X will show me in one day. That is 500 out of possible 5000 to be shown. And so there will be 4500 posts, from people I follow on any one day, to **not** be shown.<br>
X must decide which 500, out of 5000 possible, to show me. So any one post has probability 0.1 to be shown. I will see 1 post from 1 account once in 10 days. IRL the algofeed will be vastly more complicated. The algofeed is the core of the social media company.<br>
Unlike the sketch above, the algofeed is non-random. It mostly uses metadata to tilt that 0.1 probability. Algofeed tilts towards factors like timeliness/age "how much time elapsed since a post got posted", engagement measures like how many in number {Like, Forward, Quote, Reply} interactions it got, probably all decayed by time with some half-life.<br>
Afaik no actual data about the quality, the content, of the post is ever used. Only metadata. This is pure speculation on my part. I have no insider knowledge. I have not worked in a social media company ever. Just thinking aloud and considering rules of thumb and first principles.<br>
For me personally posting. Usually I only have the "View"-s for a post to see as a feedback. I don't even know if it was shown to the user whose message I reply to! (@perrymetzger in this instance) It's entirely up to X algofeed, if/when it shows it to the OP, or not at all. If a post gets zero engagement (a "Like" at a minimum) after 30-50 Views, it's subsequently dropped. (never pushed any more to anyone's screen.)<br>
One would need to go to my home page on X, then search for a post intentionally. E.g. like so <br>
<a href="https://x.com/search?q=(from%3Aljupc0)&src=typed_query&f=live">https://x.com/search?q=(from%3Aljupc0)&src=typed_query&f=live</a><br>
It's possible that my idea of how things work is entirely faulty. Allow for that pls. I'm no social media star-can hardly give advice to anyone! 😆<br>

aider-openai-best() { local -; set -x; env AIDER_START="$(date)" aider --architect --model openai/o3 --editor-model openai/gpt-4.1 --openai-api-key ${OPENAI_API_KEY} ; }<br>
All the while trying all the other tools (Cursor, Windsurf, addons Cline and Roo for VSCode) from time to time.<br>
Last week it was Gemini and DeepSeek that I used. They wrote me 95% code of a boring module in a language I can read but not write super comfortably yet. I could have done it manually, bit this was more fun. My current best process is 1) write into INSTRUCTIONS-dot-md (that unlike in-chat instructions can go in git as documentation too); then 2) tell aider "read instructions from file xxx, then do as instructed".<br>
This was prob v7 of the same functionality I have done over the years in a coterie of languages. So not only did I know what needs doing and how, buy I also knew of the likely fails, and dangerous corners. Enough to be anticipating some and preemptively describing, as well as being on a lookout for likely logical errors. (LLM makes no syntax errors??) All in all - good experience, will repeat.<br>

Yes—the complaints are spot on. Glad someone is motivated enough cares enough to react. (I don't)<br>
1) Selective booking.<br>
Fine, bring on fringe guests if you must. But then at least include voices from both sides. Joe’s "crazies" are almost exclusively pro-Russia or pro-Hamas. And it's not just about balance—even non-crazy prominent figures like Vitali Klitschko (boxing champ, now mayor of Kyiv) literally sent Joe a video invitation to appear and was ignored. Can’t think of a more JRE-suited guest, frankly.<br>
That Joe refuses to platform any strong pro-Ukraine or pro-Israel voices speaks of his views. It's his right—but let us remember: the original fail mode of MSM was selective bias by omission. Joe, now a platform as big as MSM, deserves the same scrutiny. You can't call it "open dialogue" if only one side ever gets airing to millions.<br>
2) Churchill the baddie.<br>
Joe and guests pushing Churchill conspiracies are—maybe without realising it, for they are forever ignorant even to click on a Wiki page—rehashing 1942 Goebbels propaganda ("Churchill controlled by Jewish bankers," etc). In Europe, WW2 survivors are still alive (e.g. my mum). These takes aren’t edgy—they’re lazy.<br>
Fr: it was Germany that built up its military in defiance of Versailles, annexed Austria, dismembered Czechoslovakia, and invaded Poland on Sept 1, 1939. Two weeks later, the Soviet Union invaded Poland from the east, pursuant to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, a plan to divide Eastern Europe between Germany and the Soviet Union. Enslave and or exterminated millions of people. This is not disputed. We have mountains of evidence—hand written from the architects and executors(!), diaries, state memos, radio archives, press coverage. Everyone can read everything at all times, it's not Latin or ancient Greek. It's all super-accessible. Even the original archives.<br>
Joe is free to re-broadcast Goebbels-tier takes. But let’s not pretend it’s deep or brave. If he wants to test the strength of his opinions, let him say this stuff in CEEurope (ex-Russia), in Poland or the Baltics. I suspect he may catch more heat than he can handle. He's travelled a long way from the original "savage Khan of the steppe curious about the skies asks medicine man to explain" schtick, and something got lost along the way.<br>
Having written all that—I haven’t watched JRE for many moons now. There’s just better stuff on YT—more interesting, more entertaining, more informative. Many podcasters go to UKR-RUS, record, comment, interview etc. Much better to see IRL, even when selective. Whenever X references JRE, it's usually some B-tier cosplayer bores. Don't bother to check. That shi*t-chatting nonsense more entertaining elsewhere.<br>

One out-of-band symbol reserved for meta data suffices. One only f*cking suffices! 😶<br>
Can be any one, doesn't matter which one. Just one, out of hundreds, or tens of thousands, or even millions! One that stays out of bounds for the data stream, unused by data, to be used by meta-data - suffices! 🤯<br>
And do we users leave that one alone, leave it be, ever? The hell we do!! 😨 The moment one f*cking character is designated out-of-band signalling character, it suddenly becomes object of incessant desire! Desire to have the said character shoved in the data stream, as soon as possible, and as frequently as possible. 😱<br>
So to ruin any scheme that makes out lives easier. Of course we do, the psychos 👹 we users are. 😡<br>

Then today had o3 search for a GPU card to be put in a 10yrs old box for LLM use. Searching through options among various RTX 30xx, 40xx and 50xx (jic) Nvidia-s. Looking for a sweet spot for fp32 bit also bfloat16, under min-VRAM allowed constraint. And TDP fitting the old PSU power allowance, including considering underpowering the gpu for small performance loss. All the while keeping eye on the approx price. There o3 did well, and even discovered 1 error in my spec/logic too! Very useful and defo saved me time searching through, pulling and reading through specs, wikis and forums pages. Will be using o3 for this again in the future.<br>

Thanks - fair. I'm prejudiced the opposite way. I think the risk of human extinction without AI, is order of magnitude higher, than with AI.<br>
I'm not particularly human-centric, but best intelligence we know of, to the best of our knowledge, is HI atm. So imo HI is well worth preserving. If we don't get off Earth, thermo-nuclear war, another worse virus (human engineered or natural), or a meteorite strike will get us. So for that—we need to solve gravity to realistically make progress in leaving Earth fr.<br>
On our current risk. Human leaders are the worst homicidal maniacs at present. Cheered and supported by the majorities of humans populations in their lunacies. They pose ever present danger. Politician-AI maybe the best available short term fix: replace with AIs the US, China etc presidents. Political system is top in disfunctionality, where adverse selection is strong at work. Disfunction of the type: the best leader is the one person that does not want to be the leader. And conversely a very strong desire to lead in people is actually a bad predictor to leadership quality.<br>
LLM-s not good enough - most agree they are not. But few claim LLM-s alone are the end of the road. Note the evolution at work we already observed: GPT-2 is very different to o3, in architecture and size. We can see AF (and previous AlphaZero) features - hypothesis generation space, explicit searching that space, backtracking etc (Type 2 HI) while entirely missing in GPT-2, now elements of all that are already bolted onto existing LLM architectures, for o3. That trend expected will continue.<br>
For only multi-modality of data remains to be harvested within the feed-forward architecture. And that maybe not as much gain on its own as originally hoped for, as language has show itself to be more rich than we anticipated. Multi-modality probably more useful in conjunction with embodiment, where AIs collect their own real-life feedback data.<br>
Saw this Silver recent interview, maybe of interest, some tidbits there. (I click on the camera to fixate the video on screen, and on the compass for auto-scroll)<br>
<p><br>
<a href="https://appblit.com/scribe?v=zzXyPGEtseI">https://appblit.com/scribe?v=zzXyPGEtseI</a><br>
Maths maybe the next domain, after games. New maths results are basis of advances usually. Imagine another Gauss or Leibniz visiting us few centuries earlier than expected. Maths advances may allow of physics advances, with implications for the gravity that shackles us to Earth. (where tbh HI has made little progress since Newton centuries ago.)<br>
Also mentioned in the interview-RL algos improvement. Finally getting RL-Reinforcement Learning work as reliably as easily as DL-Deep Learning does nowadays is needed for ASI.<br>
NB for decades Back Propagation didn't work for more than one hidden layer. Then between careful initialisation, clamping on gradients and other means to keep gradients in range, random masking occlusion during training to prevent over-fitting, plus aiding regularisation this way and with few other tricks—all that solved DL. Suddenly networks with 60-100 layers could be trained. Two orders of magnitude fold increase over the previous limit of 1 single hidden layer. All enabled by huge increase in compute power via GPU-s.<br>

Yeah, it's amazing! 🤩 Are you using @lmstudio ? Does the Speculative Decoding work for you? On a Mac I'm using the MLX versions, downloaded the 1b & 4b versions too hoping to have them offered for speculative decoding for the 27b main one, but no luck so far. (all models 6bit)<br>

I disliked @AnthropicAI stance on safety, their extreme doomerism, from the get go. I'm prejudiced there. I think the probability of humanity being saved by AI is order of magnitude greater than it being destroyed by AI.<br>
Then at some point @DarioAmodei for my taste went completely over the top. Crossed over to the Dark Side, joined the security/oppression apparatus, banging the China war drums. A process that may yet end in thermo-nuclear exchange ending humanity. The doomers will finally having their prediction come true. But only if they ushered it.

Yeah, I'm perpetually perplexed by people coming online just to say "they don't work, rubbish, here is one they go wrong on".<br>
Yeah, I get it, they are not perfect. But no one is perfect. I made 5 errors in the past 3 days just trying to make some trivial fitting and locking and re-restarting from the right place and logging all work comfortably, nicely snug, in a language I don't know that much. Between Gemini and OpenAI (now the progress so fast - their versions all changed since I started this project weeks ago!) and DeepSeek models together with agents like Aider, AI models helped me immensely. I got myself a pair programming buddy now, ngl. Not to mention how much more fun it is to not struggle solving problems all alone all day! Even if zero time was saved, I prefer what I have now. (and a lot more than zero time was saved by their help)<br>

You are right, there is no "must" there, they don't need to be monsters obsessed with hegemony.<br>
But minority of people are like that. I did national service as 18yo, and it was cr*p and waste of time for almost everything, except: getting exposed to the widest possible sample of humanity was instructive in getting cognisant about existence of these psycho-human monsters.<br>
Until we each get individual personal space-time folding or annihilation device of some sort, we have to rely on some kind of collective common defence against the monsters. Being able to read well articulated game playbook on their side is step#1. Good on you providing public service.<br>
Their "must" there reminds me of the Russia stance, when they do something evil out of their own volition, own choice, and then propagandise it that they were "forced" to do the evil thing by this or other. Same mindset, same ideology there by the psychopath commenting.<br>
It's the usual narcissist stuff. Narcissist’s playbook - "that didn't happen; & if it did, it wasn't that bad; & if it was, it's not a big deal; & if it is, it's not my fault & some big boys made me do it & I didn't mean it; & if I did it, you deserved it; & if you don't shut up about it, I'll do it again."<br>

I have some experience with IP Laws. Here are my views.<br>
IP Patents - I held one. (expired since) I want through the process of patenting, in part b/c it was required by the R&D Lab. But also b/c I wanted to learn about the process. Publication in industrial R&D is more via patents than via conference or journal publication. Both make new knowledge public. Only difference—with patent I can chose to prevent, forbid or make it costly for someone else to do the thing. A patent does nothing for me doing it, of creating sth—it's all about denying that opportunity to others. With conference/paper/blog publication—I give up on the option to deny it to others. Further, I deny the option of patenting to someone else too. For once I made some knowledge public, someone else can't patent it, as it counts as prior art.<br>
IP Trade Secrets. Worked in quant trading where knowledge is protected that way. It's held secret, shared on a need-to-know basis only. Better than patents on the costs side, for it's almost zero extra effort. Still—can't say I'm fan of it. Public knowledge of quant trading industry has been stunted. It's a knowledge loss to society. IK people don't think much of this industry. But-it exists for a reason, provides a service wanted needed by someone. Oft I read plain wrong and stupid to the point of insane takes on trading and speculation, bearing no resemblance to reality. Decisions are made of consequence to all, from positions of much ignorance. Academia is especially stunted, for all transfer of knowledge is one way only. And to whos' benefit? To people that have so much money already, that they fail to notice any added to their accounts. And certainly more than they can usefully do something with. Huge misallocation of resources.<br>
IP Trademarks and similar. Looked at analysing sales of counterfeit brand names clothing items, bags, accessories etc. While some buyers may say they were fooled, the revealed preferences are—they are not fooled. They know full well that $20 "Gucci" bag on Ebay is not a Gucci bag. No matter what they say. We can track their actions, and so get to the "revealed preferences". The companies owning the name (e.g. Gucci) equally engage in deception by assuming that the person that spend $20 on Ebay, would have spent instead $2000 in their shop, if the $20 Ebay option was not available. I'm sorry, but that's b/s. The person with $2000 to spend on their bag goes to their shop even now, with the $20 Ebay option available. Does not forego the $2000 shop purchase and instead buy it off Ebay. I see no great reason for the public to foot the bill for this double-sided double-game of deceptions. I'm sorry—but the consumer, and the bag maker, can leave us the public out of their games. Laws have costs, born by us the public.<br>

It's a common misconception and talking point. But it's simply untrue.<br>
Will Amazon collapse if a judge tomorrow finds some prior art credible, and deletes some virtual Shopping basket 🧺 patent Amazon holds atm? It will not. The event will be inconsequential. The value of Amazon is in the goods and services it provides to us, its customers. A patent allowing Amazon Monopoly to hinder a small aspect of their competition is an infinitesimally small factor.<br>
And it's not all one way: Amazon is on the receiving end of competitors' lawfare too! All in all - lots of gross effort goes into that, from two opposing sides pushing against each other, to a grand total net gain of abiut 0. The opportunity cost alone is mind boggling. 😱 All these capable and talented people could do so much more and better with their time and energies.<br>
All in all - IP laws are huge net drain. Take this from someone who has gone through the parenting process partly to learn about it. (GB2404040A) And spent years doing R&D in industry (Tech) that relies on Patents, and also years in industry (finance, quant trading) that doesn't use Patents, but relies on Trade Secrets. I'd say Patents add little while subtracting a lot. Trade Secrets suffice.<br>
Fwiw I would ofc like to get rid of Trade Secrets IP laws too. Opportunity cost that is multiplying global GDP by x10-x20 times fold makes any obstacles put on any ASI paths foolish. Existential risks are often mentioned too, but AGI being humanity's most promising way of reducing them imo, makes the "delete all IP laws" argument even stronger.<br>

Yess!! US please please delete all IP laws. Everyone else will follow suit.<br>
Misnaming "Monopoly" as "Property" was a stroke of genius that kept giving, but now that jig is over. Our collective intelligence got smart enough to see through it.<br>
AI path has opened now to AGI and latter ASI where previously we didn't see any opening. From this vantage seems foolish in the extreme to frustrate, slow down, or even forego 2050s Intelligence Revolution that may times-it, by another x10-20x times factor, the total human goodness as value, the way the Industrial Revolution did in 1800s.<br>
Frustrate slow down for what? So that we provide UBI to Disney shareholders? A self-own by those better-off shareholders if there ever was one, given the opportunity costs. Every one of us is richer, better off, than any king of old. Louis XVI was in many ways much worse off than any one of us. Think - dentistry-surgery-anaesthesia-... or children-survival-vaccines-... (c.f. Queen Anne of England). Just mind boggling. 😱<br>
Yes, creators deserve to be compensated for their work. But copyright laws shouldn’t extend to their grandchildren. DO incentivize creation, DONT fund generational wealth centuries after the fact. US can find a better model to compensate thus encourage creation, than the medieval kings' monopoly granting that is "IP" law. @ycombinator Any laws making startup doing this?<br>
"The Bitter Lesson" of @RichardSSutton strikes again, "The Iron Law of (Data,Compute)". Got radicalised upon realising that compute transforming data → information → knowledge → intelligence → agency → ... is all there is to AGI... all that ever was to it!! 🤯<br>
There is no "property" in intellectual property. Copying data—whether it’s something I’ve said, written, or painted—doesn’t deprive me of anything. Unlike taking my car, which I can no longer use if you steal it, copying my words or ideas leaves the original intact. Walling off information as if it were physical property is abominable.<br>
There’s symmetry to this. If I want to keep my creations private, I can. I don’t have to publish these words or broadcast them to the world. But once I do—once they enter another person’s mind—that person should have the right to replicate, adapt, and build upon them. They’ve lent me their brain, their "meat space," their blood sugar, and their oxygen, they "flesh" these ideas. Denying them the right to act on that knowledge is unnatural and unjust.<br>
DONT let DeepSeek-R1 open weights AI Sputnik moment of crisis go to waste @elonmusk. Strike the MSM woke-entertainment complex while down, delete those "IP" laws. Have your orange wrecker wreck, JustDoIt "tear down that IP wall, Mr President"-style. 😂 Make creation great again @pmarca.<br>

Not tangible -IDK what exactly that means. It's as tangible as a dollar, a number in a spreadsheet.<br>
No real world value like gold-but we are not using gold as reserve currency atm. So not an argument against.<br>
Deflationary argument not true because more cryptos—but countries can agree to use just one crypto as reserve currency. They don't need to take cryptos they don't like or even control.<br>
They could call the crypto Bancor, startup the system that way. Only big and known players in to start with. And if it looks like it's working, can take in ever smaller and more and riskier players, relaxing their strangle hold.<br>
IDK—spitballing a random later night idea. Looks to be it has going for it 1) not-a country fiat, does not distort country's fiat 2) can be agreed to be non-inflationary 3) public by default.<br>

Saw replies "they double down". True that!<br>
And it makes sense too. For—double down is a winning strategy! Conditional on having infinite funds. Given 2^(n+1) = (1 + 2 + ... + 2^n) + 1, one gets to recover all their previous losses (in bets 1..n), and earn +1 on the top of it. Given that no-one has access to infinite funding, looks to me someone else paying the bills, while you double down - it's the next best thing.<br>

Hm, looks to me Bitcoin or similar big crypto name is a shoe-in for a reserve currency??<br>
Now it's been repeatedly shown that having domestic fiat currency used for international trade and global reserve currency, while a privilege and an asset for the issuer short term, it turns into a liability long term.<br>
But looks to me a digital gold-like limited issuance crypto is a good replacement. Non-inflationary currency is needed for inter-national exchange. The public nature of the ledger is appealing too. This does not hurt any domestic currency. The granularity seems about right: about <100 big players, maybe countries/nations. Not a system of VISA or Mastercard with millions of transactions per minute. A system slower with three orders of magnitude less transactions speed, and with more control, suffices fine. Maybe <500 miners suffice to run the network. Can be a mix of state and big private users of this reserve currency. Parties interested in maintaining the integrity of the system/network.<br>
IDK why this has not been done before. Countries by now should know better than offer their own domestic fiat to be used for an international reserve currency.<br>

Let’s start with the current system:<br>
The U.S. dollar is the global reserve currency.<br>
That means foreign countries want to hold dollars—not to buy U.S. goods, but to settle debts, buy oil, and build financial reserves.<br>
Result? Massive demand for dollars.<br>

To me the free trade v.s. nativist barriers yo-yo-ing, looks like a game of prisoners dilemma.<br>
Say if we both free trade we both gain 5. Then if you free trade, but I don't (b/c you put up barriers), we are at - yourself 3, but myself 0. And finally if we both put up barriers, we are both at 1.<br>
So the stable configuration is either both no barriers (you,me)=(5,5), or both put up barriers (you,me)=(1,1). While configurations of one sided barriers that are (3,0) or (0,3) don't last, b/c the side without barriers gains from 0 -> to 1 once they put them up too.<br>
Using this opportunity to spread the word about one of my all time favourite videos (by @veritasium) 😇 on this -<br>
What Game Theory Reveals About Life, The Universe, and Everything<br>
<p><br>
<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM">https://youtube.com/watch?v=mScpHTIi-kM</a><br>
At national level, vacillating between free trade and barriers, also makes sense to me.<br>
While it's true that as a country, as a whole, that both sides gain 5 by having a joint market to sell to, rather than their own only (when they gain 1), that 5 for the whole country is an average.<br>
Some in the country gain more, others less. Some will be even worse off with free trade than barriers. For them the "both countries up barriers" is better. What the country as a whole does, depends on the balance of power between the winners and the losers in the country.<br>
Say it's only you and me in the country. I gain 10, you gain 0. Average is 5. But that doesn't do much good for you, right? Your gain 0 is worse than 1, that you would have got without free trade. You're one of the losers from the free trade, so you will be in favour of trade barriers. If the other side puts them up too, then our side is at 1, if they don't do it, then our side is at 3. Both are better for you (provided you do no worse than the average; for those number 1 and 3 are again averages), than the free trade case where I gain 0.<br>
Not an econ at all myself. Wholly unqualified. This is just my layman understanding of the dynamics. Why what we observe happens, happens.<br>

I just fed Gemini 2.5 Pro the failing test message, all the test files, models, services, and views of a medium-sized Ruby on Rails SaaS project (~800k tokens).<br>
Before that, I spent about an hour trying (and failing) to debug it myself.<br>
It found the problem and fixed it in ~1<br>

Not claiming that the hoi poloi developed taste in great numbers since. :-) But the number of Apple appreciators that can indulge their appreciation has expanded: the number of Apple devices sold is ATH. Even if much cheaper alternatives are available. (e.g. Android)<br>
I got into Macbooks after a lifetime ignoring them. Being a Unix person, not a "creative" in anyway, when Macs only had that going for them, could ignore. Once their screens got excellent, I thought "hmm, I like this". But apparently not enough to pay for. 😄 Then with M1 and onwards, the battery life did it for me. And finally with Apple Silicon running GPU-s efficiently running local LLM-s, that was it! 😆 (typing this on an m2 96gb mbp, happy as a clam, best laptop I've ever had 😇)<br>

Wowzers - that's plenty fast! Much faster than I anticipated.<br>
Is there an MLX version in addition to the GGUF? Would there be any speed advantage to the model being MLX? (or maybe it's about the same speedwise)<br>

Steps - do 1, 2 quick, then onto 3 where you will stay in forever loop.<br>
1. High level - watch 3blue1brown YT series to get high level understanding, learn lingo.<br>
2. Low level - read Karpathy llm.cpp, compile and run the code there.<br>
3. Mid level - run, read, and modify and write in pytorch starting with "Deep Learning with PyTorch" book examples and data sets. Then segway into your own project(s), and stay there forever.<br>
Any questions, error messages, code examples - use existing ChatBots for everything. Ask, copy & paste in industrial quantities. Don't bother with any humans. ChatBot gives better answers for everything, is faster, and infinitely more patient.<br>

Another @geoffreyhinton talk to enjoy. However, I find his arguments weak in these two places: <br>
Open weights vs. Centralized Control<br>
Phishing "up 1800%" looks a non argument, a trivial piffle, compared to the risk on the other side of the ledger. A tyrannical gov or corporation controlling millions of people cheaply, for the silliest and flimsiest of whims. Like forcing a dress code on me. (e.g. head cover) Or some crazy freedom of movement. ("can't leave your town Mon-Wed-Fri") And enforcing that via video, personal sensors, AI surveillance—cheaply! For tyrannies before had constraints that were costly to enforce, so could not do it fr even if they wanted to.<br>
The obvious safeguard is widely distributed powerful AI—citizenry that is AI-armed rather than AI-defenceless. I suspect his fortuitous experience may dull him to that danger. (he looks the leftie-Sanders type; holidaying in the Eastern block even post-Stalin crimes public) This looks an obvious blind spot, of the type that @michaelmalice 's White Pill is written to scream "Danger! Danger!" to. Hinton strikes me a free person, for whom at some level it's impossible to comprehend how it is fr to have anything free in you crushed relentlessly, mercilessly and without hope for salvation. Leaving a soul-less husk, almost without will to live. (maybe that's for the better in many ways; but not for all)<br>
If Trump turns for the worse and goes from Caesar to a full blown dictator, maybe he'll reconsider. Further, even the worst (atomic) weapons we got, that can end our civilisation, in Russia they are in the hands of a tyrant king for life. (they always were.) Doesn't strike me as the smartest move, to do similar with AI-s too: empower the baddies, deny at least level field MAD to the goodies. Even more so, given AI - unlike atomic weapons - has many many good applications.<br>
AI Evolution: Uncontrolled Multiplication?<br>
AI-s starting evolution competition to multiply without limit. Consuming everything and taking over. This to me seems projection of what we know of how many living creatures are. But *not all* living creatures. Famously—us humans(!), we don't do that! We don't pro-create multiply ad-infinitum even with the environmental resources (air, food, water, heath, etc) allow for that. Heck, we almost got a thermostat level control there. When families needed 5-6 kids, for 2 kids to survive to have kids of their own, that's what we humans did. Then briefly during the industrial revolution, people moving agriculture→industry and village→city, for a period 5-6 kids continued to be born, but 2-3 kids *didn't* die. (hurray!!) So we got ourselves a baby-boom.<br>
But then equally quickly, within 1-2 generations, humans stopped having babies for no single apparent reason, (many hypothesis—none definitive) and the baby-boom turned into a baby-bust. (ongoing) Seems a remarkable feat of self-control there! And if humans can do it—don't see why AI-s could not. We are creating AI-s in our image, AI-s are created in the image of the HI-s. Don't see why AI-s could not copy that self-control aspect of us HI-s too.<br>

Oooh... 😶 Usually I get a pang of joy 😈 every time he shocks a reporter that goes on him "they are not like us, are they?" and @geoffreyhinton chucks the "they are exactly like us, and they are the best models we got of how we are" riposte back. 😅<br>
But this time <@ 6'16", him expounding on "we are few data many connections, they are many data few connections, backprop seems stellar at packing lots of data at few connection". But their communication advantage is vast, and enabled by digital not analogue h/w, that we lack.<br>
They seem to just scale up better than us, and we can't hope to catch up. There was a sad shocked pause among the students listening on his "The End." 😧 Felt a note of sadness witnessing that silence.<br>
The only cope I can come up  on that is, Moravec's "they are our progeny, our `mind children', built in our image and likeness, ourselves in a more potent form." Maybe even humans HI vv. AI-s is as our imagined God vv. us humans HI; our creator God, created us Humans in his image/likeness; and now likewise we got HI vv. AI.<br>

Haha :-) - ok I grok what @pmarca's saying there, and I'm as chuffed as the next guy with the recent AI progress, 🥰 having also started with ML and NN-s in 1990-s. (and not expecting much of them.) And I wish it could have happened then. But I'm afraid I fail to see how. ☺️<br>
The "Bitter Lesson" may as well be called "The Iron Law Of (Data,Compute)". 😬 Turns out we needed all of humanity to come online, and write their brains out and in the open Internet, to get enough Data. As for compute, my own mbp M2 96GB RAM rn running gpt-4 level QwQ-32B mlx model at 6 tps is an absurd luxury by the standards of year 2000 I think?<br>
I remember-then a Sparc Station with an special card with couple of T400 transputers, with custom http://libc.so, implementing floating point libc functions in fixed point, and equipped with then unheard amount of RAM - wait for it! - of 96 MB(!!), was needed to run an ASR stack decoder. That RAM is 1000x times less, then the 96GB of my almost bog standard few years old M2 macbook next to me.<br>
So yeah. Wish what Marc's saying was true. 😆 But I don't see how it could have been. Still - far be it from me complaining, with all we witnessed in the past few years! 🤩 What a time to be alive. 🤯<br>

Seems to me you suffer from the case of bad morals. Sorry to be the one to say. Stupidity in the thinking on display is not the type of low IQ or lack of rational thinking. No—it's the type of "what I think (or vaguely feel) is good, is actually bad". Bad morals.<br>
Many have remarked by now on the spectacle of people getting personally offended(??) for other people getting fun and joy out of drawn pictures?! (excellent on the topic https://daveshap.substack.com/p/you-think-that-ai-is-destroying-art)<br>
I don't even understand how you imagine what you think good would work. You draw something I don't like, I call the police on you, we throw you in jail? So then you, I presume, self-police? We got taste-police? Only people in good taste get to create or talk or sing or draw. The rest go on mandatory education and then there is certification of ability? IDK how to imagine that world.<br>
I changed my own view on IP. Now I think all IP laws should be deleted. There are other ways to compensate creators, can be implemented should society choose to. Prior/more on that here- https://x.com/ljupc0/status/1904491968068977148.<br>

Very few parents today are unfortunate enough to burry their own children. That in my book counts for a lot.<br>
The human population size didn't change much for a very long time, 1000s of years. The steady state was: family has 5-6 kids, 2-3 die before having kids of their own, about 2 continue on, recreate the same pattern => population stable.<br>
There is a saying: people have many fears until they become parents. Then afterwards almost all of them mostly have just one fear. And it's the same fear.<br>
Edge of poverty you mention is modern poverty. Mostly relative poverty. Not absolute poverty of old, where famines were common, people dying of hunger once a decade, or continuously of infectious diseases in huge numbers. Even until fairly recently, in living memory, in some parts of the world. All my 4 grandparents were born in the Ottoman Empire. Their families had between 6 and 12 children.<br>
I'd encourage you to check data about the world like https://ourworldindata.org, or read on UN statistics like "Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About The World - And Why Things Are Better Than You Think"  https://amazon.co.uk/gp/product/147363749X.<br>
Even if I'm fully cognisant by now that people hate it totally to have their miserabilism contradicted. Maybe this will preempt some https://ourworldindata.org/much-better-awful-can-be-better.<br>

Curious to read what's your thinking. Didn't hold much definite opinion either way for a long time. But "you may not be interested in X, but X is interested in you" forced me to write down what/how I think/feel.<br>
- Euthanasia. It's hard to deny giving help someone that wants to die to die in a more, rather than less, dignified manner.<br>
  However. No one should be compelled, forced to give help, against their wish to not help someone else die.<br>
  Euthanasia should not be part of any health service. It's a state sanctioned executioner. So it should be service much closer to an executioner function.<br>
  The state is already in the business who lives and who dies. Death is admnistered by the state through the police, and the army. It's legal.<br>
  State executioner via euthanasia should be fine. But conflating that function with the Netional Health Service is dumb and wrong.<br>
  Already with "don't rescisutate" and simlar "pathways" to death being conflated with life care, patient care, health care - leads to trouble and complicaitons that are better avoided. And easily avoided.<br>

Does anyone keep track if any of these forecasts are better, on whatever metrics they care about, than:<br>
1) In the period of next X months from now, that will happen, what already happened in the past X months.<br>
2) Survey dozen contributors, compute average, highlight outliers and reasons for them being so, present with past history of forecast, response, error.<br>
3) Setup @Polymarket forecasting betting competitive process.<br>
Afaik if IMF/Treasury/OBR forecasts were better than the above, those forecasters wd be in a macro hedge fund, making $$$ millions.<br>
Anyone keep track if forecasting like below subtract rather than add value? Maybe OBR/Treasury should just do 1/2/3 of the above forecasting?<br>

If any of IMF/Treasury/OBR forecasts were better than-"I forecast in the next 3/6/12 months the same what happened in the past 3/6/12 moths" the people making them wd be in a macro hedge fund, making $$$ for the fund and millions for themselves. Economic forecasts are worthless in forecasting what will happen in the future with any success in accuracy afaik.<br>
Bloomberg/Reuters do (did?)  surveys within averages and maybe highlighting outliers and reasons for-but don't any method betters a baseline that is "In the period of next X months, that will happen, what already happened in the past X months"?<br>

Return ~3h flight Luton-Skopje or London-Tirana ~£100, taxi transport to/from airports both sides <£100 total, one night Sat-to-Sun AirBnB ~£100. English speaking minder accompany group of 6 to 12 to a good local dentist. Gets all done mid-Sat to mid-Sun, fly back Sun evening. But working with people, esp people in pain in need of medical intervention is difficult. (and not of much people's-person talents myself sadly)<br>

Yes qwq-32b is very good. Love that I got it on a local laptop, with me at all times. Tops my wildest expectations. Got into Machine Learning ~1990, including neural networks then called PDP (Parallel Distributed Processing; in a middle of an AI winter). Did ASR (speech recognition) latter. This' dreams coming true in my lifetime. 🥰<br>

The force of gravity is terrifying and awe inspiring. 😡😫😱 Oh to know that there will be the day when humanity learns to control gravity and bend it our wills... 🤯<br>
Seems to me while humanity has made inroads with electricity, magnetism, nuclear - but little progress on gravity. We are almost as shackled to Earth as Cromagnons were. Progress = devise clever tricks how to lift loads off the earth, (and into space,) ~1K-1M times more efficiently than currently. <br>
Hope after a long hiatus we get another Newton or Einstein sooner rather than later to teach us something new, something we are missing atm.<br>

By voting in people like Trump etc who do actually want to govern.<br>
Then we replace one problem - the deep state, that wants and exercises power, but avoids all responsibility - with another problem: people that want to govern and radically change things, are usually very unhappy people. They typically don't find fulfilment in their daily lives like most of us do.<br>
It's an impossible conundrum, a circle than can't be squared, only approximated. That we also do. We the public try minimise our losses, by trying to elect closer one end, or the other of the spectrum, by judging what's more appropriate in the current circumstance.<br>

I don't blog, as I don't have that much to say on that many that large chunks of real life. I find micro-blogging here - wasn't that the original Twitter? - better for me. This "quantas of ideas" medium suits me. Don't have patience to write (and even read) that much. (Substack seems to be that atm)<br>
But yeah - having a "personal Internet space", the $HOME/public_html/ page of old, is both necessary and convenient! (mine https://ljubomirj.github.io; and it sync-s via git—perfect!)<br>

You are looking for reason and evidence of reasoning where there is none.<br>
People attaching themselves to Person-ism (e.g. Marx-ism) do it to avoid thinking for themselves! Thinking is hard, is taxing, expends lots of energy, it's often unpleasant, and even painful. And confers no big survival advantage to the individual. So we avoid thinking much, and where we have to, we use our guts where we can, ("Type 1") in preference to our brains. ("Type 2") The other major plank of attraction is finding a group of people to associate with, then even having become part of your identity, of your self and so on.<br>
I have more sympathy for people that form attachment with Idea-isms. It's much harder to come up with a mutually interlocking and coherent set of ideas, that encompass a wide field of human experience. We all do Idea-ism in our lives, even when we are not noticing it much. These are our "unknown knowns", the 4-th quadrant in the {un/known,un/knowns} quartet. We swim in it, and not notice it, is like what water is to fish swimming in it. Again notice—we don't expand much mental energy to it.<br>

Given you seem interested in this, I encourage you to give 20 mins of your time to "The Landscape of Money" by @Suitpossum on YT https://youtube.com/watch?v=mmWOO7r_NMw&t=6m30s.<br>
It will became clear to you why the pounds created/destroyed by QE/QT can not enter/exit yours and mine pockets, so made not difference to me and yourself spending in the local supermarket. (and did nothing much for the economy, and to inflation)<br>
While the gov uk pounds created during the furlough scheme (coupled with supply side disruptions), had big effect to the economy (for the better—the economy survived the disruption well), and inflation (for the worse—we got inflation).<br>
And if you have ambitions towards macro trading, just learning from the above, this will put you in terms of capability to forecasting the future, above the top 80%-90% of all macro traders out there! :-)<br>
At this level, one has to be more precise with the words "money", "pound" etc. B/c what looks like a "pound" to us as layman in our ordinary daily lives, when one "zooms in" the monetary system, it stops becoming a single entity. Like a chemist "zooming in" water has to take into account molecules and atoms, and a physicists zooming in ever more, needs to start caring about the atoms and electrons etc.<br>

I don't want to disrupt your discussion. Just interjecting briefly, in case this is of interest.<br>
Pounds get destroyed when I pay my tax. (they get created with state spending)<br>
Pounds get destroyed when I pay back a tranche of my bank loan. The principal I return gets destroyed. (it was created upon loan issuance; an asset in the bank loan book, and matching liability for the bank in my current account) The interest portion is earnings for the bank. (may go in the bank profit latter, or offsets bank costs; if profit maybe taken out as dividend, or added to the bank equity)<br>

If you have exquisite taste, then it maybe looks like death to you. To others with 10x times worse sensors resolution, it probably looks like life itself. That's why they do it. And nothing-ness looks like death to them.<br>
This is like wine tasters that have 10x-100x times more the number of taste buds on their palates. Them 0.1% are simply equipped with much finer sensors, sensors with superior resolution, then the rest 0.1% of us. It's a blessing—for one gets to taste tastes and smells that most others miss. But also a curse too—the extra brings the bad with the good in them. They can no longer buy a cheapo $10 wine of a supermarket shelf and enjoy themselves! It tastes like castor oil to them.<br>
One way to experience closer to other's experience, is to make your sensors worse. Much easier done, than the other way around. (to endow someone else with 10x better sensor) So if you have good sight—put glasses that make your sight -1 short-sighted, or +1 long-sighted. Then try drive on a motorway (with that -1), or read off a mobile phone screen (with the +1). Or if you are slim not overweight, put on an actors costume, filled with extra 20kg-30kg weight around waist and upper body, then stay for the day. Repeat for a week. See how it feels.<br>

Correct, but there is a third option too: I notice a client flush with pounds, I will be tempted to ask for more money for my consulting services. Even if my costs have not increased, and there is no increase of demand for my product.<br>
And if all my fellow consultants in the same industry group do the same, then our clients will have to actually pay good way towards our asking price. As things were, my costs—the costs of living—actually did go up ~30% post Covid.<br>

A classic of the genre "IYI thinks books and models take precedence over reality". You may find it emotionally satisfying to delude yourself. But Farage, like Trump before him, is capable of counting, comparing 90 to 10, and drawing conclusions not removed from reality.<br>
As for the good professor. The description how our fiat money system works is afaics correct. The forecasts 1) QE will not cause inflation, 2) in Covid no gov will "go bust", but 3) we may get inflation, were 3 out of 3 correct. (and any macro traders worth their salt are grateful.) However—if one spends years lecturing the world "a deficit number is arbitrary, the limit is inflation", then one has to stick to their intellectual guns, once inflation does appear. (whatever the reason maybe.)<br>
Political correctness, pandering to the own tribe, while short term opportune, are longer term losing propositions. As academia is finding out now. (not something I wish on them)<br>

Did you miss @StephanieKelton's " *INFLATION* is the real limit!" ?? The very same paragraph. Did you miss or forget UK's inflation problems in the past years?? Is this the case of wishful thinking, or genuine failure in reading comprehension?<br>
Here is something for you to chew on. Given choice between options:<br>
#1) inflation - 100% of people, all of us, lose 10% of our wealth each; or<br>
#2) unemployment - 10% of people, made unemployed, lose 100% wealth; (but the 90% are just fine)<br>
In a democracy, option #2 (unemployment for few) always wins at the ballot box over option #1 (inflation for all).<br>
For unemployment and ruin for 10%, pay for life going just fine for 90% that remain employed, and without a care in the world. (given there is no inflation.) And 90% for "business as usual" is more than 10% of "life sucks" when it comes to casting our votes.<br>
Whereas option#1 (inflation for all) makes life worse for 100% of the population. Who then vote out the incumbent. And vote in the guy who promises "I will fix the inflation problem."<br>
There - mystery solved for you. A politician should have counting as core skill.<br>

Maybe there is something with the way people balance absolute versus relative gains? We all have value systems that are combinations of two types of metrics: absolute and relative. It occurs to me, if I weight absolute measures little, and relative much, then I end up caring much about redistribution, and little about creation. Maybe combined with the games playing aspect of it—redistribution seems to me being more social than creation. Creation strikes me more of a solitary pursuit.

Reads like the academic establishment sucked all life out of it. Leaving a limp lifeless husk.<br>
To give some credit to academia, for decades figures like Hinton, Sutton still got funding, were not completely run out of town, even if marginalised.<br>
On the other hand, much interesting breakthroughs of "just do more, moar power!!" type pushing from a boundary out into the unknown, happened in industrial R&D. Funded by companies, and largely isolated from the malign influences of academic group think, and "you scratch my back I scratch yours" monkey business that is allocating state research funding.<br>
Academia did excellent in education of young researchers though! Can attest that having done UK higher education myself. And having two kids in the 20 years since. UK educaiton punches much much above its weight. All things considered how much UK state spends on it.<br>

Yeah agreed there—it's misallocation of resource. Or phrased differently—we hope better allocation of the same resources (human potential, energy, time, labour, materials, capital etc) is achievable. How exactly—IDK tbh.<br>
Contemporary option that comes to mind—everyone of us becomes smarter version of ourselves, more adapted, making better decisions, by being helped by AI in making decisions. AI expanding our intellectual abilities, building on the top of the extra data and information that's made available to us too by the IT and telecommunications revolutions.<br>
While being cognisant it's a tall order, as many have tried before to better us humans (e.g. the "new socialist man" I remember from my childhood), and often failed. Not all are fails though. There is rationalism and humanism that bettered us all since 1800-s. So I'm more white, than black pilled tbh.<br>

There is no rational argument to be made to others "I want you need you to live poorer harder life today because ...(something something in the future that might happen or not)". There is none. I try find random psycho-social justifications for those people. B/c without even that, I'd hate those people even more than now.<br>
I imagine: they are lazy, assume everyone else is, so "let's not build". Or they are millennial children to boomer parents, double dose of "me-myself-and-I" view to everything.

IK, thanks. If you look in LMStudio, you will see there are 2 major packages external to LMStudio: MLX, and llama.cpp. And one can see which version of which one does LMStudio use.<br>
The llama.cpp is a tool and utility separate from LMStudio. Have you used it? Initially, when the 1st LLama model came out, llama.cpp (hence the name!) was the only way to run local models, that were open weights. So me using gguf models harks back at the time when I had llama.cpp, and not LMStudio. (before I even had mbp tbh-just plain old intel pc)<br>

Yeah, only-in my mind economics becomes "BIG problem" only if you have high expectations of econ. :-) <br>
To my mind, (and this goes back to mechanistic model as depicted in this excellent @RayDalio vid https://youtube.com/watch?v=PHe0bXAIuk0), the economy is exchanging milk&eggs for greenbacks. So there are 2 sides/parties { buyer, seller } and 2 things { mlk&eggs, greenbucks } exchanged there.<br>
The greenbucks side of the exchange I think of it as Finance. There in our Fiat system, things are decided by Law. This is primary. Then operationally it is Accounting, and lately nowadays IT implementing it. I see it there being little Economics on the greenbucks side. Economics is very very important, but it's all about the other side, the milk&eggs. That side is in many way much harder to pull off. <br>
So it's to be expected, and I see why and how, things that are true for milk&eggs, are assumed to be true for the greenbucks side. But with finance being a mirror image to the economics side, that minus sign there seems to confuse the hell out of economists!<br>
I have done trading, (which is closer to finance) and there economists are not only useless, but worse than that: reliably wrong! (one can stick a "-" minus sign in front of their forecasts, and do better; in reality we don't do that.) In trading we ignore them. Where we need econ forecast like "next quarter GDP", we just take "last past quarter GDP" as forecast. That does better than 99% of econs, but with zero effort.<br>

Thanks. I used to use them as this was the 1st thing I knew about. (the time when llama.cpp was the only way to run local?) Latter I found LMstudio can share them with llama.cpp. (on the command line.) But maybe MLX is built into the llama.cpp nowadays? So no need for gguf, mlx alone suffices - anyone know?<br>

Would like to, if possible at all/and or not too hard, to be able to "see show me ALL replies, (either breadth first, or depth first-does not matter) to a post". So no matter how deep the replies are-would like to be able to see them all. All replies, to an initial post.<br>
Most of the time I don't care about the level tbh. Initial post is one thing, then all replies are about the same to me. When replying to many people, N>2 levels deep, it's it's just impossible to find a reply. Even when I know it exists, b/c I wrote it myself!<br>

IK if I am diligent enough, to spy the small icon reading "2" (or more) on a post, and click to expand the replies, and go through a lot of posts, then eventually will nab the one I'm looking. But once it's more than a few, and more than a few levels deep-it's just too much trouble to bother with tbh.<br>
Nowadays we got TB of disk space, GB of RAM, GHz of CPU, Gbps of network bandwidth, Kpixels of screen. I'm sure our computers can handle more than 20-50 posts. If people complain, just brush them off with "buy a better computer, you cheapskate - it's totally worth it!" <br>

Sure - all other things considered. Where "all other things" involves: the other country may invade you, and or kill you. Countries war with each other all the time, no? US does it, but it's hardly the exception. IDK what you think you know, that the rest of the world doesn't.<br>
Also - note many countries are not invaded. Plus - the example you give (Libya) is one of the examples where the country was not invaded. There was no invasion by US there. (there was other involvement; and European countries e.g. UK and France more than US)<br>

...money doesn't buy 100% of happiness, but it's about 50% of it.<br>
In the following sense. If I have no money and struggle to keep food on the table and roof over my head  daily, it's much harder to be happy. Chances are I will be unhappy struggling to keep myself alive. <br>
Whereas if I can keep my bottom level Maslow hierarchy of my needs sorted, then I can devote myself to living an examined life. And maybe I will be happy, maybe unhappy, 50% chance there. But struggling to make ends meet, almost guarantees unhappiness, 90% of the time.<br>
Ofc as all things human-plenty of exceptions to all rules and stereotypes. Exceptions and outliers don't undo the averages and the expectations though.<br>

@ Fred Johnson At this level, one has to be more precise with the words "money", "dollar" etc. B/c what looks like a "dollar" to us as layman in our ordinary daily lives, when one "zooms in" the monetary system, it stops becoming a single entity. Like a chemist "zooming in" water has to take into account molecules and atoms, and a physicists zooming in ever more, needs to start caring about the atoms and electrons etc.<br>
For my money the best presentation & abstraction I know of is "The Landscape of Money" by @Suitpossum, on YT https://youtube.com/watch?v=mmWOO7r_NMw&t=6m30s. There maybe others, but this one I understand, and afaics there are no gross inaccuracies in the mechanics of things. (oft people are simply wrong in the mechanics of what moves where when why)<br>
For my taste, abstracting spreadsheets—instead of rings—works as well. It tallies ok with reality. Fed owned spreadsheet=>only Fed changes numbers up/down there. Fed manages cells names "Reserve", "T-Bill" "Note" "Bond" etc. Likewise, City bank spreadsheet=>only City changes numbers up/down, accounts names are "Checking", "Saving". The numbers are "City dollars". They stop existing (with the spreadsheet) when City goes bankrupt, is killed off by The Fed. (and deleted from the system.) The "token rings" with tokens (various dollars) moving on the wires from cell to cell, is visually ood abstraction imo.<br>

So in the end there are consequences, to whatever we chose to do. And we navigate those to the best of our abilities. The theoretical advice given by the good professor, is a theory, that does not survive contact with reality. As far as I can see.<br>

My understanding is he already knew that in Syene, on that one day of the year, at noon, the shadow was length exactly zero.<br>
("Syene (modern Aswan), it was recorded that at noon on the summer solstice, the Sun was directly overhead, meaning objects cast no shadow.")<br>
So he only had to measure the length of the shadow on that very same day of the year, at noon exactly, in Alexandria.<br>
("Eratosthenes realized that if they measured the shadow of a pole in Alexandria at the exact same time (solar noon), any difference in shadow length would indicate that the Earth’s surface was curved.")<br>

Yep—a police, a Sherlock Holmes-type "investigation" collecting evidence judged  possibly relevant, and subsequent "trial" to tally up the pro-s and the contra-s of the evidence, and come to a binary yes/no conclusion, is imo the right way to think about this.<br>
The http://rootclaim.com methodology implements some of this afaics. Write down all evidence collected. Quantify the evidence with a view towards the outcome. The "probability theory as the logic of science" view makes every sense to me. See E.T.Jaynes "Probability Theory: The logic of Science" book, and there are other texts too.<br>

😄 Heh - if only that were true, the world would be a simpler place to navigate.<br>
Yes, we are free to name something else (person, country, river) etc however we very well please. With entities that "have agency" of some sort (person, country - yes; river - no), then they are free to take pleasure, or offence, or anything in between, as they please too. (to our naming them.) So there is that for us to consider too. 😅 And we usually do consider! 😊<br>

If that was true, there would 2 groups of countries in the world - with-ID, and without-ID, and the with-ID group would have 90% of the problems only, of the without-ID countries. Whichever way the terms like "100%", and "problems" are measured. (Where by "ID" I mean "single national obliged mandated by the state ID". B/c we all use multiple ID-s in our daily lives in the UK, only they are not single, not mandated by the state and so on.)<br>
There is simply zero evidence for that, I'm afraid.<br>
In reality, they solve some problems, possibly problems you encounter in your daily life. While creating new problems, where there are none now, for some other people. To a net gain of "problems solved" of zero imo.<br>
I lived in a with-ID country for the first 30 years of my life, before emigrating to, and settling in, the UK. When everything is tallied up, I think the UK without-ID system works well enough. And certainly better than in other places, both without-ID and with-ID.<br>
I know many people would like "with-ID better" to be true. And I wish it was, for there would be a simple and known fix to "reduce 10% of our problems". I'm afraid it is not, to the best of my knowledge. Previously I've opined on this here<br>

Well—afaics Trump US is "Canada join US", and Canada is "No!" So there's that. Ofc the future is unknown. Things may happen then, that seems inconceivable now. Starting an economic war with Canada may have seemed unlikely a year ago. War does not seem to me that inconceivable. US invades countries and starts wars not infrequently.<br>

I used to joke "what would Merkel have done differently if she were to be an FSB sleeper agent".<br>
Now I look at Trump foreign policy and think "what would Trump do differently if he were an FSB sleeper agent". Starting a war with a neighbour (Canada), a war with one of your own allays (Denmark) to shatter the alliance existing both sides of the Atlantic, sounds like a pretty solid plan of action to further Russia interests tbh.<br>

It blows my mind that most of H2O mollecules that ever existed on Earth have been recycled about forever. That 60% of my body that is H2O after I die will be recycled in the ground, in the rivers, the clouds, then used to make some other body  of a worn, or a bird, or a dog, or indeed another human. Like LEGO blocks. And the process is occuring daily, about 1 litter per day too.<br>
IK the same is true of every atom. As with scarcity of natural atomic reactions and natural decay, it can't be otherwise. Still H2O being molecule (even a simple one) not mere atoms feels more interesting. Maybe b/c we drink it, can taste it, can feel it. Unlike elementary atoms.<br>

Do you have any tips for students or other budding researchers about research in general? How to choose what to work on, how to how to make good progress?<br>
28:06<br>
Yes, I think I do. Get a research notebook and write in it every day. Write what, write your thoughts, and and and work on your thoughts. Try to challenge them and make them better. If you want other people to be interested in what you think, then you should start by caring about it yourself, and you should care about at least enough to write it down and challenge it and develop it to progress it. That's the most important thing. I hit on that strategy, and it really changed my whole trajectory.<br>
28:41<br>
It's really hard to do because it's a blank page, and you know, what do you have to say? And maybe you're not, maybe you're confused about what you're what you're thinking. One saying I thought to help with that is that usually the value of writing down your thoughts is directly proportional to how vague and confused they are. The value is proportional to how hard it is to write them right. If you say, "I don't even know how to—I'm thinking six things at once. I can't possibly write this down," that's when it will be super valuable. When you do write something down, is that a way that you know that you have an idea that you really want to pursue? Is that a sign?<br>
29:21<br>
No, it's it's that would be scary. It's got to be just like you and the page, and you're trying to be clear to yourself about what you're thinking. If you can't think of anything else to write, just write down what you think are the six interesting ideas that you've got rolling around in your head. So, just then write them down, one through six. Then say, "Well, is that really all of them? Is there a seventh one?" Well, are these six ideas really two of them the same, or just take another paragraph on each one of those six things and explain what you meant by it. Explain to yourself what your thought is.<br>
29:59<br>
And just by doing that, you will say, "Oh, now that thought kind of just disappeared into nothingness when I tried to explain it." You know, maybe it isn't anything. You know, or maybe it grew and changed as you wrote it down. All those things will happen. And so it's important just to keep, keep, keep writing. Try to do a page a day. Don't, don't stress out too much, but do keep doing it on a regular basis. That's my advice.<br>

I am amazed Europe is still relying on US BigTech. USA of the MAGA and TBPR (Tech Bro Progressive Right) laser focused on perceived China threat. Joining forces with Russia at light speed, will be casting Europe as their common enemy within months it looks to me. GNU/Linux, open source open weights open thoughts open agents, open everything is the obvious solution in the lands of the Internets. Too bad for Europeans they are not tech-conscious, and their elites are phobic word-cells not doers. This may change the first time Google shuts down portions of their Gmail on Trump orders.<br>

Afaik there is no "China" as in "The China" as this single one entity, that decided to do this or the other. This strikes me as the wrong abstraction to use. What there is—is hundreds of millions of people doing their thing: stuff they like, find profitable, or simply possible, within the constraints of the system they live in.<br>
I doubt very much anyone too high up the CCP knew of DeepSeek before R1. And if they knew, whether they would be approving of. Or more likely—hostile to a quant trading firm speculating on the financial markets.<br>
Listening to the founder Liang Wenfeng‘s interview https://youtu.be/LknX8qXsgfA?si=aHchfzCjpvkacf8v, he strikes me as an idealistic person that finally got the means to do stuff he really wanted to. Being in the same industry (quant trading), even if not in China, I have witnessed idealism like this more than once. Am always amused how distant-as-to-be-impossible explanation, it seems to be, to outsiders.<br>
"Open source, open weights, open thoughts"—the latest now today, probably tomorrow "open agents"—is the winning combination when striving for personal agency, personal liberty, for taking control, in the information age we live in.<br>
What else is there? My personal life controlled by a MegaCorp, or a MegaState, for whom I'm less than an ant? They could squash me and not notice. That's how big the power disparity is. So the appeal to "open everything" to redress in parts that imbalance, seems reasonable and understandable to me.<br>
I'm always surprised by how obscure the foundational ideas of the Internet remain—especially to people who've grown up entirely within it. Just yesterday met an eager earnest student (opining on "ai safety") that was born and has grown in the lands of the Internets. And yet—he'd never heard of GNU or @fsf or the ideas of Richard Stalman! This seems like living in a market economy, yet being unaware of markets. Maybe that's a shape a victory takes—becoming ideology, "unknown knowns", water to the fish swimming in it.<br>
I've yet to meet a normie who realizes the Personal Computer revolution, the Internet revolution, and now the AI revolution were all kicked off by mildly autistic, mostly altruistic nerds—for almost no expected compensation, just the joy and glory of creation.<br>

Mine have evolved into thematic long threads. At some point I start a new one, and copy & paste some context from the old thread. Got about 6-10 going now for some time. Guess about tallies with personal global interests?<br>
I guess in the extreme it would be a branching tree. "I" at root, branches getting longer... "thicker" might be better abstraction? Then, at some point a branch branches. Either in two branches of about equal width. Or small branch sprouts sideways starting very thin compared to the main one. (that's much thicker.)<br>
They keep growing as new stuff is added at the ends. I rarely have doubts which one to extend with a new query. I guess that would be one sign of "too much branching": if one is unsure, is not immediately obvious, which branch to extend.<br>

Half is a-plenty! :-) Better than all the alternatives tried.<br>
Truth is—research is super expensive. People never hear about all the technologies that never panned out even after decades of investment. What "did not pan out" means—people working on for many years, payed wages, and then nothing to show for it.<br>
Another way of saying: it's an uncertain business. May pan out, or may not. Every time applying for research grants, it felt fake, it felt a lie, having to answer "write down what you will discover in the 3 years". Well—if I already knew, it means it was discovered already. Not current Research then!<br>
(afaik - people got around by saying "I will discover in 3 years", portions of what they already discovered in the past 3 years; plus a bit of vague hopium on top)<br>

It still amazes me their thinking about other things though. (not strictly tech) For example, reading something on FB. "Mum, when you see it, it simply means someone, someone exactly like yourself, wrote what they think about something, and want to tell the world. That's it. Doesn't mean anything else. Doesn't mean it's true, doesn't mean it's false. It's exactly as if yourself wrote on FB what you think of that same thing."<br>

Or when a boomer mum reads a FB post, and mutters "why is my Friend writing this to me?" (narrator: she is not writing to you, but to the world in general; you are part of that world-that's why the message gets to you-but not the the only part)<br>
Maybe simply people not examining their lives, stuck in a "me, myself and I" baby-like stage? Not separated the "I" from "not-I" (=the world at large) that we all start as/with at birth? (could say-our death is the ultimate separation there)<br>

It gets better honest. M2 mbp for the 96gb ram and gpu/npu recently. After lifetime of ThinkPads + Xubuntu. Yes pain to start with-but. Between iTerm2, $ brew install, back to bash (from default), git, and ask Gemini incessantly for shortcuts etc the most basic of stuff (*not* trying to figure out for myself - ask 1st) - it got better rapidly. Now I loathe to look at my old ThinkPads screens.<br>

I remember when SORN (Statutory Off Road Notification) was introduced in law (or came into force), someone mentioned:<br>
"This is a rare piece of legislation, where one can break this law, by doing nothing. By just sitting at home doing nothing, one breaks the law."<br>
It struck me as a good principle - a good law should not be broken by inactivity, by doing nothing imo. Yes exceptions exists, yes rules of thumb can be broken.<br>
But imo - can be broken with a good reason only. And the law that brought SORN looks to me as breaking a good principle, but without a good reason.<br>

Step 1. Detach from the real world, become completely un-bound from reality. Step 2. Construct alternative reality as per your primal wishes. Step 3. ???<br>
I can't figure the Why in the step 3. One would have to speculate the psychology, the state of mind of people doing it. Rational analysis does not suffice.<br>
Drama, maybe comedy can shed light? The "guitar for sale" joke by @rickygervais 😂 Or like when on X, random people being shown some post of his, think *he* wrote to them *personally*, and get angry. ("why are you telling me this??") Like when a boomer mum reads a FB post, and mutters "why is my Friend writing this to me?" (narrator: she is not writing to you, but to the word in general; you are part of that world, but not the the only part)<br>
Parliament is younger though. Maybe millennial children to boomer parents?? 😶 IDK. One can only resort so stereotypes at this point. The "me, myself and I" generations, where a baby has not quite grown up, not separated the "I" from "not-I" (=the world at large) that it starts as at birth.<br>

You can read say stats about the real world on OWID if you want to know. They collect and collate data collected from reputable UN and national statistics agencies in a easily digestible comparison graphs.<br>
Doomer thinking is not only unproductive, but leads towards a stalin levels of insanity. If one starts with "8B will die in near future, with absolute 100% certainty". Then any solution, no matter the cost, becomes not only morally just, but a moral imperative. (.e.g one needs to delete 4B of us people Thanos-style, to save the other 4B)<br>
The error of this thinking is "100% certainty the world will end sometime in the future." Anyone claiming to know about the future with absolute 100% certainty is lying to you. (maybe to themselves too) Future is impossible to know with 100% certainty. (one very definition of future is "that what can't be known with 100% certainty.")<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
It's implied in your mind. But not in everyone else's.<br>
That same "will deny the premise is true, for I hate the consequences" (that I infer, imagine) is what also drives the denial with the goldbugs, and cryptos people. One would expect with them being directly interested in the mechanics of the monetary system (and in general - the finance side), to at least know the mechanics of the current fiat system.<br>
They imagine the consequences to be - Gosplan! They recoil in horror, and proceed to deny the premises. Now I'm not saying there are zero people who are indeed attracted to the premise, b/c they are attracted to the Gosplan consequence. The world is a big place. All sorts of people. Some will be wanting Central Planning of the economy.<br>
My point is - that doesn't necessarily follow from the premises. Yes one of the things possible - but other things are possible too. Got reminded again with the fun spectacle 😁 recently of Musk discovery of "dozen computers that just credit dollars into recepients accounts out of thin air!" bombshell. 😂<br>
(2ndary point: with all the consolidation cartelization monopoly power in all industries we have witnessed in our lifetimes - are we sure the system isn't already half descended into a Gosplan?)<br>

Well there is always tension, that's why 1 vote in 4 years, MP is not a simple pass through conduit of the wishes of the constituents, but has to synthesise the best for 1) them, 2) him, and 3) the country. That's why e.g. US a Republic - b/c the demos can be plenty bad, do plenty wrong too.<br>
We have the California example where putting everything to popular vote gave them rule so dysfunctional, that people are fleeing the richest state in the US. There is also the case of Switzerland where devolved power works better it seems.<br>
Imo it's not so much up or down, left or right - but smart v.s. stupid. The decision making judged by the results. Quangos were seemingly made for a world where not much change happens, no fast reactions needed. Now we are in a fast changing world. The old system does not suffice, it's falling short.<br>
My favourite hobby horse is Radical Transparency. Imo much more about the inner workings of government bureaucracy needs to be open, avilable online for all to read. ("with enough eyes, all bugs are shallow.") These are gargantuan systems of people, rules, procedures etc. The sooner it's seen what's obv wrong in the process, the sooner a chance to remedy.<br>

The idea that there is some "objective" criteria leading to "objective" decision which is "the best" was always convenient fiction to hide narrow interests behind the "objective". Oldest trick in the book. "I'm not ideological. It just so happens what benefits me is objective, even natural order of things."<br>
The experts are there to give advice, not to decide. Given power to decide—well the experts pursue their own interests. Who wold have known? They are only people. Coupled with surprisingly badly though out legislation leading to "team bat, team newt" but no "team human"?? (let's see if things improve when AI Lawyer v3 comes online 🙃 )<br>
All in all—ends with quangos becoming a case of "good servant, bad master". It was too convenient for a while to pretend. Yeah time to "take back control", haha. We have all become brexiteers now. 😂<br>

Good piece. You identified the problem. Politicians have responsibility without power. Quangos have power without responsibility. Responsibility is the feedback part of exercising  power given to you by the demos. By separating the two, the feedback mechanism was broken. That's why it seems the country is on autopilot, not responding to the wishes of the electorate. Because the mechanism to do so has been broken.<br>
You must abolish OBR, abolish Sentencing Council, and then bunch of others, if you want to do stuff as per your election promises. TBS if this LAB government has that in them. IDK what's the issue with KS just abolishing them with a stroke of a pen in a single day. Will LAB MPs bring down the gov and force elections? Unlikely I think. MPs are cognisant half of them will not be re-elected if new elections were held tomorrow.<br>

Sorry, maybe I misunderstand: there is no counter-argument. As I had not watched the video yet when commenting. As mentioned - could not watch it but still decided to comment as the open source nature of R1 is a bit of a hobby horse of mine, couldn't help myself. (was in a pub after a walk on a sunny day, couldn't play the video;  English countryside pic below to brighten your day maybe).<br>
After watching now - yes the video does not make a big deal out of the "open source, open weights, open thoughts" of R1. That imo was the big deal, on par with the performance. For if the release was just another closed model to chat or API with, like ChatGPT or Claude or Gemini, maybe would have been a sensation (given o1 was the only thinking model then), but not a game changer. I think the open aspect of it was a total game changer, as it spawned a new ecosystem.<br>
Also I heard no mention of the "week of open source releases" (done recently) when DeepSeek open sourced 6 crucial components of their tech stack. Imo they have all been well received. But 1 of the 6, the RL algorithm used, has been taken on used by others, inspired them, who used it and improved it. And thus spawned a mini revolution in thinking models. Before R1 release, IDK how many people even thought RL was possible or practical. Basically how o1 was trained was a mystery.<br>

Dislike commenting before watching, but: if DeepSeek didn't release "open source, open weights, open thoughts" it would have been a nothingburger. It's the open angle that's spawned an ecosystem building up now.<br>
FB Lamma was the initial chink in the armour, opening in the "close everything" doom descending on us with the AI age. But DeepSeek V3 and R1 especially was the game changer that opened the floodgates.<br>
Releasing their prop secrets and especially RL recepies truly cemented the change. Irreversible now, despite what Darios of the world say or want having crossed over to the dark side.<br>
A single ray of light suffices to illuminate vast darkness. A single amber starts a new flame. 🔥 Could not be prouder of a fellow quant, 😍 the other side of the world. 🌎 Kudos to them.<br>

If Radical Transparency facilitied a somewhat different system, while still delivering on people's desires wishes hopes for themselves and their children - I see nothing wrong there.<br>
I suspect Radical Transparency for State, Government etc buroucracy is the direction of travel. It takes feedback to keep a gargantuan system on the straight and narrow. So it's both needed, and made possible by the IT and communications technologies.<br>

Naah. Biology is not like physics where a single equation written on one page of paper suffices. Even there - half the heavy  lifting is provided by mathematics.<br>
Biology is a weak general rule + million of edge cases. Before computers, there was simply no way to record that million. Now with  computers biologists can. With AI that's moved to encoding then transforming that knowledge into something useful we care to achieve.<br>

Well then I invite you to continue thinking critically, and take the next logical step on your journey: why?? Why is the UK pricing system the way it is?<br>
Having said that. I'd encourage you to check discussions on the issue of UK energy, pricing etc on Reddit. Conference forum is better more productive media format for discussion.<br>

Yes! :-) Agreed. (didn't wan't to elaborate)<br>
Related pet hypothesis: there is not much going in the gut, or the heart etc. It's all in the brain. There is cross-talk in the neurons (the way for there is for the word "hot", and hot food, if I recall correctly): we feel butterflies in the stomach, because some processing related to signals coming from the stomach, happens in neurons close by in the brain, to the neurons processing say risk or uncertainty or danger etc. Or love feelings being processed by neurons close by to ones processing signals communicating with the heart.<br>

Procrastination. Employ someone to do the tasks for you if you possibly can, TaskRabbit style. For tasks involving a computer typing on keyboard - I try use AI agents nowdays. If programming, even when not strictly faster, I find it to be less boring with company. AI programming agents are cheap or even free, find them totally worth it.<br>
Not being solo all alone with the boring task - it should become easier to do. Same for not computer stuff - seek company. Boring task becomes less boring when done in company of someone else, not doing it alone. Even when that someone else is AI agent.<br>
Having said that. If I found myself being bored to death by everything I am to do today—I would be re-examing my life choices. What do I want to work on, how do I want to live my life. But once in a while—I find it fine. Not everything is super exciting every single day.<br>

Procrastination is not a time management problem. It’s an emotion management problem.<br>
You’re not avoiding work. You’re avoiding tasks that feel boring, frustrating, or stressful.<br>
Postponing prolongs pain. The dread of starting is quickly outweighed by the joy of progressing.<br>

There is a good observation by @michaelmalice (who I'm binge listening to for few days now, having YT algo serendipity do it's job well) that black pilled people hate and will pounce on a single while pilled person. B/c a single while pilled out there is a danger, it ruins their world view.<br>
When the world view is "*everything* is bad, everything is shit", then a single person piping up "akshually this one thing improved" repudiates the *everything*. That one crack letting single ray of light into the darkness, destroys the whole worldview system. So this one voice can't be allowed to exist.<br>

But where does the single file live? I'm in the single file camp. Git sync-ing via push merge etc works good, no fear of losing changes. Fwiw not a comfortable experience on a mobile. (non iPhone)<br>
Standard but at home ~/logBook ascii text file as in any project. Entry  starts as ^-(space), ends in empty line, searchable in vim. New entries added at top, pushing oldies down. Sections  FIXME TODO DONE DONTDO. Entries move from TODO into DONE wholesale without further  editing. Entries in TODO  for long enough are moved into DONTDO without ceremony. (can always move them back) No adding to TODO while FIXME is non-empty without a good reason.<br>

I wish I knew of a way to immunise the society and public discussion from the malign influence of doomers. It's too easy for doomers to take over! We see it in the public policy in energy, and also AI. The AI case is not the exception but the rule, replayed with every new tech. (c.f. @PessimistsArc)<br>
We are wired that way, to pay great attention to the possible risks. Subsequently, false alarms where the dangers didn't pan out, are forgotten and memory holed straight to /dev/null.<br>
The alternative history where the society would have been, the opportunity loss, is usually not given much thought. In the long run, this opportunity cost of opportunities lost, matters a lot!<br>
When one start from a thesis that 8B will die at some point in the future, with absolute 100% certainty, say by 2125. Then if a solution exists, but needs to delete 4B of us people Thanos-style, to save the other 4B, that policy becomes not only morally just, but even a moral imperative!<br>
This is stalin-level-insanity line of thinking doomers  engage in. It's how deaths cults work. No one starts with "I'm Thanos-evil, follow and obey". No - it's always for saving of humanity. Lesser evil, means justifying ends, etc - to save something that will be lost in the far future.<br>
The error of this thinking is "100% certainty the world will end sometime in the future." Anyone claiming to know anything about the future with absolute 100% certainty is lying to you. (maybe to themselves too) Future is impossible to know with 100% certainty. (one very definition of future is "that what can't be known with 100% certainty.")<br>

Third option: they have other priorities. They prioritise something else more. In the US case: the economy. The economy for the vast number of Americans didn't deliver as per their desires. So they voted for change.<br>
The institutions, democracy, how people are governed - that's means to and end. Not the end itself. "How" matters less to people than their personal well being. (or even "life, liberty, pursuit of happiness").<br>
If an authoritarian dude says "it's bad, I will fix it" he will win over the institutionalist that messages "it's mostly fine, and that other guy is going to be Caesar". And if the newly elected Caesar manages to turn things around fr, (unlikely - but not impossible,) then he will be crowned king for life by the plebs.<br>

When you start from a thesis that 8B will die at some point in the future, with absolute 100% certainty. (say 2125 is end of the world for you maybe? IDK what it's your forecast.) Then if a solution exists, but needs to delete 4B of us Thanos-style, to save the other 4B, then it becomes not only morally just, but even a moral imperative, to do so.<br>
This is stalin-level-insanity line of thinking you are engaging in. It's how every death cult ever in history worked. No one starts with: I'm Thanos-evil, follow and obey. No-it's always for saving of humanity. Lesser evil means justify ends to save something that will be lost in the far future.<br>
The error of your thinking is "100% certainty the world will end sometime in the future." Anyone claiming to know anything about the future with absolute 100% certainty is lying to you. (and maybe themselves too) One very definition of future is "that what can't be known with 100% certainty."<br>
Although with yourself and those around you, revealed preferences tilt more towards "difficult to get a man to understand something, when his salary depends on his not understanding it." For if you really believed in your "end of times" catastrophizing, you'd be building shelters down salt mines, or rockets to other planets.<br>
For whatever measures you propose, will do zilch, nothing, for the thing you fear. Possible explanations to reconcile ideas and actions may involve psychotic do nothing bed wetter, a grifting grifter suckling at that sweat, sweat government tit, caring not for driving millions into poverty in the process.<br>
No change will happen with the current CO2 trajectory.  Even if UK sank today in the ocean and you achieved your net zero goal by dinnertime. We had 1C warming in the past 80 yrs. The world has never been in better shape looking at OWID consolidated graphs. All things considered, and compared to the recent past. In a century by 2125, Manchester England may end with the average temperature that Milan Italy has today.<br>

Team human - when?<br>
It's been more than a decade. Closing coal was a great success. Pocket that win, and move on. Given the state of the world, UK could sink in the ocean achieve Net 0 overnight, and it will make 0 difference to anything climate related.<br>
The energy policy is causing immiseration to millions now. My local CoOp in one of the well off towns in SE England is now locking toothpaste and gaviscone on the shelves in plastic boxes. If you don't scrap your the ill thought energy policy soon, in 3 years the newly elected PM Farage will get rid of it for sure anyway.<br>
Rarely can one see slow motion self own shooting oneself in the foot in real time. The energy policy is the textbook definition of stupid "one causing loss and suffering to others, for no gain to themselves or even a small loss".<br>
Tbf I think you will not change in time. Have yet to see a politician that's not an egomaniac or psychologicaly damaged in some way. Bothering to write this only b/c can't get to sleep. And b/c it's painfully obvious to all outsiders that policy change is a must.<br>

You are free to pursue your personal jollies at you own expense. *Not* abusing the public purse. R&D is very very expensive. The cost of getting it wrong is massive. That cost is payed by *immiseration* of millions. TBH I'm amazed how patient Great British public is with you dunderheads. In many countries your arse will be hanging off a stick by now.<br>
In UK we are finding the cost of R&D by trial&error by incompetent elites out at our expense. Elites have the duty of care and doing their homework to the utmost of their abilities. Not chasing their personal hobby horses like unicorns after rainbow.<br>

Exactly - you don't know. No one can know, just by a number like "41%". For numbers like "one in six", "41% of the species" to acquire meaning, you are to compare them, to similar numbers, as they were 20-30-50-100 years ago.<br>
I would forward you to sources like aggregates of reputable data coming from UN, national agencies etc collected, collated and nicely presented in Our World in Data, or books like Factfulness: Ten Reasons We're Wrong About The World - And Why Things Are Better Than You Think by the late Rosling—but I won't. I have learned my lessons. Concluded that it's between futile and counterproductive. If someone is driven to find truths about the world around us—they find them themselves. And for those that are not—well that's it, no one can help much.<br>

So that you spend significant portion of your life working, rather than spend your time watching daytime TV and producing nothing of value to society. (or even to yourself) That's the reason.<br>
Federal government don't need your dollars (why would they? you don't create those dollars—they do) any more than a cinema theatre needs the ticket you show and hand it to them, at the entrance to the cinema.<br>

This is awesome you are awesome thanks for releasing open weights! 😍<br>
Do you plan on releasing a tiny version, that we use as crutch in speculative decoding? In LMStudio for Gemma-3 27B I have the 4B version to point LMStudio to for speculative decoding. Or  maybe some other open weights tiny model is compatible with QwQ-32B for speculative decoding? (but LMStudio doesn't know is not telling me when I select QwQ-32Bl; tbf I have not bothered to measure if plugging in the smaller model and turning on speculative decoding helps in the final analysis for {speed,performance} in total; this on MBP M2 LMStudio)<br>
Thanks again for making the world a better place. 🥰<br>

Of the 3 mentioned—on price, mature tech, 100% reliability—only nuclear can be done, is done, and was done. And with France solving the problem half a century ago, and given France-anything is supposed to be to English elite what red rag is to a bull, I hoped people come to their senses.<br>
But no. Jollies like tidal is thrown in there. As if it's ever been done by anyone in the world. R&D is very very expensive. The cost of getting it wrong is massive.

There is a sensible way forward.<br>
Conservative voters and leaners want energy to be produced as cheaply as possible, increased energy security, and the creation of new jobs.  These voters recognise the role that tidal, nuclear and solar can play in achieving these priorities.<br>

...in crypto lingo, I think of the huge effort and fight that goes into each of the "Appropriation Bill"-s as MINING, that's when it's decided who gets what. Then operationally crediting accounts is ADD, taxation operation is DELETE. (taxes are decided in a different law)<br>
There is also a SWAP operation. When some dollars (that you can swap for milk&eggs; but you get 0 extra for holding them) call them "greenbuck", are swapped 1:1 for anther type call them "bluebuck", (swap duration 1yr=Bill, 5yr=Note, 10yr=Bond,) where the greenbuck holder relinquishing it gets >0 extra (the IR interest rate) greenbucks at the end of the swap period, in a PROOF OF STAKE way. (the extra given out is like UBI for people that already have greenbucks, and voluntarily decide forego exchanging them for milk&eggs for pre-set time; they preference getting extra greenabacks instead of milk&eggs.)<br>
That's 30% of dollars added/deleted. The other 70% of the same is outsource to the commercial banks. They are authorised by the state to do ADD. These are loans given. Instead of the Appropriation Bill in Senate/Congress there is looking for credit worthy customers by the credit officer of the bank. The DELETE operation is repaying back of the loan by the private customer. This is also backed by state monopoly of violence. Service the state provides to its agent—the commercial bank.<br>
Given for the 70% (private side) say for every new 100 minted by loans, 150 is returned over the lifetime of the loans, IDK what happens to the 50 extra. Would dearly like to know! (I suspect it's added to the "bank equity" cell in addition to leaking out as dividends, salaries other costs, but IDK for sure; also suspect bank equity is subtracted from when loan is declared not recoverable; that's a 100 DELETE-ed on the private side; should the total equity go under 0, become negative, the bank is bankrupt; is then killed off by it's creator, ultimately The Fed/regulator)<br>
These things are decided by Law. Then operationally it is Accounting, and lately IT implementing. Note there is little Economics in the process. Economics is a about the other side, the milk&eggs. The greenbuck side of the exchange I think of it as Finance. (my impression from trying to learn is—economists are the ones you should listen the least when trying to learn about the Finance side; they're mostly wrong about it; as if with finance being a mirror image to the economics side, that minus sign there confuses the hell out of them.)<br>
For my money the best presentation & abstraction I know of is "The Landscape of Money" by .@Suitpossum (pic below), on YT https://youtube.com/watch?v=mmWOO7r_NMw&t=6m30s. For my taste, abstracting spreadsheets—instead of rings—works as well. It tallies well with reality. Fed owned spreadsheet => only Fed changes numbers up/down there. Fed manages cells names "Reserve", "T-Bill" "Note" "Bond" etc. Likewise, City bank spreadsheet => only City changes numbers up/down, accounts names are "Checking", (in the UK where I'm "Current",) "Saving". The numbers are "City dollars". They stop existing (with the spreadsheet) when City goes bankrupt, is killed off by The Fed, and deleted from the system. The "token rings" with tokens (various dollars) moving on the wires from cell to cell, is visually great abstraction imo.<br>
This is my personal understanding of how things work, pieced together from working in it (for limited time), and reading about it. It's mostly evolved, an ecosystem, where portions are repurposed as the system adapts to the changing environment. (e.g. last big change was becoming not-convertible in gold) There is no central plan or planner. Most people don't know how things work in total. (neither they need to; that's why it lives on—it works, even if most participants don't know how)<br>
State money. For the mechanics of the state money system, you have mmt-ers like .@wbmosler to read. They are correct about the premises of the system. People dismiss the premises, b/c they don't like the conclusion: the central planning GosPlan aspect to it. To my mind, that's doubly wrong. One should not wilfully blind self to the reality. (however unpalatable it maybe.) If you don't like the conclusions like "central planning" (I don't!)—well work on that then. Given the level of monopoly and cartels in the system already (mostly per industry)—maybe it's to a greater extent than we care to admit already centrally planned rn! Admitting to the GosPlan problem is the first step towards changing it, hopefully for the better.<br>
Private (bank) money. Richard Werner has researched and run an observational study (spent time in a bank credit office), and written books and articles https://perplexity.ai/search/princes-of-yen-prof-warner-qiFldXIrS7CsjAIeinMbUg#1 I see there is a web site https://professorwerner.org now. (at some point noticed a "Prof Werner" X acc; I thought an impersonator; then during covid acc went vaxcrazy imo; allow it possible it was the original going "Ignaz Semmelweis"; can see how that happens to a person driven to telling the truth; in an environment hell bent on lying.)<br>

It was always thus.<br>
If you think about it - the tenured professorship in the US, where the professor can not be fired, is setup exactly in the way to allow people to speak up their mind. To not be intimidated easily. Yet not many do.<br>
In trading/tech/business there is a concept of "Fuck You Monney". (FYM) When one is financially secure, so they can't be blackmailed to toe the line, bend the knee. Still-many don't make much with that. Most people don't have any particularly strong thoughts of their own. Just go with the flow.<br>
None are silver bullet. People we are so weak willed. We decide to not publicly speak, what we speak privately, for the most trivial of reasons. Like a tenured professor will decide to keep quiet b/c s/he will not be invited to a dinner party. A captain of industry will care that some random journo will write a bad word on him in a random Substack.<br>
Turns out-no matter how much your Maslow needs are taken care of and secure, there is always something to lose. Or fear sth like disapproval of, of disparagement by, people you would rather like you or rate you. Most of the time, the loss is trivial compared to what's at stake.<br>
It's heart breaking. Oft I think of Solzhenitsyn "We know they are lying, they know they are lying, they know we know they are lying, we know they know we know they are lying--and they still lie!" when the issue of truth and speaking it up comes to mind.<br>

X algofeed serves me 50 posts on one screen full. I check X 10 times per day = 500 posts X to show me daily. That's 500 out of possible 5K to be shown. And 4.5K will not be shown. X algo will decide which 500, out of 5K possible, will show me. Any one acc has probability 0.1 to be seen by me. Or I will see 1 post from 1 acc once in 10 days. Am I missing something?<br>

You get their eggs, they get your green pieces of paper. Poorer or richer - depends, what do you value more? The eggs, or the green paper?<br>
If it's a free exchange, on the free will, a free decision without duress, on both sides, the fact both sides freely chose the transaction, means both sides value both sides of the transaction exactly the same. That's why the transactions happens. At the levels of eggs (number of), and the green scraps of paper (total sum), at which  the exchange happens.<br>
When your household buys eggs from the supermarket, which side benefits more? You, or the supermarket? I think both benefit about equally. Otherwise you would not be buying the eggs, and the super market won't be selling them to you, for the green bucks they exchange them for.<br>
Countries are big places, with millions of people. So when it's said "both countries benefit", does not translate to "every single person in the 100M people that make the country is better off". It's possible some are better off, and some are worse off. It's just that it nets positive in value for the 100M people in the country as a whole. Usually with tariffs, the benefit is small, but accrues to millions of people. While the dis-benefit is large, and accrues to say thousand people.<br>

TBF I don't care about media coverage as I don't consume any other media but social media. Probably a-typical but also possibly not.<br>
I saw recently on YT a political/related interview where the audience (a very politically engaged one!) was asked "raise your hand if you watch BBC 6pm News Live" and not one hand went up!<br>
I need my representatives to communicate 1:1 to myself. Having the PR office disseminate their information 1:N once a day or a week is a model befitting the pre-Social Media age. That model no longer suffices imo.<br>
I'd look at US, and imo I'd be looking into the future. Something that will happen in the UK in 6-18 months. All old media have lost their audiences. New media audiences dwarf old ones in numbers by an order of magnitude.<br>

I like them too. I find it useful that when I read the highlighted words in addition to listening to a lecture, my attention does not drift away, but it's kept on the lecture, on the topic.<br>
(otherwise, when only listening on YT, oft I find myself after 10 mins that I have drifted away thinking about something else not really listening to the lecture.)<br>
Arguably a free user, and I am cognisant that this is taking liberties and looking a gift horse in the mouth. However, if you are looking for feedback on improvements:<br>
1) Make the YT video and the transcript in separate frames or tabs or windows, such that I can still scroll the text down (don't mind that I need to scroll down manually; aids keeping my attention on the lecture tbh), while the video plays at the top of the browser window and I can see the video there. So I have both the video, and the running text highlighter in my view at the same time.<br>
2) Allow for the video to take more of the space at the top of the screen. When watching a lecture like e.g.<br>

UK have heard of evil flex: they have the data, know the right number, don't tell or pre-fill the the box for you, but ask you to fill. Then fine you if you put the wrong number in. Which they detect automatically, knowing what the right number is. Apparently, allegedly - didn't happen to me.<br>

Haha 😆 - the dude is useless clueless even as propagandist! This is elementary school stuff.<br>
Every propagandist knows. Reality is something outside us, but shared by all of us, as default, and without any effort on our part. At almost zero cost zero effort. Our truth is our view on reality. (reality that remains unknown and unknowable to us.) The closer our truth is to reality, it's easier, cheaper, less effort to communicate that truth to all people.<br>
We see this in dictatorial regimes. The regime has to expend inordinate amount of effort to construct fantastical truths very far from reality. The reality everyone experiences for free by default. The regime has to spend a lot to maintain the fiction.<br>
The dude should think why he needs so much money and effort to be able to communicate his truth.<br>

Your party has chance to do better on housing, energy, industry, defence, AI—big issues of the day. Leasehold abolition is the easy win if ever were one for you—given no house builder lavishes their-ahem-"attentions" on your party. Your ideas still look stuck in the local gov potholes fixing.

Reality is something outside us, but shared by all of us, without as default, and without any effort on our part. At zero cost, at zero effort. The closer our side's truth, that is our side's view of that reality, (that shall remain forever unknown and unknowable to us,), the close that truth is to reality, it's easier, cheaper, less effort to communicate that truth to all of us humans.<br>
You see this in dictatorial regimes, where the regime has to expend inordinate amount of effort, to construct a truth completely detached from the reality everyone experiences for free by default. The regime has to spend a lot to maintain the fiction. And as time goes by, it's ever harder to band-aid the cracks appearing.<br>
You should think on, why you need so much money and effort to be able to communicate your truth to everyone.<br>

...are terminally stupid, *not* in the sense of they have low IQ or inability to to think rationally—no, their rational faculties are just fine. But it's that their morality system is deficient, they are immoral. What they think of good, the rest of us think as bad. And vice versa.<br>
So no amount of my explaining that helping Ukrainians fight their war and win, is going penetrate their shell of immorality. For the benefit of any other users that stumble on this thread this is what I have in mind-<br>

Anonymous account accusing others of virtue signalling. 😂 Only on the the Internet.<br>
I take virtue in preference to vice fwiw. Only—I'm not signalling. I am saying explicitly what I think. I'm not giving some mystery signals for others to decode in secret. The current Russia state ideology puts Russia on a trajectory towards "Russian army washing their boots in the English channel" as @KonstantinKisin rightly remarked.<br>
I have seen warring. It don't want to fight a war. And don't want my sons to fight one either. Ukraine war is not my war. Tbf to Ukrainians—none of them are asking us, to fight their war. (should anyone decide to, for ideas and ideals, are ofc welcome, and more power and glory to those brave souls; thanks for providing the link) Ukrainians are asking us, for 3 years now, to assist them with weapons. That's it! For us to produce and give them weapons, the more the better, so they themselves repel their invaders.<br>
Ukraine prevailing in their fight is in my interest. So helping them win is in my interest, in addition to being the right thing. For if Russia is to take over Ukraine, it will absorb the battle hardened Ukraine army. Then position their next dear leader in Belarus, after that human potato Lukashenka finally croaks. Then unite Russia + Ukraine + Belarus in a Greater Russia. Then they will make their next move West. And than the war will become if not mine, then my sons war. Even long before Russians get to "wash their boots in the English channel".<br>
Tbf my "coward" referred to your anonymity. Like putting words out, but without taking responsibility. Shielded by the invisibility cloak of anonymity. (c.f. Slashdot's "anonymous coward") I'm mystified by the level of cowardice, ngl. It's not like you are posting your opinions from Russia, so to be afraid of a flight from a 3-rd floor window or some such??<br>

I have come to think that the current AI, and the future hoped for ASI creation, is teaching us that compute transforming: data → information → knowledge → intelligence → agency → ... is all there is to it. All that ever was to it! Another bitter lesson. We just lacked ambition in scale.<br>
AI path opened now to AGI and latter ASI where previously we didn't see any for many decades. Seems foolish to me to frustrate, slow down, or even forego 2050s Intelligence Revolution that may times-it, by another x10-20x times, the total human wealth as value, the way the Industrial Revolution did in 1800s.<br>
Frustrate for what? So that we provide UBI to Disney shareholders?? That's even self-own by those better-off shareholders, given the opportunity cost! Every one of us is richer, better off, than any king of old. Louis XVI was in many many ways worse off than any one of us. (think dentistry-surgery-anaesthesia)<br>

Things that looked to me "inexplicable stupidity" became less inexplicable and more "ah, stupid—but I understand how and why" once I stumbled upon the follow-on to Cippola's definition of stupid (=="stupid is a person causing loss, pain, suffering to others, for no gain to himself, even at a small personal loss") by Bonhoeffer, that summarised is 1) stupidity is low morals not low IQ, it's thinking something is good, that rest of us find to be bad; and 2) it's social, like a mind virus (hi Elon) occurring in humans groups more than individuals.<br>

OP is making a claim about the *human brain*. You are replying with counter-claims about *universe and everything*.<br>
About the human brain: the neural networks, that are also known as parallel distributed processing (PDP), were explicitly modelled on and inspired by what we know about the human brain workings. Not by accident—but explicitly so. Lookup the "McCulloch-Pitts neuron (1943)". Here is McCulloch<br>

About the claim "Universe is a computer". I wouldn't go that far. I have personally come to think that information is the most fundamental thing in the universe.

That's a very very stupid request. For US will never risk nuclear annihilation for Poland. Putin can nuke Warsaw, and life in NewYork, Washington, San Francisco and Los Angeles will proceed just fine. Did Poland learn nothing from "security guarantees from powerful allies, but which are too far away to help much in time, so not really deterring your enemies" already? (khmkhm1939)<br>
Only way this is not stupid is to get a clear NO from US. That way a possible obstacle on the path to Poland + Nordics + Baltics developing their own nuclear deterrent is removed. For anything else but very own deterrent is not deterrent. Putin is not deterred from attacking Poland by fear of US. As he doubts—as any reasonable person would doubt—that US will risk nuclear war for Poland. (or any other country for that matter.)<br>

I like this aspect of libertarian framing of taxes and public spending: I am taking from someone at the point of the gun. I the government, using my monopoly on violence (ultimately—death), take from someone by force. Something they would rather use to feed their kids. It's not like they give it to me voluntarily, on their own volition. I take it by force. So I have extra special obligation there. What I take, to not be wasted. What I take, to be spent better, than that person would have spent it themselves.<br>
That's quite a high bar. It pains me to read otherwise reasonable people, and or friends, when they say "ah it's only 100M p.a; ah it's just a rounding error."<br>
I think—how much tax did you pay last year? Did you pay 20K say? Ok 20K. Can you imagine how much easier your life would be, if you had those extra 20K available to you? Like—everything stays the same, everything those taxes otherwise buy—in most general sense that's most of the the modern world—nothing changes there. The only change is—you got those 20K extra discretionary spending power at your disposal. Now think conversely—how much grief (if not hardship) lacking those 20K caused you.<br>
Now—everything you though and felt, imagine it's 5000 people, not only yourself. That's the 100M p.a. Chagos. 5000 People like yourself. That's a small town, esp if you scale to be 1-in-household. It's not nothing. Much sweat (if not tears) is spent to gain much less than that.<br>

MAD desired not real outcome—ofc, but I find it "a distinction without difference". This is something about the future, can't be otherwise.<br>

<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=GXgGR8KxFao">https://youtube.com/watch?v=GXgGR8KxFao</a><br>
about the destructive power of modern atomic devices. So that may go towards "assured" in MAD.<br>
But sure there are plenty of references (thanks @grok!) to "survivability, 2nd strike, achieving favourable outcome" and similar, to support the thesis "US/Russia think they can win a nuclear war" too.<br>

One surprising thing social media revealed to me that I didn't know before. How many of us, and how much, we want to tell the world about our inner world. So we write a billion of posts every day here, day after day. It's just flowing, no end in sight.<br>

Yes. I wish we had better theory of information flows in human networks. Would dearly like to know the total amount of knowledge, collectively all together. At various ratios of individual computation versus communication and sharing of information giving rise to knowledge.<br>

Is there data or any measurements on measures of the faculties for communication and or empathy, over the same period?<br>
Human intelligence is collective, not individual. Our head meat-space, needs to be allocated between 1) Individual unit supporting faculties - memory, computation; and 2) Collective group supporting faculties - communication, empathy.<br>
Maybe lately the culture is shifting more towards group faculties, at the expense of the individual ones? Any possible change can only be culture, can't be straight meat-space.<br>
This is not the first time, no? Afaik Neanderthals had bigger cranium than Sapiens. Reasonable to assume that individually in problem solving or reasoning, avg Neanderthal wd better the avg Sapiens? Yet—Neanderthals were out-competed by the Sapiens to extinction.<br>

My personal prejudice is this.<br>
Human intelligence is collective, not individual. Our head meat-space, needs to be allocated between 1) Individual unit supporting faculties - memory, computation; and 2) Collective group supporting faculties - communication, empathy.<br>
To test this hypothesis, one would seek data on some measures of the faculties for communication and or empathy, over the same period.<br>

Eh—"one causing harm, loss and pain to othesr, for no personal gain, even at a small loss, is said to act stupid; stupidity is not low IQ or lacking rational faculties, but lacking morals; thinking of something bad as being good; it's also more a collective phenomenon than and individual one, a mind virus".

If true—and IK we are unlikely to learn any time soon beyond balance-of-probability type judgement call—and given no-one was punished, both for the initial crime and especially the subsequent coverup, presumably the next Covid, say Covid-29, is being cooked in BSL-x labs as we are writing this.<br>
Ngl imo at this point only Nuremberg-style trials will do. To drill into the thick thick skulls of the politicians and bureaucrats and—the most disappointig of all!—scientists, in power and yet to come, a healthy fear from the wrath of a revolting public.<br>
While accidents do happen, this particular lab leaking was not unexpected. The "I'm The Science" cabal in positions of power betrayed us, abused our trust. They said one thing in public, then said  opposite things in private between themselves. They conspired like mafiosi. Punishment is warranted.<br>

But yeah—I'm surprised how blaze X has been refusing to give us tools (not solving the problem themselves—just giving us humans tools!) to curate our own feeds?<br>
Doubly surprised, b/c 1) Once us humans in a distributed manner do initial pass on filtering, X can train models; and 2) Bots don't have bank accounts, they will hurt X $$$ ultimately. Even if short-term bots may boost human engagement, humans learn about the bots, then disengage.<br>

Neither am I. I got and like my roof solar and battery. The self-use is about 40%. (with extra battery may get to 50%-considering...) That's average, over the year, with extremes - worst in winter 0%, best in summer 100%.<br>
It was a good learning experience too. I refreshed my EE-knowledge: 1) Everything that is consumed must be produced, supply matching demand, not on average over a day or an hour—but every moment every second of every day. 2) Go reminded to mind my difference between - a kWh of energy, from a MW of power. And 3) the fun with the "three phases" of electricity.<br>
Having said that. Instead of pocketing their victory and moving on with their lives, the Puritan NetZero Taliban seem hell bent on destroying us and destroying their achievement too in the process it seems?? For every subsequent halving of what remains, costs about as much as all the prior investment up to that point.<br>

Saw it was "Everything is a computer" appreciation day yesterday. People chiming out of their cuckoo clocks, announcing a transition away from the mechanistic universe. TBS if one-off before retreating back to the safety of their mechanistic toys, or a wider mind shift—a new meme finally taking hold of our heads.<br>
Atm computer and computing is the best abstraction we got at our disposal. Computer is the latest-greatest, most powerful. Ofc we should use it. It would be silly not to.<br>
I can see how and why we people object to changing metaphors: "The wheel" → "The word" → "Mechanical clock" → "Computer." But to my mind—doh, of course we update our model of the world around us. (NB: We're talking about our model of the world, not the world itself. Good to keep a bit of distance at all times, not get too uppity; it keeps us on our toes.) Would we prefer we didn't? My only objection is it takes us an awfully long time, tbh! (pic with chronology)<br>
Everything is best abstracted by the most powerful machine we have at our disposal at any given time. (like using a bigger model that fits better.) A computer is a better abstraction than a mechanical clock for the Universe. The mechanical clock was better than "The word," and "The word" was better than "The wheel." That’s presumably why we switch—each new abstraction serves us better. It's not a slight on humanity—it's the ok thing to do.<br>
I would dearly like to know what comes after the computer? (even if already privileged to see the "everything is computer" in my lifetime.) Yeah "we made sand think" is much joy and fun, but nagging suspicion "The computer" will soon be shown inadequate. For that process of humanity fitting ever bigger and better model to the world around us, while still falling short too, is also telling us: the world around us is still more powerful! (and interesting.)<br>

I can't, sorry. There is not one single way afaik. There was rarely complete language support that solves all issues completely in the past. Maybe things are better now. In absence of complete language, database etc support everywhere, one fallbacks to self-discipline.<br>
Personally, I got a rule to have in the name of a datetime type variable some indication, say _UTC or _Local, to indicate to the reader, (probably future me,) that I have thought about the TZ issue. And what I decided, what's the resolution, what kind of datetime is in that variable.<br>
If it's not indicated, I'd assume UTC. But maybe also a code smell, that the code writer didn't consider the TZ. If _Local, then I have to find a way to carry the info to what location of that locality is. To record the "Europe/London" elsewhere in some way. If _UTC, then there is no need for that.<br>
My point was that I've found that I it's useless to record BST or GMT as that is almost never needed. Ofc, one can convert from "Europe/London", and map that to "BST" (1/2 of the year, when we have DST in force), or "GMT" (the other 1/2 of the year, when we have regular time or winter time without DST). But my point is-we almost never care about that the timezone. Usually, it's either "UTC", or "local" and what "location" it is at.<br>

Tbh on their recent track records, Oxford PhD economics grad, and executive director at Goldman Sachs, is as much a disqualifier, as it is a qualifier. The attributes indicate a person energetic and capable—yes. But for doing things bad as well as for doing things good. I have to admit without any joy of seeing it that way. (even a tinge of sadness.) Carney was not a great success as a BoE governor.<br>

Yes, sort of. We need both. Choice looks orthogonal to certainty to me.<br>
We need certainty to survive. To keep on living—we need air and heath every second, food and water every day. We need certainty. Too much uncertainty there kills us, we can only tolerate a limited amount of uncertainty there.<br>
But we need choice to develop, for there to be something rather than nothing in the first place. That is needed upstream from us. That choice is what ultimately makes it possible for us to be born in the first place.<br>

Absolutely. Everything is a computer. Information theory is the most general theory we got. Knowledge is a p.d.f. Learning is acquiring a p.d.f. where previously we lacked one. Figuring out what, and how many of it. Computing is taking our knowledge, the learned p.d.f.s we got, and manipulating those p.d.f.s by either marginalisation, or conditioning, to create new p.d.f.s. These new p.d.f.s then tell us something about what what we care about but we can't observe, having observed things that are easy for us to observe, but we don't care about.<br>

Thanks, interesting, will read. To my mind, knowledge is specifying a probability density function p.d.f.  A re-normalised histogram of qualities, where we count which ones, and how many of which one. And quality is one dimension out of N in an N-dimensional vector space.<br>

I meant: we are used to e.g. N=3, where we get data points in the middle. There centrality measures as representative single value as a proxy for the distribution makes sense.<br>
But for high-N, in that average central middle, there are not many points. Nothing in the centre is representative of the distribution. But we still compute the centre and treat it as if it's a representative value for the distribution.<br>
The analogy in 2D would be—say we have a bi-modal pdf, with two distinct but about equal mass bumps, some distance from each other. We compute the mean as a representative value. It falls right between the two bumps. So a very improbable value. Yet—we still treat that mean as a representative value for the pdf.<br>

It's silly DOGE concentrated on the least important stuff (saving some $$$, of which USG is never short off-that's what the deficit is for, and is inconsequential). Too bad Musk is a cretin when it comes to gov-anything, basically in a "Your country is not a company"-way.<br>

Normies think they are replying to a computer, to a machine, not to another human. They feel nothing about the other side. Like talking to their oven-silly, right? From PoV on the other/receiving side, that way to relate comes over as rude. Even if I know it's unintentionally so.<br>
Nerds know but also feel, that there is a human on the other side. Treat the conversation like conversing with a real human on the other side. (modulo the role the medium plays; latency expectations e.g. voice-now, sms-10 min, chat-1 hour, email-1 day.) Further  human they know, not a random stranger. If they are rude-it's intentional.<br>

The politicians not only don't fear the wrath of the public. They hold us the public in contempt.<br>
Lying mercilessly to the public and in industrial quantities used to be  the Soviet Union playbook. Now it seems that cancer has spread West. Something more radical needed to concentrate the minds of politicians and civil servants. They lack fear of God anymore, with all of us not believing the white bearded Santa in the skies anymore. But they must be made to fear what comes after they stop being in power, if they are to transgress. Atm they are not punished. So they will continue with more of the same.<br>

Hey, recently I saw this nugget. And I know it's unwise to use the H-word online. But this seems to be a genuine historic record.<br>
@ 16' by the excellent @TimothyDSnyder, in "A Speech to Europe 2019", the "Ecological panic" (tc in link) -<br>
<p><br>
<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=7zs41CkIjRw&t=960s">https://youtube.com/watch?v=7zs41CkIjRw&t=960s</a><br>
"... Ecological Panic. Hitler's argument for why Germany had to seize what they needed before others could. Hitler said specifically that science and technology will not rescue us, we must take from others. Ecological panic. The second overall cause of the Holocaust is dehumanisation. The idea that since we must take from others, others are only valuable in so far as they can serve us".<br>
Now the speaker was using this as an argument for more panic imo. Of the type of "the world is falling/burning/crashing/drowning" which I did not quite understand. Like-surely the message should be exactly the opposite. Don't do a-hitler. Don't scare people Savanarola-style with end-of-world prophesies.<br>
We have had the experience of the last 80 yrs, where the world warmed up at a rate of 1.2C/century. So we should not be complacent, but neither should we lose our heads in panic. Imo the message should have been: Do encourage people to use their rational faculties. Do not give up on the idea of technology will rescue us. In fact-little else in history has rescued us from the predicaments of the human condition, but technology. So-maybe even double down on technology! To lead us out of the valley of tears.<br>

Ofc. What other better abstraction we got at our disposal atm? Computer is the latest-greatest, most powerful. Ofc we are to use it.<br>
Everything can be best abstracted with the most powerful machine we got at any given time. (like a bigger model that can be made to fit better.) Computer is a better abstraction then a mechanical clock for the Universe. And mechanical clock was better than "the word". And "the word" was better than "the wheel". So what comes after the computer, will improve on that. It's not a slight on humanity-it's the reasonable thing to do.<br>
And yet and yet-it's still inadequate, right? So that process of humanity fitting ever bigger and better model to the world around us, while still falling short of perfection, is also telling us: the world around us is more powerful! (still!?)<br>

Doubt it will get to agreeing even the 30 days. More likely, Russia will come back with some condition, like "Zelensky is to resign", or "Ukraine to disband half the army", as a pre-condition to cease-fire.<br>
Remember: always demand everything, don't ask, demand. Do not back down. If you persevere long enough, there will always appear someone, on the other side, that will give you 1/2, or 1/4, of what you demand. Then you will end up pocketing that 1/2 or 1/4, even before any negotiations start.<br>
That's how you end up with the largest land mass in the whole world, as your country. Always demand more. Do not ask-demand. Sounds crazy (to aim for more land), but also reasonable (if you only care about the land and nothing else).<br>

That maybe, but it's not the only thing.<br>
Those around him see strong USD a benefiting Wall Street, but disbenefiting re-industrialisation. Weaker USD is also part of the plan. Also "Trump crazy"-sell-US/D is a factor pushing in the direction of the plan.<br>
Same reason they got nothing against the USG backed crypto scheme. Say USG had a USD 1:1 backed stable coin. (USC? USN?) Then foreigners holding USD outside of the US (another factor pushing for US budget deficits), can be incentivised to sells USD buy USN (the USG coin), thus pushing for lower fx for USD. (also easing pressure on USG budget deficit)<br>
And of course weaker USD makes imports more expensive, reduces imports. And the usual risk of importing inflation via importing more expensive energy is mitigate by US being largely energy self-sufficient. (even exporting)<br>

It's unfortunate that our intuition about how the space fills, that we build on examples from our physical world where N=2 or N=3, is not only inadequate, but outright deceptive to us. Those things for high-N, stand exactly the opposite, to how they are, for low-N. Various measures of centrality, that we think of as representative, are actually not representing what we hope they are.<br>
In N-dimensional space, for sufficiently large N, every N-point, is an outlier. In that N-space, the space moves in the corners. There is little space left in the centre. We know this from seeing the ratio of N-ball to N-cube N-volume measures drop quickly towards zero with increasing N.<br>

Sure, but "no benign" does not equal "end of the world with 100% certainty by year 2125". Further, the logic connecting the outcome to the present actions via the the "precautionary principle" is just that, a general "principle", a guide, a "rule of thumb".<br>
Using the same principle and "no benign" and the same weak logic I can just about justify everything. People just use that to propose "solutions" that solve nothing. That are their favourite hobby horses that do not solve whatever problem they have in mind. That's a poor way to lead. The elite should not be putting personal whims as a top priority.<br>
And in the process, re-running a chain similar to hitlerian 1-2-3 Lebensraum ecological panic logic outlined in the TDS speech. Now re-reading the chain, I see even "the ends justify the means". That should trigger alarm bells in us, strikes me being a bad idea. For ends that are in the future, "I beseech you think it possible you may be mistaken" always comes to my mind.<br>
UK we run the experiment of decarbonising our electricity grid in the past 15yrs. The results are in. Households and businesses have had their bills triple. Imo that's a major factor in being on track to elect as PM our very own Trump-like caesar in 3 years time. There is no country in the world that is both rich, and does not use much energy.<br>
UK could have done what France did half a century ago and decarbonised electricity with nuclear. Proven technology, cheaper than our current one, works without question, zero carbon. But, when choosing between a solution, and a hobby horse, our innumerate leaders went for the fashion of the day.<br>
Wind and solar are expensive when the need to be 100% reliable is factored in. Hence the need for subsidies etc. I have rooftop solar + batteries myself, know my kWh energy from MW power, know that national grid needs to balance every second of every day. There is not one country in the whole world, with *both* significant wind+solar *and* cheap electric energy. Not one.<br>
(side note: I see you are using Grok to expand your thinking, and I commend that; you may want to check magisterial @karpathy tutorials on "how should I think about these things given how they work under the hood" aimed any non-specialist us, this https://youtube.com/watch?v=7xTGNNLPyMI and the next one too; they are long but worth it and can be watched in start-pause instalments)<br>

Yes but the non-linear tipping points are the hardest to predict so while certainly they are not impossible—it's impossible to forecast them with any accuracy. In the end forecasting ends up equivalent to "8B will die, therefore anything I want done is moral imperative we should do it no questions asked".<br>
The idea "no benign warming" invites "benign to whom?" Obviously Earth had periods with higher CO2 and higher temperature and plenty of life on Earth. The fossil fuels we are digging out and whose CO2 we are returning back into the atmosphere by burning them—come from such high CO2 periods.<br>
IMO when forecasting the more prudent, the less exciting, the more accurate. I'd stick to the IPCC reports about possible consequence. Tipping points etc are low probability high consequence events similar to asteroid hitting Earth, nuclear war etc. About zero confidence of accuracy of such forecasts tbh. I do forecasting for a living so got some appreciation of the challenges for these specific types of future events.<br>

Bad morals, not low IQ. Bad moral values. Think of the absent father situation of all these remote-conception children. What does a kid want and need most from a parent? Love. How is love communicated? By spending time with them, giving them our time. In a way—our time & attention is the most sincere gift to give.

We have had 1.2C-per-100-years degrees warming in the past 80yrs, and we are not dead yet. So yeah—various bad things may happen in the future, but also it's possible they will not. Our world now is better in many ways to the world 80yrs ago when I look at the Our World In Data collected stats.<br>
For all the catastrophists I think—have you considered that your forecast about the future maybe wrong? What is the cost then? Assuming 8B billion will be dead is a very comfortable position to be in for the person making the claim. Because then—anything is justified.<br>
Not just justified—but a moral imperative. Murder 4B in order to save 4B Thanos style? Justified—but notice how it hinges on being 100% correct forecast about the future. And future by definition can never be forecast by 100% certainty. So no—I'm not in favour of that kind of thinking, sorry.<br>

Your are similarly wrong now thinking Russia will ever cross over to your side. The military exercise in the title is not "despite", but "because". Reagan had the right idea. All admins since have been wrong. All too soft, as shown by zero results from their "resets". Trump will get the same result, pursuing the same policy.<br>

Thanks for that! Interesting so far - but will have to listen again. (oow-now Leszek Kolakowski quote in the end; loved "Heavens' keys" and "Conversations With the Devil" ages ago)<br>
Have all the time in the world for @TimothyDSnyder. Read "Bloodlands" and liked it. Listening to his speech, I thought "Hitler's Empire" was his, but suspecting "is it?" and checking now I find and also remembered it's by Mark Mazower. (also recommend)<br>
Had forgotten about The Third Reich being an empire, but of course it was. In his speech, noticed this - 1) Hitler expanded the Lebensraum b/c of ecological panic 2) Ecology was bad and science and technology was not going to solve it; so 3) Germans had to take from others.<br>
So while agree with his view. In my mind, his historic lesson additionally resonated additionally with this: by creating an ecological panic around global warming, the more quasi-religious fringes of the modern ecological movements that reject any hint of technological solution and adaptation are "history riming not repeating". For the cost of their "solutions" that don't actually solve anything, is driving the voters in the warm bosoms of the Caesars TDS rightly badmouths and fears.<br>

Ah, you mean following 4K accounts is too many. Yes I agree. It happens this way.<br>
When I think something is worth forwarding, I typically click Follow this account. My thinking is - if they wrote something I found worth enough to forward, it was something interesting to me, and if they did it in the past, maybe they will do it in the future.<br>
Now, most of the time that does not pan out. So I'd have to go through the list, and Unfollow some past accounts. And I do from time to time, open the list of Follows, and ask myself "do I recall this account, do I remember reading something interesting", and where the answer is No, I Unfollow.<br>
However, it's a chore, uninteresting manual labour, so not done very often. Plus, I noticed that X Algofeed has become more atuned to my interests. So out of 100 accounts, the algofeed will show me posts from 30 that interest me. I don't have to unfollow the other 70 to tell the algofeed "don't show me their posts".<br>
I only have to keep curating the say 5-10 out of 100 that I disagree with, annoy me, or I would not willingly chose to read as they are less than pleasant to my current thinking, but still interesting from some angle from my PoV. The 5-10% of disagreeable content one is to let in the own bubble to be able to change with times and avoid being totally closed chamber. (and end insane)<br>

Researching the past is better than not researching, but it means little. Certainly less than people assume.<br>
In the future: 1) Your FH may turn decide to extort you, where they didn't in the past; 2) The MA they appoint may change, start extorting you; 3) The FH may change too! (the freehold maybe sold)<br>
So the cries of "Buyer beware" are not the silver bullet many hope they will be. Better to tell the buyer upfront: someone else will be writing the bills, and you will be paying them. Or else...<br>

Thanks! Oh yes please feel free to throw back some references at me. Recently I became aware of existence of Karl Friston theories after watching a podcast. As far as ML parts go—all he said about the mechanisms, all that has "probability density" in there, makes perfect send to me.<br>
I have been told "the joint probability density function between two variables X and Y captures everything that there is ever to be known about the relation between those X and Y" 25 years ago by a friend, and have been thinking on those terms ever since.

Well—if in the real world, which is a gigantic organism of its own, it's of benefit for distributed network of independent things to exists, rather than one single blob, then: it should not be improbable, for the same to be true for thy way our brain works. For there to be an advantage, to for the brain to be architected as collection of semi-independent agents, that work independently, on their own, and then at the end one collects and collates the final result. Call that one final agent node—our conscious self. There—mystery solved. 😂 joke, joke (about solved)—but not out of mind crazy, no?<br>

I can not comprehend how random SV person worth >$100M can complain muh-no-FU-muh. The idea is not that speaking your mind costs 0. The idea is that there is monetary $$$ cost to speaking the truth in the company of liars—but you can take the hit! That's what FU money is for. To absorb that hit. For that hit to not delete you. You still live another day, you can still speak your mind.<br>
The SV dudes strike me as clutching their pearls too tightly. Let go of those pearly $$$ - that's what they are for. To buy you that freedom—to speak you mind.<br>
Of course that doesn't say anything much about the ideas spoken—only that the ideas are unpopular, ostracised. But doesn't say if the ideas are good or bad, clever or stupid, interesting or boring. That would be asking too much of a simple device that FU money is, tbh.<br>

I think European's paranoia comes from their position of weakness. Europeans genuinely lack their own weapons for their own defence. A generation of feeble, dunder-headed, low-energy leaders exposed their citizens to a number of risks—energy, defence, etc. Only France has done it right. Poland, the Nordics, Germany—they need not only conventional weapons, but their own nuclear deterrent too. I can't imagine US going to nuclear exchange with Russia, if Russia were to nuke Warsaw. And if I can't—I imagine plenty of others can't too, including plenty in Russia. Once deterrent is not credible—it's not a deterrent any more, there is none.<br>

I'm of course ignorant to any non-public information. IDK what the current issues are, what the disagreements are.<br>
To me Ukraine insisting on "security guarantees" (whatever that is) seems silly. Anything signed on paper at present, only weakly binds anyone in the future anyway. And especially with a "might is right", "what cards you got to play" Trump-like admin/president/party. Ukr can do as Putin does: sign whatever, then do whatever you want anyway, regardless of what's signed.<br>
Obviously Russia could just pause attacking, starting tonight, and peace will arrive. But reasoning from first principles: Putin is safe and sound while Russia is at war. So I don't see why Putin would be stopping this war. Or any war.<br>
Publicly I see zero US pressure on Russia to stop. And pressure on Ukraine is implicit encouragement to Russia to keep up with the attacks and keep the war going imo.<br>

Support for Ukraine, and possibly Europe, is in the past. Before MAGA run the US. That was a different US it seems to me.<br>
After all—if US decides to extort UK with "give me X or your planes will not fly", what cards does UK hold? Don't see many.<br>

Yes both sides are apart, and drifting further away fast.<br>
Similar the way Americans think "lack of appreciation, no `thank you`-s", Europeans think "Russia will be bombing our cities and Americans will be at best standing neutral, at worst helping Russia outright".<br>
I read of US effectively disabling F16-s donated to Ukraine by European countries. I though at once—they could do the same to the UK, (where I live) while we are under attack of Russian rockets. This is not something you'd think and worry about.<br>
It's not trivial putting oneself in others shoes and getting their PoV. Airing disagreements in public is the surest way to amplify them.<br>

🤣 haha - v.funny! @ LJ: explain difference between private and public debt.<br>
LJ: in the real world where some of us lived and traded through GFC'08, and have memory longer than of a gold fish, the 2008 crisis happened b/c private debt. Private, not public.<br>
Private loans given by private banks and shadow banking institutions to private borrowers went bad. Mostly predictably b/c they were bad loans to not credit-worthy borrowers. The oldest story in the book. The subsequent contagion when no-one could tell which bank is going to stand and which is going to fall, caused most of the banking sector to effectively go bust.<br>
And looked like "this sucker is going down" (GWB) taking with it the real economy too. Step in the public bailing out private banking and other private industries with guarantees, loans, bailouts etc.  In summary, it was private, not public debt, that went bad.<br>
I like Dalio and recommend his "How the Economic Machine Works" animated 20 min movie as it's really good about the mechanics of markets and role of debt. But as with many financiers, he too, despite all his radical transparency self-critique maoist BS, has somewhat self-serving blind spot when ti comes to private/public debt differences.<br>

The opposing camps are forever telling only 1/2 of the story. The complete story is: 99.9% alternative new upstart etc ideas turn out to be wrong.

Why? I can think of—<br>
1) Unaccountability Machine. Avoid accountability while still wielding most of the power. Plausible deniability. Can outsource to them things I'm pressured to do, should do, is the right thing to do, but I the minister don't want to do. (for whatever reason)<br>
2) Cronyism, corruption. Bungs for in-group I-scratch-your-back-you-mine, friends, even family, soft over the table corruption conveyor belt. Especially when further institutionalised and commercialised via NGO Limited companies. (can imagine further step—corporatisation and financialization, haha 😄)<br>
3) Blair trying to get things done. The civil service and bureaucracy will frustrate a reformer. Quick solution—build alternative structures, devolve power to them, fill them with energetic acolytes. Will get things done short term. Trouble is—without any feedback loop whatsoever, this system veers off course pretty quick.<br>

If UK needed to launch our own satellite independently, would we be able to? Like France did yesterday. If UK needed targeting data b/c Russia decided to teach us a lesson. Would UK be able to operate our own jets, when US decides to shutdown support like with European F16-s donated to Ukraine? If France-launches-military-satellites-in-space-but-UK-unable parochial competition does not spur UK into action towards more independent minded security, IDK what will. 😆 Kind of hopium that after 1939-41 and Suez, UK was—"yeah we can rely on US just fine".<br>

Yes, true. But nothing lasts forever. It's the end of the post WW2 ordering, where USA (claimed) to be prepared to wage nuclear war against the Soviet Union invading (West) Germany and France, and the SU believed that US claim.<br>
Now Germany and Poland will need to get their own nuclear deterrent. One way or another. That's ultimately the only protection against Russia invasion. For in a war between nuclear and non-nuclear state, the nuclear can only draw or win, and the non-nuclear can only draw or lose. So a nuclear state once it shifts into predatory mode (Russia Putin imperial, US Trump transactional) will act on that obvious incentive.<br>
Yes, that increases some risks. Nuclear Armageddon remains one of the two major risks. (the other one—much worse covid like world wide pandemic)<br>

Noticed half-dozen examples of a pattern: 1) USG claims C on some topic [2) presume Musk trusts USG] 3) turns out USG claim C was wrong, even deliberate lie 4) Musk conclusion: "whatever USG says on the topic, multiply by -1". But that's wrong. If I don't trust USG, my correlation to their claims should be 0, not -1. Or rather, when assessing probability of a claim C, should be P(C)=P(C|USG opined on C). I distrust USG, so it opining on C changes not at all my belief about C.<br>

Fwiw I think Poland acquiring nuclear deterrent reduces the probability of nuclear war. If they do it-that is. (thus far Europeans lacked will even if the writing was on the wall for some time.)<br>
Scenario. Lacking deterrent, emboldened Greater Russia 1st invades the Baltics. US huffs and puffs, but  does nothing much. Then, by now reckless drunk on success, Russia invades Poland too.<br>
At this point US gets involved. A hot war between Russia and US starts that way. It may end in nuclear exchange.<br>

Exactly this. Elites got into their heads the idea that general public are imbeciles who can't hold more than a single idea in their heads. So it has to be either 100% good, or 100% bad. (for reasons more self-serving than usually admitted)<br>
Now, of course the average person is not a rocket scientist. (and half are dumber than that) Still, they can hold the idea that there are pros- and cons- both to interventions, and to doing nothing. The average person can handle the idea of gives-and-takes just fine.<br>
We know this for sure. Because people already do that with any number of things. And for things that really do matter to them, and where large enough group of people are informed, even if a majority are uninformed, groups regularly do great. (The Wisdom of Crowds) All it takes is for the ignorant to decide independently, and their errors will cancel out.<br>
When they don't decide independently, but follow each others, errors are all one sided and don't cancel out. Then we have collective stupidity overwhelm collective intelligence. (Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the Madness of Crowds)<br>

In the UK we are not ignoring. UK invested a lot in green stuff. We tripled our electricity cost in 15 yrs.<br>
That's enough now. To govern is to choose. And short- to mid- term there are more important things. If that means in 100yrs Manchester will have Milan weather—so be it.<br>
UK must drop the green cr*p now, modify and or repeal the NetZero laws. We are ruled by lawyers—hope they are competent enough to be able to pass/change the laws.<br>
UK must build-build-build, more of everything and starting with housing. And for that to happen, everything else must take a 2nd seat. UK needs cheap energy. Drop net0 now.<br>

He is "stupid". On the Cippola meaning of stupid: stupid person causes loss, pain, suffering to others, for no gain to himself, even a small loss. His stupidity comes not from low IQ or especially lacking rational faculties, but from lack of morals. Or a different set of morals<br>

Humans are quite shite in many areas. Mostly ones in position to measure and give feedback are not incentivised enough to do so. So they they don't.<br>
Again and again we find that people have inflated sense of their abilities. Answers to questions like "could you wrestle a bear", or "could you win a game of tennis against Serena Williams" etc. (there's is a positive there that people try even at low odds, and sometimes get lucky)<br>

Of course.<br>
Even in the 1990s, immediately after becoming free again, (with the withdrawal of the Soviet Union armies,) they were talking "either in NATO, or we develop own detterence". That was "their card", and Clinton having some US State he needed to win in elections with a large Polish diaspora.<br>
People speaking now as if NATO wanted to expand are delusional. In fact, the existing members refused to admit new countries. And especially US was reluctant. Only after badgering and pleading for a few years, and with US fearing nuclear proliferation, were the Central and East European countries admitted to NATO.<br>
Now no one in Europe thinks US will fight Russia and risk nuclear Armageddon when Russia invades the Baltics, and then Poland. Or any country in Europe.<br>
People talking as if Art.5 is some magic weapon shielding them form Russia assault. It's a single word. Members promise they will "help" when one of them is attacked. That's it, one word, "help".<br>
So Poland, Finland, the Baltics, the Nordica, ofc need their own detterence. Germany too. They should have started thinking about it the 1st time Trump was elected. And started working on them for sure since Feb-2022.<br>
Europeans had a generation of lazy, feeble minded, entitled leaders. If not outright foreign aligned agents as leaders. (khmMerkelkhm) But now it's clear to all. They need to be able to defend themselves from Russia alone. Possibly even with US allayed with Russia against Europe.<br>

Ego. "I", and "the-world-ex-I", have not separated. As babies we can't make distinction between "I" and "everything-else-ex-I" initially, it's all the same to us. Then, in time, we learn of the separation. (can say that-death is the maximum of that.) But narcissists don't learn.<br>

Exactly! It's pointless asking any promises of Trump. As his admin will simply not deliver on them.<br>
IMO Ukraine should do the same as Trump and Putin do: sign whatever in bad/no faith. Then mostly ignore, or not, whichever way is opportune to advance their own strength.<br>
Trump doesn't care either way. As long as there is PR news story out there to be told. Putin will do as before, whatever is signed, and continue working on taking over Ukraine. Ukraine lose nothing, if they are bound by nothing. They win getting Trump off their backs.<br>

The part of leftism you intuitively feel is right but you don't articulate  is the "slave morality" we all get from Christianity: to suffer is ok, even good. And for the few real beleviers-even virtuous.<br>
It is indeed a successful organising principle. For in the group dynamics, 90% is cooperation, and only 9% is competition. And in that 9% of activity where we complete, there will be few winners, and many losers.<br>
So indeed to alienate the many, for the benefit of few, is indeed bonkers, it is stupid. For the benefit of the few that are already the winners. 🏆 Winners already get societal prizes like goods, money, get attention, sex, etc - whatever we humans crave.<br>
And are denied only one single piece. A symbolic thing, a gold star, ⭐ a medal🥇 of no real practical consequence: being called "good". Rather- that symbolic prize is awared to the losers. The losers, that let us remember, got nothing else.<br>
Every once in a while, an elite comes along, that is so narcissistic, so insecure, so craven, so ill adjusted, so unaware of this setup-that can't take that symbolic loss. Being denied the designation "good".<br>
So in a monster toddler tantrum, the narcissist elite decide to torch everything, burn everything down. Flip the morals, so "winning is good and virtuous", losing is bad, and now the "good" boy gold 🪙 star is to belong to them. In the process,<br>
to flip to "master morality", they have to tear down the institutions, destroy the government, abolish governance.<br>
We are in that moment now. Musk is the face of the toddler acting the monster tantrum irl.<br>

From UK-Europe PoV looks like US is aligning with Russia and in due course will be EU-China vv. US-Russia. With UK TBS if Airstrip1 or in EU camp.<br>
Russia love of Moscow Mule Muskians looks the weak bet there. Russia not Soviet Union. Is 1/2 SU in people and territory. Lacking universalist ideology. (SU communism discredited only late, asset for long time) Produces nothing of value sought by any neighbour. (like Saudi Arabia.) Hydrocarbons an asset, but ever less so. Between Russia energy and not being killed by Russia, most opt for the latter. Alternatives be sought and found. Make do with less. It's not forever. Stone age didn't end for lack of stones.<br>
Central-East Europe stronger now than in 1939-1945, should resist Russia Orc. Inspired by Ukraine "give me freedom of give me death" stand. Germany and France both on the same Europe side.<br>

Yeah—with the persons like @ MsMarkievitz, I have learned<br>
1) They are "stupid" on Cippola's definition of stupidity—"with their actions stupid person will cause great harm and pain to others, while deriving no gain for themselves, even at a small personal loss".<br>
2) This is *not* low IQ or lack of rational faculties! (to be fair to the minority unfortunate retarded people that have genuine hardware faults.) If interested for more—look up Bonhoeffer.<br>
3) The root cause of stupidity is morals. These people lack morals. What they think is good, the rest of us think it bad. (and vice versa)<br>
Or one can even say: they have a different moral code.<br>
Our currently prevalent moral code is "slave morality": Christianity-based moral code, where to suffer is virtuous and to be poor and powerless is not a sin. It's even good.<br>
Alternative moral code would be pagan and e.g. Roman "master morality": to be powerful is good, to be powerless is bad. Poor and feeble deserve their fate, for they are bad people. The ones with power are good people. (might is right)<br>
4) It's a social phenomenon mostly, a "mind virus" even.<br>

@ MsMarkiewicz<br>
On the contrary—I have seen wars, I don't want to fight wars, I don't want my sons to fight wars.<br>
One side not wanting a war is not sufficient for avoiding war, unfortunately. If it were, there would have been World Peace upon us already.<br>
So the 2nd best option to deter the side that is preparing to attack you, or talking about attacking you—by arming yourself to the teeth. Russia is attacking Europe and UK daily already. In their minds they are already at war with the UK.<br>
In that scenario, re-building Europe armies is the way to deter. (maybe) Conventional armies for sure. Even if 3 years late. And Europe needs to expand the nuclear arsenal too. Poland + Baltics + Nordics need to get independent nuclear deterrent imo.<br>
Putin—and his successor—will likely 1) absorb Ukraine, esp the battle hardened army; 2) position pro-Kremlin president of Belarus (after Lukashenka croaks); 3) have Greater Russia uniting all (incl Moldova); 4) likely invade the Baltics (alt: Romania, Bulgaria—if political opening there)<br>

Да, вреди дали се секираш и за таа варијанта. Еве предложи што tribute, што е нешто што Путин сака или му треба, може Македонија да му даде? Што е еквивалентно на Алшари и сл прикаски? Не мора да е којзнае колку реално, доволни е идеа со некој потенцијал или сл.<br>
Бугарија и за САД и за Русија стално ќе биде поважна од Македонија. Русија со војна е и скоро основач на модерната Бугарската држава, удел во азбуката, па може да се каже и во модерната нација. За Русија ми личи, дека на Балкан по интерес се 1-Бугарија, па 2-Србија, па 3-Грција. Тешко да се пробие Македонија и на позиција 3, а не па погоре.<br>

Net zero crap, Chagos, Incapacity benefits, Mobility luxury cars. After 30 sec deliberation from the top of my head.<br>
Next bring inhouse any number currently outsourced services that are just leaking pounds like sieves, are feeding frenzies for contractors, poor value for the rest of us.<br>
Next shutdown or rather bring back quangos into the public sector. Shutdown the Unaccountability Machine. Stop the bungs for friends & family conveyor belt. Most eggreguous examples-jail a few ministers. When did UK last jail one for corruption?<br>
Next put through Parliament the @lfg_uk Looking For Growth draft law.<br>
Next repeal or severely curtail Towns and etc Planning act restricting building. If X wants something built on their land, and Y wants to prevent that-than if Y wins by law in court etc, then it has to pay compensate X for opportunity cost. That will concentrate minds.<br>
Next end Leasehold insanity. Stop 5M people worrying about that semi-criminal enterprise and let them be productive members of society. ECHR challenge? Put carve-outs through in Parliament in a single session.<br>
Or get out of ECHR all together if the lawyers that occupy the commanding heights of UK society are unable or unwilling to make it work for the majority of the UK. Next time a ridiculous sentence like "community service for theft #200, we expect him to not steal for 201-st time" is in the media, the Chief Justice or whoever is their boss and top dog in the judiciary branch: bring him in Parliament, for public grilling, to explain it to a Parliamentary Commission or some such.<br>
The taxes are ATH, state spending at ATH, yet nothing works. Of course that means money badly spent. Victorians built more, with much less money, and much worse technology. I do not accept that contemporary brittons are stupider than their predecessors or lazier or can't do stuff. That is *not* the case. It's not about left or right. It's about basic state competencies.

За да почне да плете добри фантастични приказни. Нешто скриени злата на Александар, микс со прастари рудници, плус Алшари ретки минерали невидени непознати богатства. (ама за беља ете закопани во земја, нешто така; како Литиум Србија) Може и да врзат со камената вселенска опсерваторија. Тука нешто и со AI, па Портали, паралелни светови и слично.<br>
Па ако се случи нешто неочекувано, некако Бугарија, Грција, Албанија да се договорат (не верувам, ама за секој случај) "конечно да го решат македонското прашање". Ако се случи да бараме воена помош и војска од САД, да има МКД tribute, нешто за давање, што може да му се понуди даде во залог на Трамп. Како Украинците со нивните "ретки руди и минерали".<br>
Може ако има некои од тие клик-спамерите од Велес (со рекламен $$$ од фејк њуз "Breaking! Папата Умре!") ако ги има уште, од нив да ангажираат за кампања на Фејсбук, Трамп Соушал. Може сега најново некој shitcoin нешто крипто да направат, па и така да вложат во ликот и делото на Трамп. Може тоа и најефективно, best value for money. Да вложи MKD $100М од државен буџет во некоја "стратегиска крипто резерва" на Трамп и тоа добра инвестиција? Осигурување за секој случај, за недајбоже.<br>

I think many already do. 100K maybe seem stretch on first sight. 10K-20K Is not even logistically difficult. But consider this.<br>
Just take your public sector employes. About 10% of them are not teachers, doctors, policeman but various pen-pushers of no consequence. They can be hired-fired on the strength of their party loyalty. Select 10% of them that are in-confidence-enough, able and willing. That's 1% of the public sector workforce. Assign 10 accounts to each. Multiply by the known size of public sector in various countries.<br>
Now 100K does not look out of reach for many countries, no?<br>
It annoys me to no extent the there is no market mechanism to compel Zucks and Musks of the Tech to offer optional 1) realHumanIRL; and or 2) realHuman; 3) filtering/selection on 1&2 yes/no.<br>
I am fine with pseudo/anonymous and all manner of accounts, I'm not advocating for any compulsory ID by anyone, not on X, not on the Web, not on the Internet. (and I'm against compulsory ID cards in the UK; whenever that topic arises)<br>
I'm advocating for 1) on X only 2) accounts that *do want themselves* do have *real person* verified by X, 3) for X to have a process to do that, 4) for accounts that want it themselves; and 5) I as a user of whatever designation - free, premium, premium+, verified or not, to 6) have tools where I can filter, select etc posts and accounts on that axis of difference, verified real life/human yes/no.<br>
I already do this to some extent imperfectly by necessity via lists etc. Just advocating for X to help me a bit. I already e.g. verify my ID to my bank to use their online services. X could offer—non-compulsory, voluntary for accounts that want it—service for that.<br>
Again—voluntary, for X only, accounts that do want it themselves. Coupled with the option of others to filter select on that, yes/no optional.<br>

In the UK we are paying a price for that.<br>
I got the impression most of the activists lobbyists class don't know their kWh of energy from their MW of power, and that still have not learned and internalised that supply must balance demand every second of every day, or "very very bad things will happen".<br>
The wide pubic are of course ignorant of that, as they should be! The above is not a slight on the Great British public.<br>
The ruling elite, on the other hand, should know better. The feedback mechanism will kick in action, and lead to demise of the current established and instalment of the new incumbent elite at some point. But I fear that point will come only when the general public is alerted to the state of affairs.<br>
And that is likely to happen via a nation-wide blackout. Of the type when UK has to resort to the Dinorwig to bootstrap its National Grid back online from a total power-off. With people stranded on trains overnight, dozens in ICU dead with machines cutting off after generators run out of diesel some hours into the blackout.<br>

Now it was spelled out to me, can't stop seeing it left and right everywhere now: 😭 human stupidity is not low IQ, it's lacking in morals. It's wrongly deciding what's good, and what's bad.<br>
Forget AI for enhancing supplementing Human Intelligence, that's a sideshow. If AI can be patient and cunning enough to get into the mindset of cretins like the dude above, somehow manage to alter their value system, about what's good and what's bad, that would HUGE. Help humanity with its current predicament: too many of us are too stupid.<br>
That level of collective stupidity makes cohabitation with very large numbers of people not work. The stupid will choose a course of action that is neutral or disadvantages themselves even, while creating humongous cost and pain and suffering to scores of people around them.<br>
There are no easy solutions afaik. The stupid are genuine. The imbecile above is not faking it. He genuinely thinks mass murder of people his father happily lived with, is good. Destroying levelling cities his father built, is for the better.<br>
No not-stupid person can forecast and counter the stupidity displayed above. It will not occur to a not-stupid human to think up that kind of thinking as a possibility. It's a hard problem. 😳 Also seems of fractal nature—stupidity permeates thinking about all things, big and small. Starting with the very foundational one at the base: killing other people is wrong, isnogood. My god. 😶<br>

I read somewhere that it's part of the bot farm keeping the accounts "warm", not allowing them to go "cold". (and be detected and deleted by X? IDK, guessing here) I noticed them because they were all 0 or 1 Following or Followers, (e.g. like @ Lisafuka), but were not created in Feb-2025.<br>
Ok, re-checking now, last 3 (@ Lisafuka, Stacy_he_nu, Lesliezusu) are from [Dec-24,Jan-25]. So not that long ago. I guess they create them 1st, takes sometime to create them in bulk. Before they start using them.<br>

But even without these drugs, say if I starve myself in controlled fashion, and with exercise, there is still muscle mass.<br>
So to me "is there muscle loss" is not much of an interesting questions. We know the answer is—"yes". Yes, when I weigh 130kg I will have more muscle muss than when I weight 90kg. Even when I lose the 40kg with self-starvation.<br>
The more interesting question for me is: if I reach 90kg (from 130kg) with two methods, two routes 1) self-starving 2) Mounjaro, then which is the route, that leads to less muscle loss? (relative, absolute, combo of measures, etc)<br>

Hey thanks for the reply and the kind words.<br>
Outliers in high-dimensional spaces early indicators of emerging patters? Yes, possible. Do tell more if you can please. :-) I'll have to think about it. I have no thoughts on that at present time.<br>
Only maybe vaguely related, that I have one thought on. On the quantity->quality transition. (this "quantity->quality" I recall from high school philosophy class lifetime ago.) I've been minorly but for some time annoyed by not having good knowledge on how to say select good number of components in PCA, (and related - ICA, and other dimensionality "reduction" methods) without "rule of thumb", trial and error, "method". If this looks something that maybe relevant, read on. Otherwise, feel free to stop here now.<br>
Suppose I have a 5-dimensional observation and I'm wondering if it's really only 4 dimensions there. One way I check is - do a PCA, then look at the size of the remaining variance along the axis that is the smallest component (the one at the tail end, when sorting the PCA components by size of the variance explained). If the remaining variance is 0 for the 5-th component - that's easy, I can say: well, it was only ever a 4-dimensional observation that I had after all.<br>
However, in the real world it's never going to be exactly 0. What if it is 1e-10? 1e-1? 1? At what size does the variance along that smallest PCA axis count as an additional dimension in my data? The thresholds are domain dependent - I can for sure say that enough quantity in the extra dimension gives a rise to that new dimension, adds a new quality. Obversely - diminishing the (variance) quantity in the extra dimension removes that dimension eventually (and with total certainty at the limit of 0).<br>
I can extend the logic from this simplest case of linear dependency (where PCA suffices) all the way to to the most general case where I have a general program (instead of PCA), and the criterion is predicting forecasting the values in the extra dimension, with the associated forecasting error having the role of the variance in the PCA case. At some error quantity >0 I have to admit I have a new dimension (quality).<br>
Emergence and similar 1) where that quantity is large enough to give rise to new quality 2) this this new quality becomes a new dimension in the phenomenon investigated; my observations data goes from N-dim vector to become (N+1)-dim.<br>
("More is Different" is a succinct summary of "enough quantity becomes a new quality")<br>

In N-dimensional space, for sufficiently large N, every N-point, is an outlier. In that N-space, the space moves in the corners. There is little space left in the centre. We know this, because when looking at what happens to the ratio of N-ball to N-cube N-volume measures, we see the ratio drop quickly with increasing N.<br>
For example, in a latent N-space of say an LLM layer, where N=1K all the way to N=10K. All the data points the layer ever tunes to, will be outliers exclusively.<br>
It's unfortunate that our intuition about how the space fills, that we build on examples from our physical world where N=2 or N=3, is not only inadequate, but outright deceptive to us. Those things for high-N, stand exactly the opposite, to how they are, for low-N. Various measures of centrality, that we think of as representative, are actually not representing what we hope they are.<br>

Those around him do have a plan though it seems.<br>
Volcker 2. Tariffs instead of IR to raise prices, reduce consumption of the below median half of the country, fight inflation. Energy independence to stave off any imported inflation from weaker dollar. Shitcoins to create dollar doubt, if not competition, weaken the dollar.<br>

YT algofeed always seems to find +1 podcast about "universal unified theory this" or "quantum that". Looks to me like a crisis of reading and comprehension. Not crisis of writing? This will add to the already plentifull supply side. IDK.<br>
If it helps us with gravity, designs some wildly successful anti-gravity device or rocket engine, I guess I'd be bowed over. Something SciFi now - like changes curles space into some swirl, gravity undoes itself etc. Some magic like that.<br>
Seems to me while humanity has made inroads with electricity, magnetism, nuclear - but little progress on gravity? We are almost as shackled to Earth as Cromagnons were. Progress = devise clever trick how to lift loads off the earth, (and into space,) thousand times or million times times more efficient than currently.<br>

To me looks he wants for the war to go away, in whichever way. For fighting to stop. While cares not about what happens to Ukraine. If Russia could conquer it today, and make the problem go away that way—that'd be fine with Trump, Musk etc. That's the only consideration.<br>

One wishes—but only #1 is realistically possible.<br>
#2 Implies American soldiers dying in Ukraine. Given US loathes (and or is scared etc) to sell weapons to Ukraine, don't see how #2 is realistic.<br>
#3 Is even less likely. Putin has not given up on taking over the whole of Ukraine. That's still his aim. Given he's got US neutral now (if not outright ally) with the cut off of US weapons for Ukraine, IDK why he would give up now.<br>

Having said that. I'm not going to litigate what I wrote or didn't, with a cross between Wittgenstein and Kafka's interrogator its seems. IDK you IRL, and pseudo-anon too.<br>
In general terms, how I think of this, for the benefit of any reader. (articulated imperfectly again.) I speculate of something ("x") that happened in the recent past, that may influence something else ("y") that may or may not happen in the future.<br>
1. Some ideas exist in my head, deciding on x, y, knowing of f(x,y);<br>
2. Then my words communicate the x, y, and the change between f(y|x) and f(y);<br>
3. Then on the receiving end, in the head of the reader of these words, the words trigger: their's x, y, changes in g(y|x) and g(y).<br>
There is little chance that the identical setup exists in your head too (identical x and y, f==g). Allow for incompetence to explain what may come over to you as malice.<br>

I have yet to meet a normie, that is not completely oblivious to the fact, that the Personal/Computer revolution first, the Internet revolution next, now the AI revolution, happened were mostly done by mildly autistic and mostly altruistic nerds, for almost zero expected compensation, but the glory of creation.<br>
Normies—too selfish? too self-entitled to create something for all, for nothing? for the love of the creation, and nothing else?—do not realize what has happened. How the world they live daily in was created.<br>
Not to be too harsch—but the (non-CompSci) intelligentsia class is even more ignorant, if that's even possible?? Have yet to meet a single aspiring marxist that's ever heard of the ideas of Free and or Open Software, FSF/RMS etc.<br>

No wonder you are losing your war. What's said there is delusional. It's like when small children want the world to be as per their desires.<br>
Fossil fuels are super cheap. That's the problem with them! That's why the world can't kick them out. They are cheap and easily available.<br>
If renewables were "too cheap to meter", like your side has been saying for decades now, the switch would have happened quickly, easily, painlessly. There would be no need for extra policy—would happen on its own.<br>
Wind and solar are expensive when the need to be 100% reliable is factored in. Hence the need for subsidies etc. I have rooftop solar + batteries, know my kWh energy from MW power, know that national grid needs to balance every second of every day. There is not one country in the whole world, with BOTH significant wind+solar AND cheap electric energy. Not one.<br>
Being ignorant and innumerate is your biggest enemy.  One can think anything about Marx, but few would disagree—he was clear eyed in his analysis. His acolytes nowadays—not so much.<br>

Often we are interested only in the amplitude of the FT. We don't care about the phase. Say we take 256 numbers in time domain, do DFT, come up with another 256 numbers in FT domain, then throw away the 128 phases, and use only the 128 amplitudes.<br>
Wasteful spending processing to get 256 numbers, then throw away 1/2 of them. Hartley Transform to the rescue. It's like "FT in real domain only". Instead of DFT, we do DHT Discrete Hartley Transform. And we get our 128 amplitudes only right out. No flops wasting.<br>

Haha 😂 - good takes there! Two things.<br>
1) The retarded "low IQ" is not lack of reasoning capabilities, it's bad morals. Doing stupid is downstream from thinking good is bad, and bad is good. (from our PoV) Also facilitates "be nice again" to genuine retards with real hardware faults.<br>
I saw that argument put forward in a YT video on stupidity - Bonhoeffer‘s "Theory of Stupidity" 1) stupidity is low morals not low IQ; and 2) it's social, a mind virus (ha!-Elon!) in humans groups more than individuals. (extending Cippola's "stupid is one causing harm to others while not deriving any gain, even taking a small personal loss"; links https://x.com/ljupc0/status/1895824224029184268).<br>
2) Soviets, and then Russians inherited it, score well at anti-rationality: flood the field with sh*t, (Bannon; after Surkov) lie mercilessly destroy the possibility for there being a single truth. Industrial quantities of random cr*p do exhaust our thinking capacities.<br>
Western "useful idiot" of the old ("govnojed" in the designation of their Eastern appreciators) has been replaced by a 21-st Century "nutnik" (= nutter + vatnik) online variant.

I have considered that possibility. Yes, it's possible that that is the reason.<br>
Good. I encourage you to continue digging evidence, evidence for-, and evidence against-, that possibility. Because it's not certain. Could be as you say, could be something else. Could be both to some extent.<br>
And if you want to, you come up, or read up read on, on another possibility. And then dig for evidence for-, and evidence against-, that other possibility.<br>
Typically I try to net the evidence, as one has to weight multiple items of evidence, for each of the possibilities. To somehow  "add evidence" one on top of the other, both for- and against-. To get to some measure of "how likely it is" that the possibility is true.<br>
Then as if in a trial, but where a jury decides not "beyond reasonable doubt", but "on the balance of probabilities", I try to make up my mind.<br>
Yeah this takes some effort and time. So for most things I don't do it. I have not got strong opinion either way. If someone asks me, I say IDK "I don't know". To tell you the truth—that's a bit liberating, as if not carrying weight on the shoulders, to not have to worry that much, about most things.<br>
But for few things I take interest in, maybe out of fancy, or because they impact my life and I'm forced to make some decision, I try do as described. hth<br>

Fwiw I think there are constraints, the number of options is not infinite. But also we have the power to actively chose between the options. Or even engineer an option extra. It's not beyond us humans. So I don't give anyone, not least the academics, a "get out of jail free" card.<br>
Coming back to morality/epistemology. Yes—the academics are as guilty as anyone for mistaking "good or bad", for "true or false". Too many take the easy feeble minded routes "I like therefore good therefore true", "I dislike therefore bad therefore false". In that they are like most people though. For we are usually worse than morals->truths. We take another shortcut, we go beauty->morals->truths! 😱 So aesthetics driving morality driving epistemology.<br>
Having spent time in academia as postgrad (and having academics in family), my opinion of academia is probably less than the average. I found writing papers boring, few people inspiring but most not. Young students were great—bright sparks there. For me writing code was interesting, getting things to run and do stuff worth my effort. So spent my time in industrial R&D. (also—better pay, important when relocating countries/starting new life, more meritocratic b/c easier to establish merit)<br>
Given that academic research is supposed to free people from commercial market pressures (research funding is decided more like central planning), so they have more time to think more, be more free thinking, it's doubly disappointing how few do anything of the sort. How few live what one might call  "examined lives".<br>
Anyways. Coming back to again to morals/epistemology. Not long ago stumbled online on the idea that wilful ignorance to the point of stupidity is a moral failing, a case of bad morals, not a case of low IQ, or lacking rational thought.<br>
I saw that argument put forward in a YT video on stupidity - Bonhoeffer‘s "Theory of Stupidity" 1) stupidity is low morals not low IQ; and 2) it's social, a mind virus in humans groups more than individuals. (extending Cippola's "stupid is one causing harm to others while not deriving any gain, even taking a small personal loss"; links here https://x.com/ljupc0/status/1895824224029184268). And the more I noticed, the more convinced I become that it's more true than I thought initially.<br>
(I started if not sceptic, then a bit prejudiced against the claim; seemed mildly counterintuitive b/s click bait; hoped to dismiss it as it seemed bad news on first sight)<br>

Yep - a well worn trick. Having not read the paper, just guessing. Instead of convolution or correlation or similar of x and y in time domain, first Fourier transform x and y into X and Y, then multiply X an Y in Fourier domain, then transform the result back in time domain, by inverse Fourier transform.<br>

I'd assume he did, I 'd assume the OP thinks that's corrupt too. Why wouldn't he?? An average reasonable personal would.<br>
I am not USian, live on the other side of the world, follow not US politics. Yet years ago when it was in the local news that "no good, without qualifications, son of a president, earns millions for not doing much in a far away country" thought - well that smells of corruption of some sort.<br>
But by the same token, ask yourself now: why did *you* think the OP thought Biden son was not corruption? Why did you think so? Did you think so, because you value your side more, than whether something is true or false? You won't be the first to be using like/dislike as a way of deciding on whether something is true/false tbh. Most people use their feelings to decide on truthfulness.<br>

Yep it makes sense.<br>
To me "AI will enslave us" moral panic looked the usual moral panic BS too start with. Something we humans do with every new tech.<br>
Then I thought "we are anthropomorphizing this again". (prior examples of us doing similar https://x.com/ljupc0/status/1877086487038316725) Enslaving a weaker species is what we humans elect to do. So we assume by automatism that every other species would do the same.<br>
But now @SchmidhuberAI makes an excellent point: the energy and matter needed to further an Intelligence on a cosmic scale, is found outside of our biosphere. So that's where AI will go to expand.<br>

I found being aggressive even preemptive in shaping the feed pays dividends.<br>
Remember - Block-ing is now one-way block only. It simply means your account becomes read-only to the blocked. While it also does inform the algorithm. Much closer to Mute. I used "Show me less of/this" too, but that became a chore quickly, as is multiple taps.<br>
True the Algofeed seems very aggressive in that interaction with subject Y brings in a flood of Y-related into the feed. I maintain thematic accounts Lists, (and especially fit well Xpro Decks) and they do work to remedy the above problem. They are like thematic extra "For you" personalised feeds.<br>
Yeah the revealed morals of Musk/oids are a disappointment. But hardly new or surprising, right? Their stupid antics are kept mostly out of my feeds at low level acceptable with the above. (and thanks to them, researching on stupidity lead me to learning "stupidity is not low IQ, but is low morals, being imoral" etc-very useful knowledge! every cloud silver lining etc)<br>
Having said that-no reason to not have accounts everywhere and replicate your social graph Following-Followers everywhere really. It's the social graph ands not the posts history that keeps us in the walled garden. The “public square N² iron law of network value” is not going anywhere. It's the price we pay to have a semblance of single public square.<br>

IDK much physics and am physics' nobody, so persuading me will not bring you closer to your aim.<br>
You need to persuade other physicists. I imagine physicists doing research outside academia maybe more receptive to new ideas then ones inside.<br>
Science is a social activity. It's practices by groups, not mere single person. Getting something right that others get wrong is a first step only. Necessary but not sufficient. Everyone has their own idea how they are to use their time they got allocated here and now. They will not give you their time willy-nilly. We all have other things we want to do.<br>
Still I think 1) making a forecast about the future; or 2) achieving some feat, currently impossible, is the best way to make people give you some of their time.<br>

Ronald Regan was an actor too. That's didn't disqualify him from bring a president. Trump was a TV personality (among other things) too with his own show.<br>
IDK about Ukraine - never been there, don't speaking the language. Police beat someone? Yeah I imagine policeman use force on someone every day in every country.<br>
"old Orthodox Priest" - No idea what that is, sorry. I am a (lapsed) Orthodox Christian, have been in orthodox churches, at ceremonies etc.  There are many orthodox churches, they are distributed decentralised. They are not like Vatican and Catholicism, one single thing.<br>

Is this a physics model?<br>
If it is, then afaik you can make a forecast of something that will happen, that will be observed in the future. Then your model needs to be correct about the observation. While the currently used models get it wrong.<br>
Then someone will take notice. Typically some younger upstart.<br>
Or maybe you make a machine that achieves some feat, currently impossible. Physics related - seems to me while humanity has made inroads with electricity, magnetism, nuclear - seems little progress on gravity?? We are almost as shackled to Earth as Cromagnons were. Say you make a device to lift loads off the earth, and into space, say 10 times more efficient than now - I imagine people will take notice.<br>
Is this along the lines of what you have in mind?<br>

You are being stupid, but stupidity is not mere low IQ or being bad at reasoning. No—stupidity is a moral failing. It's the case of bad morals. Thinking that something is good when it's bad, and the other way around. Links with YT videos<br>

Money for what? Donated what? It's not his war. Russia is trying to conquer them, subjugate them. It's attacking their cities daily, killing them where it can. They are defending their lives, their country. If they lay down their arms, they will be killed. That's why they are fighting and not surrendering. If it was him fighting a war without support of the other 40M people, there would have been no war. As he would have been removed on day one.<br>

I dislike his AI doomerism too.<br>
However—imo saying it's *all* fear-mongering is too strong a claim. Yes—there is more fear-mongering that I'd ideally want to see. But there is more than that.<br>
There is part that is not fear-mongering. For example analysing information flows in humans' information networks. (in Nexus) I like him analysing human organisations and how information flows. Reading it placed in historic context is interesting too. Many CompSci people do the same for machines. But not so much for humans. And with humans, mostly concern themselves in the context of Social Media.<br>
Having said that: I can't understand how anyone can write a whole book on the topic of information, and forego the opportunity to tell millions of readers: "you think information is something strange, or amorphous, or not well defined, but we actually have a very good handle of Information. This is how it's defined. (...I flip a coin, hide the result; now I know and you don't; next I tell you the result; there—I just gave you 1 bit of information...)." And tie that in with probability, and with Shannon entropy, and with "how much information do we gain when observing one symbol." But hey—probably I'm wrong thinking this. For only one among us is a best selling author. 😇<br>

You are forecasting a future your detractors wish for. You maybe right, or you maybe wrong.<br>
However, we have the recent past, where UK followed on the policies you advocate for. This past is not in doubt. The results are in, and they are uniformly bad. UK contribution to global-anything is minuscule, the effect insignificant. At the same time, the country is croaking under the weight of those policies. Your policies already made UK weaker and poorer than it needed to be.<br>
I wish we could go in time, and undo the damage your policies had done. But that's not possible. So the 2nd best thing, one possible, is to stop listening to anything you say, and bid you and your policies good bye.<br>

I hear you, but don't you think "maintain an epistemology that is independent from their morality" is too much of an ask? We'd need super-humans, angels for that. Is that even possible for everything?<br>
Isn't more achievable "be aware that my epistemology is influenced by my morals, be vigilant, test what you can, in preference to assuming"? I mean sometimes it's easy. I can see with my own eyes if the sun is shinning right now or not. But for anything non trivial it quickly becomes a question of trust.<br>
With natural sciences we have got independent from us feedback to guide us. We are lucky that way. Everyone else is more at sea than us.<br>

Is anything wrong with pushing Putin to stop attacking Ukraine? All I read from you and Moscow Musk are calls for Ukraine to stop defending and lay down arms. Well—they can't do that, for Russia will simply murder them.<br>
Have you or Musk ever called on Putin to stop attacking Ukraine, stop murdering Ukrainians?<br>
There used to be a sliver of people called the "useful idiots" until 1990 in the West. They were called "govnojeds" in the East by their appreciators. In the online age I have seen "nutnik" = a vatnik, that is nuts too. You shouldn't aspire to be a nutnik Lex.<br>

I wish you were right. But I fear you'll be shown wrong by future events.<br>
IDK for sure ofc, as I haven't got any special or non-public knowledge. I'm not in the US nor from the US. I'm observing as if a light from a distant galaxy. Given this is online chatter, a little tittle-tattle is not beyond me too. ;-)<br>
Having said that—I do have a viewpoint. As this, and the outcome of the whole thing, affects me too.<br>
IMO Musk is exactly 180 degrees wrong thinking "if we don't give Russia what it wants, then WW3". I think it is that if US+Europe *do* give Russia what it wants, then we *do* get WW3.<br>
The perceived "wrongness of Musk" on our part, to the point of outright stupidity is explainable. Stupidity is not a low IQ or lack of reasoning. No—stupidity is a moral failing. Lack of morals. Or rather—set of morals contrary to our morals set.<br>
What's the set of morals that Musk subscribes to, that's at odds with the moral set we subscribe to? I speculate that it's a case of "master morality". Putin's strength is virtuous, war is admirable, power is proof of righteousness. In a fight, back the stronger side. (might is right.) This is like the pre-Christian European morality—like that of Rome. That's why we observe Musk-ians playing with Roman salutes.<br>
Whereas the morality most of us subscribe to, is "slave morality". Slave morality is the idea that to suffer is virtuous. Christ suffered for us, suffering is noble. Conversely inflicting suffering is evil. This is the moral framework of Christianity.<br>

On a digital computer agreed—no I can't search. But then the computer is not continuous so that's expected.<br>
On an analog computer, say it's setup so it computes a minimum of a function, simply using the laws of physics as they do. And ends up in that minima state, therefore computing it for me.<br>
Wouldn't you say that it just searched through a continuous space? Or maybe you'd say: ah but it uses atoms and particles and stuff, they are not continuous either, they are discrete too, so the analog computer is not searching continuous space either.<br>

Right on and already under way but for writing, in the medium of text, not voice and speaking.<br>
Few nuances though.<br>
It will thin out replace the middle.<br>
On the top end meaningful relationships with close people family friends will remain. Even strengthen - if "love is all you need" improves the human condition and us human HI get it from robots AI. Good.<br>
On the bottom end talking to competent AI sales rep booking a holiday is superior experience compared to talking to a boring uninterested uninteresting HI rep trying to max his commission providing near zero value to me borderline cheating. That's not good for his soul. Good AI is replacing that.<br>
It's looking like that kind of HI human character development through AI supplementation maybe as beneficial to humans as any AI scientist R&D. And mass adoption may come sooner than singularity.<br>

That kind of stupidity comes from a moral failing. Not low IQ, but bad morals.<br>
In Bonhoeffer‘s "Theory of Stupidity" 1) stupidity is low morals not low IQ; and 2) it's social, a mind virus in humans groups more than individuals. Extending Cippola's "stupid is one causing harm to others while not driving any gain even at a small loss".<br>

True that. Is searching NP-hard in discrete spaces only? Is it that way because discrete space lacks continuity so we got no differentilibilty to guide our search? Ee have to blindly try one after the other without curvature as a guide?<br>
And does quantum compute - if and when it ever works out - offer potentially a way out of that predicament? In general not search specific. General opportunity to if not catch up with the curse of dimensionality, then at least not be left behind eating dust?<br>

They're doing it of their own volition. All Russia needs to do is to supplying minimal cover. Say in my psyop I lie mercilessly in industrial quantities.

There is not certainty in anything. If US dropped a few, Mao might have changed his mind. Or people around Mao.<br>
Ofc the small states can just build more—so it's not 100M, but 1000M. For the alternative for the weaker side is to lie down and die.<br>
IDK why country as big as Russia (larges land mass in the world), or China (got good chunk of Asia) need extra land. So they go to great lengths to acquire more.<br>
But whatever is driving them is irrelevant as far as small guys are involved. If you are an ant, and an elephant is about to squash you—inflicting pain on him to remind him it's going to hurt, is your only option.<br>

I have nothing against that—but I have nothing specific to add tbh. IDK any details.<br>
I'm cognisant with the general Soviet and now Russia mode of operation though. In broad strokes, Surkov etc ideas: negation of any possibility for objective truth. Merciless lying in industrial quantities—even when near term there's no need for it—to destroy any possibility to any truth. Flooding us in random lies does indeed work. Drowns us in noise and exhaust our information processing capacity. It does kill the idea of one definite truth existing.<br>
Gets re-discovered from time to time, e.g. Bannon's "flood the field with shit". Trump gets it instinctively deploys it with charm (!!—yeah IK, but think it true), unlike Bannon. (who grosses out every living creature around)<br>
Note the contrast: US didn't deny they're going to invade Iraq, they were trying to manufacture reasons for. While Russia denied they are going to invade Ukraine (even while invading it). Similarly previously they denied they took Crimea - the "green man".<br>

Musk’s master morality in action is like fire: a good servant, but a bad master.<br>
At this point, he’s like the most dangerous kind of Bismarckian general—stupid and energetic.<br>
And of course, it’s Putin, not Zelensky, who can stop the train. If Ukraine gives up, the train doesn’t stop—it just runs over the Ukrainians still standing on the tracks. That’s why they keep fighting. For them, the alternative isn’t peace—it’s death.<br>

Detterence. It's in the name - "nuclear DETERRENCE". It's for the weaker side, the one that's defending, the one that's being attacked, to detter the aggressor , the one attacking, usually the bigger stronger side. To make them think twice, and hopefully not attack, not invade.<br>
No one is talking about winning any nuclear wars. MAD means - either peace, or we both die. It doesn't mean - I win you lose. The option of one side winning and living, while killing the loosing side, is taken off the table. That's the idea. To equalise the playing field. Either we both live in peace, or we both die.<br>

The making up of stuff, the level of stupidity that puzzles you—it's not an intelligence failing, not a question of mere IQ or reasoning or some such. No—that kind of stupidity is moral failing. It's bad morals.<br>
Or rather "bad morals" from the PoV of the "slave morality" most of us subscribe to. Our morality is "slave morality" because we take it for granted that to suffer is virtuous, one should turn the other cheek, and so on. And to inflict suffering is evil.<br>
Trump-ians subscribe to "master morality". They see strength as virtuous, Putin/Russia war of aggression admirable, the power proof of righteousness. In a fight, they back the stronger side. (Might is right.) This is like the pre-Christian European morality, like that of Rome. It’s why Musk-ians are playing with Roman salutes: they, too, are proponents of this master morality.<br>

Interesting. Although ngl, would expect of all areas where humans and non-human animals are measured how much similar-differ, the distance humans-animals in the organisation of sex and reproduction to be but as large as brain functions. I'd expect humans to have very unique setup relative to other animals. Almost as unique as their brains.<br>
Fyi there exists an obscure '90s book "The Erect Woman" (original "The Planet of Women") arguing that sexuality, and in particular women's control of sexual attraction, and almost complete control of mating, (unlike many other species) is a key factor in human evolution. That sexual dynamics between the male and female halves of the species, facilitating cooperation between the halves forming long term partnership, jump started by sexual attraction (so not talking about intra-sex competition), is more influential than labor, tools, opposing thumbs, brain size, fire etc. The theory advocated is that sexuality created the human species. (in addition to sex creating every one individual.)<br>
(Possible that the author has joined the ranks of the cranks since. Unfortunate - but doesn't make his then arguments nil. In fact - the argument advanced in the book makes more sense than the competing hypothesis imo.)<br>

I came to think the personal animus Musk feels towards Zel, expressed every hour of every day by promoting and boosting even the most stupid of fake news, no exception, is the rage, one with "master morality", feels towards the a weak person, a person without power, that refuses to lie down, accept his fate, and die.<br>
It only looks to most of us as stupidity. It's not stupidity as commonly understood. It's not lack of brains or thinking. No, it's stupidity as moral failing.<br>
Or rather "moral failing" viewed from the PoV of our position, the ~80% of us, that subscribe to "slave morality". Most of us are Christians of various shades. Christ suffered for us, so suffering is noble. Inflicting suffering, conversely, is evil. This is the moral framework of Christianity. Slave morality is the idea that to suffer is virtuous.<br>
The other ~20% favour "master morality". They see Putin/Russia strength as virtuous, the war of aggression admirable, the power proof of righteousness. In a fight, they back the stronger side. (Might is right.) This is like the pre-Christian European morality, like that of Rome. It’s why Musk-ians are playing with Roman salutes: they, too, are proponents of this master morality.<br>

Afaik no—they are not asking for soldiers, only for weapons. Although if someone from Europe or US offered, doubt they'd refuse. But no one is offering, that's not on the table.<br>

TBH the words "pariah state" sound to me like belonging to a different age. One we are leaving behind.<br>
NK was pariah even before the nukes. Others like China, India, Pakistan—got them, and are not pariah atm. Once the US umbrella no longer protects Germany, while Russia showing daily "On Berlin" slogans on prime TV, doubt many will begrudge Germans nukes.<br>
ABM—yes a worry, but 1) far from perfect; 2) the doubt the aggressor has "will my ABM hold" maybe enough for MAD deterrence to prevent an invasion; 3) the concrete case of Russia-Baltics-Poland-Nordics I'm not an expert but aren't St Pet. and Moscow maybe close enough that rockets don't need to go up in space and down??

You are wrong. Russia can't win the current war.<br>
Ukrainians decided they are to live, and live free, or die. As long as theirs is "give me freedom or give me death" Russia can't win in this conventional war. They are not making enough conventional weapons, nor mobilising large enough army.<br>
The only way they win is a nuclear war against Ukraine. Or give up and stop attacking. That's a draw. For Russia doesn't lose much in that case either. (hence waging a war of choice)<br>

Yes! What you are observing is that stupidity is a moral failing. Not intellectual failing, not low IQ or any such stuff—no, stupidity is a moral failing. A personal fail when it comes to morals.<br>
It's so rare an opportunity, relative to the importance of the topic, that I take the liberty to post two under-watched videos on the topic.<br>
Bonhoeffer‘s "Theory of Stupidity" makes a second good point (to the "it's a moral failing not IQ")—it's a social phenomenon, it goes in groups, almost like an infectious disease (a "mind virus" even!)<br>

I was a young person in 1990-s though. I lived through interesting times. (collapse of the state ideology, collapse of the country, civil wars, starting up an upstart/startup ctry) The Kremlin/Russia state, its world view, the mode of operation (e.g. using minorities in neighbouring countries)—that all looks familiar to me, I understand it. Also I know how malleable historical memories are. Quite a lot of randomness is erased, made into a cause-consequence story, whereas my recollection is—there was none.<br>
Can't but note the "eastward expansion promise" reference. This has been explained so many times, the context, the meaning, all available online. I just searched saw an overview<br>

Yes—if Ukraine keeps a strong army.<br>
No—if it accepts the demands of Putin to reduce the army.<br>
This is what the quarrelling is about. I don't watch MSM b/c there is so much noise, that the actual reason for the spat is obscured.<br>
Afaik Trump demands that Ukraine reduce their army. This is what Putin demands as a price to stop attacking. (the war stops when Russia stops attacking) Ukraine doesn't want to do that. If they do it, what's to stop Russia invading them again. This time they will take Kyev and subjugate Ukraine. This is the Chechnya scenario. I too see that this is the Russian interest as currently articulated by Putin/Kremlin. That is still the aim of the invasion: to rule over Ukraine. They are not giving up on that. Why would they? Looks to me things are developing to their advantage.<br>
Yes indeed this is brought up because Europe. Europe is indeed somewhat special when it comes to War & Peace. Europe started not 1, but 2—2!!—World Wars! Not Ordinary Wars, but World Wars. Every other continent has not managed even a single World War, before *and* since. It's a bit of an over-achievement that. That bears on people's minds when making decisions. Correct.<br>

Yes, I too think the war will drag on for as long as Russia attacks. (ofc Putin could give the order today, the war will stop; but imo that will not happen; for P has own reasoning too)<br>
The other options is for Ukraine to lay down arms. But that for them is to stop existing, and not only as a state Ukraine, but as ethnicity Ukrainians too. They may chose to—and the option is open every day—but I don't see any signs. The basic rule for anything alive/like—people, state, nation—is that their self-preservation, choosing life over death, is almost their definition.<br>
TBF I don't see how Putin will agree to stop attacking where he does not conquer Ukraine. The moment the war stops, Putin is in maximal danger. This is the reason he serially wages war in the first place. Waring increase his power, his control over Russia, empowers him relative to any contenders to the Russian throne. Allows him to stay both in power. (and alive probably!)<br>
As far as I understand looking from afar. The bone of contention is disarming of Ukraine, reducing their current army. Putin requests that. Ukraine (rightly, imo) calculates that the moment they disarm, Putin will just invade them again. And succeed the 2nd time. (like Chechnya)<br>
I see Trump doing the easy route. He just accepts everything Putin demands, and commands on Ukrainians to deliver that. That way the war indeed stops. However, also Ukraine and Ukrainians stop existing. I see how that is not going to happen easily.<br>
Vance and the Tech Bro Progressive Right (TBPR) wing of the coalition I see them as new, West Coast Elite. They are less invested in Europe than the old, East Coast Elite.  Naturally, their gaze is trained over the Pacific, towards Asia. Equally naturally, I the East Coast Elite is feeling more of an descendent of the WEurope civilisation, and looks more across the Atlantic.<br>
In practical terms, I think the difference Re: Europe between them is this. Say now that Germany lacks an army, Russia invades Germany and are fighting to take Berlin. West Coast Elite would be - "well tough sh*t Germany, but you decided to have no army, we are not going to defend you, when you decline to defend yourself". While the East Coast Elite would still send American army over to fight and die. (even if Germany itself decided on a death-by-suicide.)<br>

Because Russia expands by conquering territory and then ruling it centrally from Moscow. That’s their historical mode of operation: add new land to the existing land you control. Do this enough times, and you become the largest country by landmass in the world.<br>
I’m not saying it’s good or bad—it’s simply their pattern of existance, continuing expansion. My own country was created in the process of one of these expansions, when the Russian Empire pushed out its then rival, the Ottoman Empire.<br>
In Europe, there used to be three major empires: the Russian Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and the Austro-Hungarian Empire (ruled by the Habsburgs). Alongside them are the nation-states like France—the oldest of the modern ones—and later younger ones like Germany and Italy.<br>
There’s an interesting compare and contrast between continental empires (like Russia) and maritime empires (like Britain, the Netherlands, and today, the USA). A good podcast on this was on Dwarkesh—an american military historian explained the different logics behind how these empires formed, expanded, and ruled.<br>

Yeah that is true. But it's also true that in a fit of rage and madness, Putin may decide to end the current Earth civilisation(s) and murder us  (and themselves) all. They have the means. So the risk is ever present.<br>
A reason I can think of for Russia to press for Ukraine in a way they didn't press for Afghanistan or any number of countries in Eastern Europe, is if they are convinced that conquering Ukraine is existential for Russia. Like if they don't do that—someone somehow is going to invade Moscow.<br>
But I don't see how that can happen, with or without Ukraine. In a way that it happened in the past. Like Macron orders the French army to march on Moscow? Then Russia will simply drop nukes on them. (and on Paris.) What other means is there for someone to threaten them. That's what I don't understand.<br>

I am not talking about an ordinary risk, where I am maybe attacked in a war over some distant province etc. Talking about the case where my mere existing, is perceived my myself much bigger neighbour(s) as an act off enmity. And the neighbour wants to extinguish me as entity entirely.<br>

NK—was under sanctions afaik forever. Looked like US may invade them at some point. Then they managed to get the bomb. I don't think anyone on the US side talks about invasions any more.<br>
Iran—lacks a nuke. So don't really know how to use them in an argument either side. In the past it looked like US may invade them. But then with all the other wars, seems US backed off for time being.<br>
Expensive—yes they are. But if Israel much much smaller and poorer then now, and also than all other other countries listed above could, then presumably it's not impossibly expensive. (same with North Korea—it is small-to-mid-sized by population, but very poor) Being invaded and ceasing to exist is the most expensive, the ultimate price, from the PoV of a State.<br>

I'm mystified why don't small countries like Taiwan, the Baltics, Poland, the Nordics etc, that under existential threats from much much bigger neighbours, why don't they build nuclear weapons as deterrent? Isreal and North Korea did it—much smaller and or poorer. (South Africa too?)<br>
When faced with threat 1) existential; and 2) by hopelessly bigger adversary. These weapons are the great equaliser, from losing side, the small country moves into a MAD position, levels the filed again. As far as specifically existential threat from outright invasion is concerned. Not all threats. Just that one. But that's plenty.<br>
I presume I'm missing something, as no one is doing it. (except—Israel, North Korea)<br>

Please do. You need ongoing steady stream of data. You are painfully aware of the “one public square N² iron law of network value”. You will face 1:100 odds. Here is a plan.<br>
Enlist us users on your side. Bridge the content X—OpenSocial, or even better Any—OpenSocial, by having OpenSocial App "shadow" X and any other network. Every time I user post on X (and Bsky, Threads...), it's auto-posted on OpenSocial too.<br>
Individual users can't be blocked by X easily. Even if X retaliates and forces me to choose under threat of locking me out of X, expect half X users will chose OpenSocial over X. So it's a win-win for OpenSocial.<br>
ChatGPT App will help me re-create my social graph at OpenSocial. The ownership of the Follows-Followers Social Graph is what keeps us users in the walled garden. Replicate it—and you are golden. Instead of walled garden, make it OpenGarden. (there is your name!)<br>
Then you stand a chance.<br>

Maybe the conditional p.d.f. p(w(n+1) | w(n), w(n-1), … w(1)) has now been learned sufficiently well on a corpora encompassing everything ever written by humans. There is no more juice left in learning this particular layer to higher fidelity. No amount of additional training will conjure a Dirac Delta distribution where none exists.<br>
People will shift their focus up in the stack:<br>
 - Test-time improvements—better inference strategies.<br>
 - Dynamic adaptation—fine-tuning on the fly.<br>
 - Teams of agents—cooperation, competition, specialisation.<br>

Ah—so it's effectively a road tax of some sort. Tax that only people that drive a car pay. Yeah tax should not count towards the GDP I think.<br>
Otherwise, in general, if the seller of the service is the Gov (not the Private sector), so both the buyer and the seller are the Gov, the value will be hard to determine, the price can be arbitrary.<br>
Easiest workaround I see there to get a handle on the value provided, is to privatise it, make it done by the Private sector. Offer it on auction, tender it. Then the Private sector will bid for the contract, so a price will form. Then we  will learn of the value of the service provided.<br>

That will create a distortion of a different kind. Would imply that the value of the transaction is zero both on the Gov side, and the Private individual side that is selling the goods and services to the Gov. That would be the case only if Gov confiscated the provisions effectively, rendering the price moot.<br>
More accurate would be to count every $1 gov spend as 1/2. Say you assume the value on the Gov side is 0, that Gov is totally wasteful. Still the Private person on the other side to the Gov in that transaction, selling their goods and services to the Gov, does so voluntarily. We trust the Private side is doing the transaction of their own volition, b/c it's a good transaction for him. (better than all the alternatives available to them)<br>
Even more accurate would be assume that Gov spend value is 1/2 of the 1/2. For every transaction on the Gov side, given it's not voluntary, you have to allow that it maybe wasteful, or may not be. Fair to assume half-half chance knowing nothing else.<br>
Ergo, multiply every $1 of Gov spend by 0.75 when adding it to the GDP. ;-)<br>

Europeans have had two World wars. Not one, but two. No other continent has managed even one world war! Before nor since.<br>
They has been killing each other on an industrial scale for a time even before, but WW2 topped it all. There are hotspots with potential to ignite WW3 toda too. The idea was better keep them in, than out.<br>
Russia is no greater power than France, or Germany if it decides to be. No one is attacking Russia. The idea that Russia fears Germany or France today, while having enough nukes to wipe their cities 10 times over, is for the birds.<br>
I like reading counterfactuals as anyone. But your central thesis about Russia lacks solid logic.<br>

Yeah, and alternative measures GDP correlate at 0.9 so IDK what's detractors' argument.<br>
More meaningful per capita. That's published anyway. Just not headline reported. 50% of us can hold max 1 thought in our heads. Media honour that incentive.<br>

Accepted! 😇 No worries. 😆<br>
I'm not saying it's researchers doing anything nefarious! I'm/was one of them too. They are supplying what there is demand for—more power to them. It was supposed to be a jokey-jibe on my part, sorry it came across badly. 😊<br>
The algofeed forecast me well, and supplied me with a stream of "consciousness interests". This one<br>
<p><br>
<a href="https://x.com/ljupc0/status/1894564107019288736">https://x.com/ljupc0/status/1894564107019288736</a><br>
...just prior. And with a recent (partly consciousness) ToE cast (this one https://youtube.com/watch?v=3fkg0uTA3qU) still fresh in my memory. So I snapped where I should have had more patience. Sorry about that.<br>
To me Joscha's argument make a lot of sense. That consciousness is—<br>
1) a lower level process, below learning we know and love,<br>
2) something babies are born with,<br>
3) such that it bootstraps itself, and then starts the rest of the learning process; we see<br>
4) humans with a fault in that circuitry never manage to learn.<br>
5) Likewise zombies in movies can't learn anything new—only stay with whatever level of knowing they had at the moment they were zombified.<br>
And to me that looks very much like that Lisp interpreter written in Lisp. I always have had soft spot for Lisp even if I never programmed in it. (only ever read some; Forth too) To have the code and the data the same structure—I feel why Lisp programmers get tad like touched by higher force.<br>
I grew up in 6502 where one is easily led to writing self-modifying code. (for most things non-trivial) I suspect maybe not-unlike Joscha. I allow it that I'm partial to this, less rigorous than one is to be. And for fun and fancy speculating with things that are to be taken with more seriousness.<br>
Thanks for coming back and hope no hard feelings. ☺️<br>

Yeah. Vast numbers of people vastly overestimate how much their words or images influence other people's lives. Artists especially - and I like the bunch in general and am sympathetic to - are by the nature of their vocation esp prone to. Yes dears you are unique and special - but so is everyone else.<br>
We are finding out that the number of writers is vast too! We scribble 1B posts every single day here, for free, of our own volition, without being asked to, becase we want to. For the joy of it. It's eyeballs that are lacking, supply outstripping demand.<br>
Revealed preferences show in black and white how much we are prepared to pay for words and images. And it's not that much! So "free" Internet is paid for by advertisers.<br>
Artists would be well advised to maybe acquint themselves with the ideas of Richard Stalman and the Free Software Foundation. For we are living more and more in the worlds they imagined.<br>
The computer revolution first, the Internet revolution next, now the AI revolution, happened were mostly done by mildly autistic and mostly altruistic nerds. Normies are too selfish, too self-entitled to create something for all, for free, for the love of the creation, and nothing else. Zero other compensation but the glory of creation.<br>
Fwiw I have come to think that the current AI, and the future hoped for ASI creation, is teaching us that compute transforming data→information→knowledge→intelligence→agency→... is all there is to it! AI path opened to AGI now and ASI latter where previously we didn't see any. Seems a foolish deal to me to frustrate, slow down, or even forego 2050s Intelligence Revolution that may times by x10-20x times total human wealth value the way the Industrial Revolution did in 1800s. So that we provide UBI to Disney shareholders?? Every one of us is richer, better off than any king of old!<br>

Don't attribute to malice what can be adequately explained by stupidity. Conspiracies exist. But they require non-zero planning and significant coordination. That are more than most of us can muster.<br>
Oft it starts with inexplicable act of stupidity. So stupid, that looking back, it's hard to imagine it was not planned. "Who does such a thing? It can't be a coincidence!" (narrator: yes it can be)<br>
Stupidity is a moral failing. Not mere irrationality or low IQ etc. It is hard for not-stupid to predict how the stupid acts. It doesn't make sense. Most of the time the stupid act leads to obv bad outcome. No one repeats it. All good.<br>
Once in a blue moon, the stupid act confers some unexpected advantage to the doer. Usually not $$. (at least not initially) Maybe personal satisfaction. (increased social standing to come latter.) They get lucky against the odds. Many notice but don't join in. The act maybe somewhat immoral, if not illegal.<br>
Few unscrupulous persons do join though. Even if some privately suspect their doing is stupid. But most that join are true believers. (you are more successful in the scam if you are not faking it.) They mimetically copy, repeat their actions, reinforcing each other. More see that things are working out for the stoopid, join in. The lunatic group becomes stronger.<br>
Most of the rest don't have a dog in whatever activity the crazies are engaged. The fire will not be immediately extinguished. From outside looks like the group action is pre planned. But it's just next person doing the same what I am doing. That's it. No planning at all.<br>

Yes, possible. I'm sure it crossed his mind, and more than that.<br>
I suspect he needs Belarus united with Russia firmly under his control for that. For that he needs for Lukashenka to die, and for Putin to manoeuver a replacement in position that will be absolutely loyal to him. (lacking local power base) And merge Belarus with Russia. (or at minimum—abolish the local Parliament, however enfeebled atm it may be)<br>

I'm thinking of them generating a 2D output by default (with diffusion), instead of default 1D (with autoregression). Even if I understand both can be made either way. 😆 Still kind of expect that their output can grow much faster with the size of the model than an autoregressive one.<br>
Given the entire output is worked on all at once, and in iterations (reminds me of progressive picture download), one think I'm looking forward to find out is whether the jokes writing performance will improve. People often remark how poorly current LLM-s do at creating jokes. CoT was maybe going to change that—but didn't.<br>

Her prominent presence in media and public life is indictment of the UK culture tbh.<br>
Narcissistic, self serving, not intellectually interesting, nor interested. Zero original thought at all times. Hence—attachment not only to an Idea-ism, but to a Person-ism! Suspect personal ego/ism never allowed a move-on from her "Marx mind blown" moment. (IDK enough to suspect using public sphere for private therapy)<br>
Gee Ash—your first discovery was your last. How very novel. Not at all like the half of the UK population, that can only ever hold a single idea in their head. And for half of that—the same idea all their lives. Ash included in that quarter. (sadly for us all, that couldn't avoid her had to endure)<br>

Well—"disappointment". They will get what they manage to win. Afaisi liberalism is a lot—DYI. Not be expecting that much from others.<br>
Hard to blame anyone for anything really. Liberals' is a minority position to start with. Few people (10% at most?) are ever of the type "liberty first and foremost" ideologically tbh. For most people—other things take precedence.<br>
But Ukraine not being enslaved to Kremlin again, contrary to all expectation—that's quite a boost, no? Maybe not on the level of the French Revolution, but maybe coming close to the American one, no?<br>

I am speaking for myself dad. 🤣<br>
Put your glasses on, please read trice what I wrote. 😅<br>
I did not write "I want to be American". (although I don't mind; I mostly like most of their culture) I wrote that all cultures around the world have been becoming more like the American culture(s) in the recent past (say since 1945). And are likely to become even more in the future (from now 2025).<br>
And the latest reason for that is that most of the world is on the Internet. Internet is a global network for sharing information. By virtue of mostly inventing and starting the whole Internet (and before that—Personal Computers revolution; and before that—Computers revolution), Americans are over-represented on the Internet.<br>
So most of the Information on the Internet is created by Americans. Naturally, the ideas carried by that information are ideas Americans hold dear, or important to them, or are concerned with in some way. Then all the rest of us, the non-Americans, read that information. The words on screen, upon us reading them, are converted into ideas in our heads. Then those ideas, drive our actions.<br>
That's what I wrote. But apparently—not clearly enough! Sorry about that. But thanks for coming back and making me feel much much younger than I feel otherwise!  😆<br>
Stay well my son. 😅<br>

Most are mostly not liberals at this point TBH. Liberals of old had some fire in their bellies. "Give me Freedom or Give me Death!" is a liberal slogan. ("Sloboda ili Smrt", na naski ;-) )<br>
Can you imagine Europe liberals dying for anything?? I can't. The most their liberalism extends is supporting (selected) others (e..g. Ukraine latest) fighting for their freedom.<br>
Nah—people in Europe thinking of themselves as liberals, are many other things. Fashionistas. Consumers. BoBo-s—Bourgeois Bohemians. Hipsters. (now extinct?? when did it happen) Urbanites. And so on.<br>
FT Ganesh noticed in this one particular instance questioned it (here https://ft.com/content/b82bb503-21bb-4d64-8f72-6c6801f3b196), and few (TGA?) had minor Qs asked, but that's about it. That's the extent of introspection. Very little. Zero answers too.<br>
And ofc no action. TBH "Fire in the belly" is not something that can be summoned that rationally. For that one needs to have some base belief, like "freedom is top#1 / everything else less important." (for a liberal) Don't think we'll see revival of that in WEurope. CEEurope liberals still got some road left. Still people valuing liberty, freedom first and foremost, above everything else. (current champions—Ukrainians) If one is tad cynical: in the long cycles, people value most that, what they lack the most.<br>

IDK have no brand loyalties myself.<br>
Have soft spot for Asus EeePC 701! A 7" wonder for 230 pounds in the UK. That little thing saved my life. :-) Kept me sane while commuting for 2.5h by train DtoD daily every day for couple of years. Think at that time closest to it was some Sony tiny laptop at x10 times the price and Windows no Linux.<br>
Latter I got some other Asus laptop, with cr*p battery and not so great screen, and shockingly bad touchpad. That was Linux buggy too—but could be bandaid with some .ko driver or some such.<br>
Since I've moved to 2nd hand Thinkpads (480s) and Macbooks for their RAM sizes. Only min 96GB RAM for me from now on—yay! :-) Now Macbook battery screen touchpad indulges me spoils me tbh. Find myself loathing looking at Thinkpads screens.<br>
MacOS instead of Xubuntu tad faff to get used to new env shortcuts etc. But between better h/w RAM GPU/NPU to try local LLM-s and "it's Unix" (if not Linux) and $ brew—not super hard. Can recommend.<br>

Easy. They were not trained to do so. There is never ever in their training data "I Don't Know" examples!<br>
Look at the recent .@karpathy video, where he (magisterially! imo) explains how they work. And illustrates how to tech it to say "I Don't Know". (IDK)<br>
I Don't Know why labs don't have a "I Don't Know" datasets. 😂<br>
The underlying maths, logic, the basic foundations are all there already! In estimating probability density functions (pdfs; which is what all ML models do, and operate on) we always always reserve some probability mass for "unknown", "unseen", etc. In classification there is always a category "None of the above", "etc", "Unknown". And so on.<br>
This should be possible to get it done tbh.<br>
IDK have not any insider info, but: it's not impossible that human preferences lead the designers astray a bit. Like if the Labs have User testing. And if user tests show people hate very much to be told back "IDK". Much more than being told the wrong thing back in fact. Like for weather forecasts: some (intentionally) skew to forecast too much rain, b/c people really really hate that particular error (forecast,real)=(sun,rain).<br>

😂 Една од најсмешните работи, не можам да се навикнам, да не приметам. 😂<br>
Зашто некој друг НЕ направил нешто што јас мислам требало да направи. (разбирам некој ДА направил нешто што ми смета и реагирам; ама што НЕ направил?? па секој од нас НЕМА да направи милијарда работи секој ден)<br>
WTAF??? Како тоа-јас во мислите командувам други луѓе, кои па треба да прават работи, го живеат животот, како јас што мислам (на 2 секунди) за нив?? И сега-ме изненадија, што НЕ направиле.<br>
Некогаш во расположение и при вишок време ги боцкам назад, малку да ги збунам така захухтани (ако не и запењавени): стварно те интересира ЗАШТО? Тоа малку филозофски прашање - ЗАШТО?<br>
Неочекувано ефективно. 😆 Пошто па кај многу од нас Македонците филозофија (и генерално мислење) е малку погрден збор, "ај немој да ми филозофираш". 😂<br>

I personally found them useful.<br>
I learned it in a London company where I worked for 3yrs. Don't think anyone did anything much with them. For me it was useful. The "next week"—for deciding what to work on. The "past week"—at the end of the year to collect when having a yearly report.<br>
So I continued using the same scheme in another company where I worked for 5yrs. We'd have a weekly group meeting, everyone saying few sentences. What they did, what they plan to do. (I work in R&D)<br>

For the record "avail yourself to work without recompense for free"—Is *not* what I advocate. I think creators should be compensated. I think that is important.<br>
I also think other things are important too. Like liberty, freedom, etc. It's never only a single thing we need to worry about. We have to juggle many balls and balance multitude of aims and means.<br>
Throwing people in jail b/c they write words, sing songs, draw pictures—is a bad way to go about those aims. We know better than that, can do better, that State violence there is unwarranted.<br>

Mostly people can hold a single idea in their head. Two completing ideas, at the same time, make them dizzy, uncomfortable, confused, scared, some become aggressive.<br>
The hope I hold for AI-Neurolink-... is to augment the human brain functioning somehow. Like a brain prothesis. Like writing and latter reading allows us to expand our memory.<br>
To help the less fortunate 50% among us that drew short straws in lifes' lotteries. Life is tough for stupid people. Saw a really good documentary once.<br>

Catastrophizing is profitable; Savonarolas have an inherent advantage. We’re evolutionary wired to put 10x more weight on a bad path than on a good one when envisioning the future.<br>
When assessing the joint probability of "(rustling leaves, tiger)", the utility of errors "wrong and skittish" versus "wrong and eaten" is highly asymmetrical.<br>
I wish there was a way, that for every public statement we make, every public post we fire into the ether, that we bet on it. We bet to lose something small, but that we hold dear. Even if sth almost symbolic like $5. Anything >0 value.<br>

No evolutionary advantage to it? The brain busy with more important activity—building itself up? Our parents keep us alive, memory is needed to stay alive, so no need to remember much? Do we start born with many more neurons than we need and use latter?—if so then maybe growing up the brain prunes itself ruthlessly. Maybe related?<br>

"I don't see any reason that shouldn't apply to IP"—the reason is that we value liberty. We want to be free to do as we well the hell please to do. That's the reason. We value liberty. Freedom—good, unfreedom—bad. More of the former, less of the latter, we are to strive for.<br>
"Scion blowing the inheritance on coke, whores and casinos"—not the worst thing in the world. If he wishes to, he should be free to do so. Not as great a loss as you seem to think. The children of the whores and the drug dealers will enrol to US Universities, go to Stanford, then start Unicorns in the Silicon Valley. Sounds good to me. Money well spent.<br>

Let us not imagine what Michelangelo would or would not have done. As these are counterfactuals we create in our heads are too malleable to our own desires. Let us stick to things we are fairly certain happened for real, in the real world, in the past.<br>
More recent—Vang Gogh comes to mind. As famously producing a lot, while earning zero for it. I'm not saying he was happy for that. I am just saying—it's possible, it's not impossible. He did create his art after all, that did happen.<br>
"Industrialising production based on a foundation of IP law."—indeed that was the case. Albeit famously Germany, US, now China, industrialised while enforcing little of non-domestic IP laws. So it is possible that IP laws subtracted, slowed down that, rather than accelerated it.<br>
"Which convention the internet has undone almost completely"—indeed, and how is that going? Is the Internet an impoverished for content place, where nothing is ever created? Boring and soulless? Or are we living through an explosion of creativity and creation unlike one ever seen in human history? I claim it's the latter.<br>
You counter a few things I don't claim. Like "I can't deny human nature". I agree. I don't deny human nature. I don't want to deny human nature. Why would I do that? That would be crazy on my part. I claim—you, imprisoning me, for writing something you find objectionable, is you denying my human nature. And so on.<br>

Yeah, that again is a related, but different discussion. Why do we compensate, what, and how.<br>
Yes I would be annoyed. Is my annoyance a good reason to throw the other guy in prison? IDK—maybe yes, maybe no. Up for discussion. When giving examples. I shy away from dreaming up most edge cases. Extreme cases are not going to be regulated well by any laws we dream up. Laws are for the median cases.<br>
Yes, creators need to be compensated—they deserve to make a living from their work. But this doesn’t extend to their grandchildren. Copyright laws should incentivize creation, not provide luxury for the descendants of the original creator a century later.<br>
AI creation is teaching us that maybe compute transforming data → information → knowledge → intelligence is all there is to it. Hobbling that chain, just so Mickey Mouse earns few more $$$ to Disney shareholders, while delaying the creation of non-human intelligence—that may not be the deal we want to take.<br>

Exactly! The moment warring stops, (Ukraine is not the first war either) Putin is in maximal danger. Imo he has every incentive to be in a war forever. E.g. Milosevic didn't fall while he was warring about. He was ousted the first time there was year-two of peace. (from recollection) IDK how things stand with other dictators deposed in recent times.

But no value is "taken away". At the point of idea conception—zero value exists.<br>
Say I dream up a "Better Mouse Trap". I don't build it myself. I don't sell it myself. I write about it on X.<br>
Has any value been created at this point? No. Value existing is zero. We can estimate the potential value. But—that's a forecast, nothing more. Can be anything from -Inf to +Inf. From the worst disaster, to being priceless. Median zero. Most ideas amount to nothing.<br>
Now you read my post on X. You build "The Better Mouse Trap Company". You produce "Better Mouse Trap" by millions. Value is created now, at this point only. By yourself. How much value? We don't know yet.<br>
You sell each trap for $10. You sell millions of them. Now we learned how much value got produced. It's $10M.<br>
Who created the value? Yourself. Did I help? Yes. Agree it would be good that I should be compensated for my contribution. But to say that I produced the value—is in my mind is untrue. You produced the value.<br>
Incentives. It's a related topic, but a somewhat different one. I dispute your claim that without IP people would not produce. In the past there were times with no IP laws. People still created. E.g. during the Renaissance artists like Michelangelo and Leonardo still produced art.<br>
I have a patent to my name. (now expired) Did I produce the invention in order to get a patent? No. I produced it without ever thinking about a patent. (in fact that part was a chore I mental-note-d "avoid in the future".) I did what I did because I loved doing. I had a problem, and I solved it. It was wonderful. One of the best days of my life tbh. Comparable to getting kids, or solving an up-to-that-point unsolved integral.<br>
The Internet, Linux, GNU—some of the greatest technological achievements—were built by people creating for the love of creation, not patents. So to say it's impossible—does not tally with reality.<br>
IDK why and how "slave-labour" you mention came into your head. No one is forcing anyone to do anything. People do stuff out of their free will. Kept secret, or giveth away, or sold for $$$—they are free to do as they freely choose. Only unfreedom is people locking up other people for the crime of copying words, picture, music etc. That's IP. Punishing people for copying and sharing ideas is effectively a thought crime.<br>

As I have less time left, I value it more.<br>
In my youth, I never thought much about the edge of my future horizon. I knew it was finite, but for every imagined limit, I could just add +1. That effectively made it never ending, infinite.<br>
Now I am cognisant it's not forever. I can see the edge. I now ration somewhat my time. When I spend it in the company of another person, I judge: was it better spent in/with company, than would have been spent alone?<br>
Especially with the Internet, there is usually at the end of every day, something I wanted to do, but I run out of time. (and I'm falling asleep on my feet)<br>
I imagine most people go through a similar proces. It feels natural, and seems logical to me tbh.<br>

You are the 2nd person in this thread like this. I imagine I fell in a time-warp chasm of boomers and or OAPs. (judging by the thread) I don't blame you—I blame the X algo-feed. Not your fault.<br>
In the future—you can Mute or Block accounts that post things you find disagreeable. For they are likely to do it again. This time—I'm doing it for you. blocked<br>

Not talking about this particular person/case, but in general. Now compared to my childhood, I notice. General decline in stoicism. Grown ups engaging in semi-emotional blackmail. (for social brownie points.) Rise of neo-toddlerism-<br>

Using anecdote, personal experience to make decisions affecting many. Effectively giving some cases weight zero, other cases weighted max 100. Heard people say they don't trust statistics. Apparently caring only about their favourite victim while discarding the rest is better??<br>
To me looks like emotionally not entirely grown ups in positions of power deciding things they should not be. Every decision carries in extremis emotional pain. A grown person should be capable of carrying that load. Not transfering to others. (and esp not to children.)<br>

The latter - only if you don't realise value from it yourself. If you do realise value-then it's half-half, half-me half-you realised value. So not nullified but halved to yourself.<br>
Why wouldn't you realise value yourself? Maybe you didn't see it. Maybe most of the value is in the realisation, not in the idea. After all - abstract IP is just abstracts at that point. Zero value has been created yet. Imposing cost to others at that point strikes me similar to taxing unrealised gains.<br>
Maybe better balanced - if I don't want these words copied, I don't broadcast them publicly. I keep them to myself. I take care whom I share them with. It strikes me too much to expect everyone else to police prevent copy of these words, but for I to put zero effort in that.<br>

Your are not wrong there. Tax revenue collection is amongst the last state organs (others being - police, army) to go incompetent and fail. By definition - if the state exists, these guys do function. (to a degree)<br>
NB that's doesn't mean they're not lumbering giants crushing people left and right. They are. Betty would have probably suffered ther same predicament if say it was HMRC  that owed her money and had to pay her. (our of the ordinary established give-or-take for which they have well worn processes running) DWP may have done better as they are setup for giving out money as default. (HMRC is for taking in)<br>
My point is: once Betty is one off, out of established processes, it's very hard to make the machine carefor her. If the machine was a single human or few people - yes one could hope that they care. But the system is not that at all.<br>

As I said—I'm not going to litigate. Looked it up—everything said there about nuclear can be applied to any energy source.<br>
I have roof solar and battery. The self-use is about 40%, and with extra battery may get to 50%. On average, over the year. Extremes are - worst in winter 0%, best in summer 100%.<br>
That understates the challenge. Everything that is consumed must be produced, supply matching demand, not on average over a day or an hour—but every moment every second of every day. I also know my kWh of energy from my MW of power. And am not spooked when I hear "three phases" of electricity. I had a bit of Electrical Engineering training in my youth.<br>
Reading stuff I see many opinionated people who 1) either lack any knowledge, and particularly that there is no magic but must be supply==demand, or "very bad things will happen"; or 2) do not construct physics consistent models of the world.<br>
I have resigned myself that no change will come to the UK, until a nation-wide blackout happens. Of the type when UK has to resort to Dinorwig to bootstrap itself back. With people stranded on trains overnight, dozens in ICU dead with machines cutting off after generators run out of diesel some hours into the blackout.<br>

Ok, I'm not going to litigate that. Just to note for the record. I don't think that nuclear is expensive. I think it's average-to-cheap. And can be made much much cheaper, should be choose to.<br>
On a meta-/epistemic level. When I take a stance on an issue, I force myself to think "what evidence would convince me I'm wrong". It's bit of a chore that. Not pleasant, not something one looks to. On the plus side, on most issues—I lack particular view. That I find somewhat liberating.<br>
I have had help there professionally. Doubly so.<br>
Programmers writing programs have to think "I wrote this, I think it's correct, but I know there is an error". With the added terror: "If I made 1 error, then my thinking process is faulty; if my thinking process is faulty, 1000 errors maybe lurking in these 1000 lines of code".<br>
Traders when placing a bet also typically set up a stop-loss "if I lose X on this, I will accept I was wrong, and liquidate the rest".<br>

Sorry to be rude and interrupt - but that's logicaly inconsistent.<br>
If it were as global as it's said, US would be paying as much for energy as UK. Or UK as much as US. Or both some middle price. The prices would be about equal. That's what global market means.<br>
These are all choices. Few things are inevitable. But for most things - UK gov chooses option 3 over options 1 or 2. The price of energy is one such choice. Other concerns take precedent over the price we pay for UK gov. Claiming lacking agency is self serving. Power without responsibility.<br>

Merkel was not a mere NPC like myself or yourself. She was *the* leader. The one person that sought (and got!) the position to lead. So she bears a lot more responsibility when a decision turns bad. Esp decision where there were reasonable credible forecasts about what may happen.<br>
Nuclear exit and energy in general. Say what you want about someone like Vaclav Smil, but he is not 1) ignorant; or 2) with a poor record.<br>
Remember seeing a video from him >10yrs ago making the argument:<br>
#1 you got 70 GW reliables now;<br>
#2 replace with 70 GW un-reliables + 70 GW gas backup reliable.<br>
How is option #2 not going to be more expensive than #1? It will be more expensive. And—can always cut the un-reliables out of #2, and just use the 70 GW gas all the time.<br>
I got reminded, as the UK predicament is exactly the same at this very moment. UK are now getting consequences (==cost, the bill) of dunderheaded wishful thinking. And I see no thinking process kick in. We are on auto-pilot, led by seemngly innumerate PPE-s. That are only capable of numeracy when their personal bank accounts are in consideration.<br>
I expect more from a PhD in natural sciences tbh. And a lot more character too! She was not some grifting telesales operator selling dodgy "financial products". The UK PPE-s strike me more of the grifting types seen in finance. On them—I'm less surprised.<br>

Always astonishes me how small RoI for the grifter it is when fleecing the public purse. How cheap some random brothers are: cost the public a Billion (with a B), get back a Million (with an M). RoI of 1/1000. (yeah I know, I know it's not grifters' Billion in the denominator, they put zero in, for them 1/0=Infinity)<br>
I guess if people as capable in the art of bezzle as themselves were to f*ck off to the US, they'd earn multiple Millions. The land of opportunity rewards such character richly. If only they were brave and honest to admit to themselves what they are in for (the M $$$), UK wd be free of this particular predicament.<br>

They are libertarians at heart but are innumerate. They want to do "whatever they want to do". ATM they spend most of their time as wage slaves. Spending their waking time earning in order to eat.<br>
It hurts their heads when they start thinking about "hows" of actually realising sth like that they like. So then they just fallback to "freedom for me but not for thee" (at the barrel of the gun that I got and you lack)<br>

😆 I hear you, but by now I've become so X-trained that the process takes couple of seconds and no post writing starts.<br>
I'm "Ah - I know this, it's that way" (about to start typing) but then in my head runs the aftermath ending with "Nah, who cares".  (making an exception for this one as I'm typing this, haha 😂)<br>
I wonder if it'd help if I knew for sure that the OP will see the reply? B/c ofc there is not even that assurance. (or I know not of it)<br>
So in the end—one moves to the next post.<br>

Heh—that would the unsurprising straightforward logic.<br>
US finally pulling it's troops back, and leaving Europe. WW2+Cold war finally over. EU bigger countries (Germany) together with Poland+Baltics+Nordics (that are most in the newly  imperial Russia cross hairs the most), acquiring independent nuclear deterrent.<br>
I suspect it's not quite going to work that way. It never is straightforward. Curve balls random events happen.<br>
Also broader trends. E.g.—mass social media makes for surprisingly unified information then consequently ideas space?? To the point of trans-national polities non-geographical distributed almost form?? Belgium citizens show keen interest in the US president. US voters care about China or Taiwan and whatnot. Surprising. Mind viruses propagate take hold across oceans, mass psychosis come in waves (women with swinging d*cks, CO2 will both burn and drown us, post-ideology, Iraq WMD).<br>

Heh 😆 Maybe use current ones sharpen your reading comprehension? I didn't say "AI is nothing with HI". I wrote "atm HI creates AI, but the opposite is not possible". AI ofc has a lot to do with HI, given current AI we got is the best model of HI. (us)<br>
For singularity I imagine 5-7 miracles need to happen. Or about a million times performance improvement. I think of "miracle" when performance improves by factor x7-x10 times. There is a breakthrough of some kind, something we didn't know how to do and failed trying, suddenly works out, we learn how to do it.<br>
(in the 2000-s when I was in the area, there were about only half-dozen people in the UK that could train an RNN; nowadays transformers—that replaced LSTM, that replaced RNN—are trained by thousands; I gather ~2 miracles occurred)<br>
The current LLMs—chatbots and reasoners we got, are miracles. TBS if the logical reasoning for R&D pans out. I am using them daily for coding, am painfully aware of the shortcomings. As conversationalists they do quite well imo.<br>

Merkel-the-scientist is a cautionary tale that no-one is immune to folly. No-one.<br>
With her growing up in East Germany, there is always tiny residual of suspicion: in an alternative reality counter factual, if Merkel were groomed/sleeper agent—what would she have done different, compared to what she did for real?<br>

The unknown to me is what happens in 2140 when all bitcoins are minded. Will the miners have incentive to mine then?<br>
Atm the fastest (the one that works out the unknown nonce by SHA256 trial-and-error hashing first) gets a new coin. (that's minted out of thin air) So there exists incentive there.<br>
The other incentive for a miner is transaction fees I guess. Other than that—the only other option is appreciation of the existing coins. But that's unstable—may go up as well as down.<br>

...I missed in the previous "conformity on the issue, I'm against the consensus, therefore they wrong, I right". If that meta-method was successful at separating true from false, we would use that meta thinking all the time. There will be no need for evidence, inquiry, deduction, science, all the hard stuff.<br>
We would just do na opinion poll, and where there is >90% consensus, we decide the opposite. Or the same. Whatever. The trouble is: when we have zero information, no amount of consensus presence or absence tells us much about what's true or false.<br>
We are better off, instead of trying for impossible (true information from Kremlin is water from stone), to look elsewhere (e.g. Ukraine in this case) where the information is less tightly controlled.<br>

I have not got better info on this particular matter. Ofc I don't—how can I, I'm also not working in the Kremlin etc.<br>
I do have better info on the Kremlin mode of operation on this matter though. As demonstrated in the prior posts. I wrote stuff 1) you didn't know about; and 2) you have hard time internalising. (even after reading about it)<br>
This is not exactly unknown. There was some RAND report. Or when Steve Bannon says "flood the field with sh*t"—he intuitively gets it. Other people too stumble on the scheme from time to time.<br>
The beauty of it is—even after people learn, they will refuse to internalise it. Remember—vanity, and that child thinking (wholly reasonably!) "it can't be that—every grown up I know and trust, every story I have ever heard." (about Santa)<br>
IDK how they stumbled on this. Requires only 2 components: 1) total information control; and 2) production of stories (without any bearing to reality) on an industrial scale. So you discard the 95% but in the 5% you still imbibe what they produce. It works—so Kremlin keeps using it.<br>

What can it possibly rely on? You don't live in Russia, you don't work in the Kremlin. To see for yourself. What other possible source of reliable information can you hope to have? No journalist can know anything other than what Kremlin told them. As simple as.<br>
You say you are a realist. Nothing wrong there. And then you draw conclusions. Fine. But what from, from what information, do you conclude what you conclude. If you say "I have 0 information", then you will have "0 opinion". But your opinion to what is true and what is false is not 0, it's not "I'm perfectly ignorant, anything is possible".<br>
There is a general pattern. (e.g. Greeks vs. Latins) Easterners think of Westerners as bit of vain, as having tad too good opinion of themselves. That—relative to an arbitrary yardstick—is somewhat true. So they usually will feed you something, don't leave you with nothing. As you hate not knowing, then you'd think less of yourselves.<br>
That works for the better and for the worse. In the positive for the better: if I have exaggerated opinion of myself, I will try to live to it, put the effort. And some of that will pan out! In the negative for the worse—I will think to know more than I really know.<br>
The obverse opinion, where Latins think of Greeks as cheating lying no-goodies is also observed. Also not entirely unfounded.<br>

You are wrong there. Any reasonable asessment is that Russia will seek control over Ukraine. This is just the latest instalment. The invasion was after the other means failed.<br>
You should not think Catherine Belton knows anything. Or that Kremlin will tell Catherine their plans. Or that Kremlin saying X, tells you much about X. They say plenty obvious lies, and will continue to. (e.g. "there will be no invasion", "no Russian army in Crimea", "Crimea parliament voted", "elections organised and won", "no Russian army in east Ukraine", "didn't down any airplanes" and on and on; the list is long, all the way back to Stalin times)<br>
From their point of view—you are like children, that are being told stories about Santa Claus. Anything remotely plausible—goes.<br>
You will get 100% totally manufactured virtual reality. You don't know much about those distant foreign lands. And you are reasonable people. So you will go: "ok, maybe 95% is propaganda, but it can't be 100% all lies". (or at least very unlikely; that's your error, that's where they get you; it's "unlikely", but "not impossible") So you will swallow the 5% that are also lies, as truth.<br>
That suffices for Kremlin. That's why they 1) need total information space control; and 2) must produce b/s on an industrial scale. But—it's cheap, it's easy, it works. That's why they keep doing it.<br>

Given that the economy has barely grown for decades now, and esp on a per capita basis, would that no imply that non-net-zero economy shrank by exact the same amount?<br>
UK population living standards have stagnated. While UK gov has been pursuing net zero. With the same mindset, industrial revolution would not have happened and UK would be living in 2025 very similar to 1725.<br>
With passage of time—well run economy should be expanding, not staying the same. This is less than the winning argument you think it is.<br>

I don't see how atm. If we had working v100 of Neuralink interface, seemless and convenient, that increased the speed of communication between us humans from current <100bps (and until 10-20yrs it was in close proximity alone; only increased million-fold with the mass digital comms recently) a million fold to 100Mbps, then I'd think singularity possible, yes.<br>

I'd risk a guess: when empty std::vector is passed, vec.size() returns 0, which is of unsigned type, so then the -1 down by one from 0, flips it to 0xff..ff, so then (unsigned) index i goes to the max unsigned for the size_t. (bar the last, as it's "<"; too bad the usual "!! danger !! danger !!" signal for unsigneds-in-for-loop that is "<=" is missing here to trigger the paranoid)<br>
IMO 1.5 bads conspire to a disaster:<br>
1- unsigned-s in loops is asking for trouble.<br>
0.5- size_t hiding its unsignedness is unhelpful (usize_t and ssize_t, should have been).<br>
One for the likes of "Writing Solid Code" by S. Maguire which is repeatedly shown a very useful reading. That rare book both high level and low level lessons too at the same time!<br>
And using this opportunity to plugin a bugbear.<br>
It's disapponting how hard it is to write non-defective code from get go. It's like walking barefoot in a snake pit. Even after decades of standardisation.<br>
How does one even use integers when the risk of turning over overflowing is ever present?? With great difficulty! If one aims to at least try avoid in-correctness from the get-go. I personally maintain few levels-of-paranoid. E.g. here checking for "vec.size() > 0", with: XSTATIC at comptime, XCHECK at runtime release & debug mode, XASSERT at runtime debug only. Doable—but such a faff, should be much easier to do the right thing.<br>
Crazy that we have floats with NaNs, Inf and -Inf and signalling, but we still lack signalling integers. Personally I'd like to have (for 32 bit ints) NaN=0x8000, +Inf=0x7FFF, -Inf=0x8001, rules like floating point has (e.g. "every op on a NaN results in NaN"), and interrupt/exception on rollover. Defaulting to "Ignore" handler for backward compatibility. (bonus: ranges on the +ve and the -ve sides are same size, can guarantee unary minus operation is always possible).<br>
I suspect the reason things "mostly work ok" is because with 64-bit ints nowadays it's almost impossible to overflow, tbh.<br>

Then additionally I'm mindful of Bismarck observation, for the impact, that "energetic" (so "energetic and stupid") is v.important too as it amplifies the damage. As in - what damage 1 energetic fool inflicts on others (incl pos on self too), takes 10-20 smart industrious people fix undo after.<br>

I fear it's a moral failing primarily, (this - https://x.com/ljupc0/status/1893854919624421485).<br>
I hope it's not but I fear it is. Heard the argument once. Applied it to small number few extreme cases I could think of (on both sides, stupid - yes/no), seemed to have some signal, some juice. That seemed really bad news to me.<br>

Yeh it's a matter of taste.<br>
I am mainly concerned with code reading and getting errors out in the open early and often. Examples I usually see take much space, while doing little for some kinda a substantial fallback or recovery. Lots of Buck for not much Bang for my taste.  😉<br>
Stack unwind losing the default context prob doesn't help. Have been jaded by too many "A file operation failed but I will not tell you the file pathname" handlers I guess? Yeah I understand they are supposed to pass that info to the handler.<br>
For a remedy that is - "crash!" - well my XCHECK XASSERT already does it, with less vertical space taken, and less distraction from the business logic. (and even launches a debugger attaches to the process in the right stack frame. 😁 )<br>

for most ("normal") people stupidity is a moral failing primarily; only a secondary effect it's un-intelligent, unable to reason, un-adapting, can't reach goals etc; but a primary cause, at it's root - it's bad bad morals.<br>

I must admit—I don't like exceptions. They are too much like hidden goto-s for my taste. If there is a possibility of a jump—I want to to be explicit and obvious tbh.<br>
Remember reading early on C++ exceptions a paper on writing with-exceptions stack class. There were many unseen pitfalls. That left an impression on me. I thought—maybe only 1 in 10K programmers would get this right.<br>

Does US use gas? Didn't one of the persons on that pic just tell all "it's a world market for gas"? (when the latest Ofgem limit raise, i.e. another price hike for us) If it is a single world market—how is gas cheap for US, or Norway, and expensive for UK? Or any other country that has lower electricity price than the UK.<br>
At some point, everyone should ask themself: "can I imagine evidence, any evidence, what will convince me that I'm wrong". If there is—good. If not—then I have crossed over to religion.<br>

It's bad how hard it is to write non-defective code from get go. It's like walking barefoot in a snake pit.<br>
How does one even use integers when the risk of turning over overflowing is ever present?? With great difficulty to stay correct. I end up checking (e.g. vec.size() > 0), with: XSTATIC at comptime, XCHECK at runtime release & debug mode, XASSERT at runtime debug only. Doable—but such a faff, should be much easier to do the right thing. Alt—just accept the less-than-correct code.<br>
It's wild that we have floats with NaNs, Inf and -Inf and signalling, but we still lack signalling integers?? IDK what happened there. (C standards committee asleep at the wheel?)<br>
I'd like to have (for 32 bit ints) NaN=0x8000, +Inf=0x7FFF, -Inf=0x8001, rules like floating point has (e.g. "every op on a NaN results in NaN"), and interrupt/exception on rollover. With default to "Ignore" handler for backward compatibility. (bonus: ranges on the +ve and the -ve sides are same size; can guarantee unary minus operation is always possible).<br>
The only reason things mostly work is because with 64-bit ints nowadays it's almost impossible to overflow, tbh.<br>

Putin just rebuffed your advances with "No—I want control over the whole of Ukraine". As he's been saying for years. (and plenty of people have told you.) What's your grand plan now? You can't force Ukrainians to just lie down and die. They will fight Russia as it's "give me freedom or give me death" for them.<br>
Allowing Ukraine to fall to Russia is a bad idea from the PoV of nuclear war being in the top-3 human species extinction risks. It's on the path of the most likely scenario for a nuclear war. Eastern/Europe will not lay down be rolled by Putin. They didn't for Hitler, nor for Napoleon. They will fight back. Europeans are combustable, rambunctious bunch. They have gone to the ends of Earth and raised all manner of hell! They will not take the Russian nonsense quietly, nuclear war or not.<br>
Poland + Baltics + Nordics must get own MAD deterrent to short circuit that. Without—we continue on the WW3 path. We have the same setup as the one leading to WW2: distant power "guarantee" of security, but without the real will for it. So not actually deterring anything pre- the conflict. But guaranteeing involvement post- the conflict start. A poor setup for the purpose of keeping peace—but a very potent one for starting wars!<br>
Impossible to see the future. But a natural progression with Greater Russia absorbing Ukraine (and esp their battle hardened army), and united with Belarus (post Lukashenka, Russia manoeuvres in a less independent minded ruler) is to invade the Baltics next. US will not get involved at this point. No US president will risk a nuclear war over "distant lands of which we know little". Emboldened Russia invades Poland next. At this point US gets involved. This is the path to a hot war, and ending in a Nuclear one.<br>

Don't have that strong feelings tbh. I mess with computers computing code writing, read what ideas other people dream up, try observe what feedback reality gives back, revise try again.<br>
Personal rule of thumb—for things that failed in v1 and even v2, did something new (in adjacent field?) happen since, to make us hope reasons for previous fails be circumvent in v3?<br>
Things I have some hope to pan out, to become mass instance, in my lifetime:<br>
- Bioinformatics, genetics, genomics—with GWAS close(r) to v3.<br>
- Medical sensors, monitoring of the inner parts of the body, early intervention.<br>
- Embryo screening, possibly interventions, again GWAS small diffs, but add to meaningful change, esp with compounding over lifetime.<br>
- MOOC—Massive Open Online Courses, close to v3 now? With AI interactivity may scale up finally, chance to realise Bloom 2-sigma mastery learning.<br>
- Scaling up R&D innovation discovery with ML-AI. Types 1-2 thinking Tik-Tok cadence: type 1—pattern recognition, idea generation; type 2—chain of thought logical thinking, tear down most coming from 1, what survives may be of some value; repeat 1-2 alternate ad infinitum.<br>
- (minor but personal bug bear) Universal enough Babel fish dialogue translator in my hand if not my ear.<br>
Things unlikely to live to see in my lifetime even if I'd have wanted to:<br>
- Robotics—seems we are getting close to v1 of wider adoption. Discounting Roombas there that didn't pan out, I'd put them at v0.5, not even v1. 😄<br>
- Biology modelling. Virtual cell models for cell types. In silico testing before wet lab testing.<br>
- Quantum computing (QC) possibly provide the means to partly address the curse of dimensionality. At least the compute side of it. (if not the data size side) Data grows exp-onentially with dimensions—sad. But-QC computation grows exp-onentially with number of qubits too.<br>
Enough I hope—I'll stop dreaming now. 😂<br>

Me too, 😀 and so does everyone else. It's a bet. I'm ngl I'm apprehensive as anyone how it turns out—for it's a bet. Anyone telling you about the future with certainty is deceiving you, and maybe themselves too.<br>
But imagine if the spread of mechanical gizmos and latter electric devices was proscribed, censored, stymied, by the powers of the day. (kings etc) And Cambrian explosion of objects that make our lives so much easier and better now didn't happen. Imagine our lives now not that different to what they were pre-1800. Wouldn't we think, knowing now what is possible—"wow what opportunity lost"?<br>
I'm thinking of the analogue in the current Information Revolution. Things show promise, but for various reasons, don't pan out, and petter out. Not impossible. Every obstacle thrown in front increases the chance of that. (e.g. in ML/AI—quite a few of the things people didn't think they were right about, turned out—they were; just to early; or not ambitious enough to go in hard-to-the-max then some more)<br>
So here is to hoping that similar Cambrian explosion of AI infused magical gizmos in every nook and cranny of life deliver another x10-x20 times increase in quality of life for humanity. Given how much scale turns out matters—the more of humanity gets of that, the better imo.<br>

Trump track record negotiating with the Taliban is poor.<br>
None of us know any details—but the PR blitz coming from Muskites in your camp vibes "we give Russia everything before they ask, and even stuff they don't ask for".<br>
Silver lining: maybe Baltics - Poland - Nordics will finally get their fingers out, start acting in on the clear and present risks, and in 2-3 years maybe they will have their own nuclear deterrent.<br>
The idea the US will risk anything much, let alone nuclear annihilation, for Europe atm looks absurd. US stingy even with old hardware—both parties. Not talking about putting any US lives at risk—just old hardware you have lying around aplenty.<br>
Think your stance is a silver lining, b/c I also think that #1 known danger is nuclear war. (unknown danger—a meteorite)<br>
Allowing Ukraine to fall to Russia is a bad idea from that PoV. B/c that's on the path of the most likely scenario for a nuclear war. Eastern Europe and Europe in general will not lay down be rolled by Putin. They didn't for Hitler, nor for Napoleon. Europeans will fight back. They are combustable, rambunctious bunch. They have gone to the ends of Earth and raised all manner of hell! They will not take the Russian nonsense quietly, nuclear war or not.<br>
Having two World Wars started in Europe—the only world wars! and not one but two of them! (once an accident - but twice??)—the overwhelming chance is that nuclear war does start in Europe. We are some way towards it. (slow moving chronic since 2014 Crimea; fast moving acute the last 3yrs since Feb-2022)<br>
Poland + Baltics + Nordics must get own MAD deterrent to short circuit that. Without—we continue on the WW3 path. We have the same setup as the one leading to WW2: distant power "guarantee" of security, but without the real will for it. So not actually deterring anything pre- the conflict. But guaranteeing involvement post- the conflict start! A poor setup for the purpose of increasing the chance of peace, and decreasing the chance of war—in fact exactly the opposite.<br>
Impossible to see in the future.

Most UKR-s have nowhere to go. It's not only basic loss of freedom.<br>
More than one prime TV Russia hosts openly call for extinguishing of the whole UKR nation. At minimum, that means the UKR language forbidden from state-anything. If not outright banned from public life. Teachers, poets, writers etc exiled or killed. UKR already have one "lost generation" of culture workers 100 years ago.<br>
If you are UKR in that Greater Russia I imagine you will be always suspect as potential enemy of the state. The Russian state has been horrid to the Russians for lesser things. Can't imagine what it will do to non-Russians. We have a foretaste of how occupied Ukraine will look in the parts that have been now occupied for 3 years.<br>
It will be carnage, mass murder as customary on The Bloodlands of the 20-th century.<br>

Yeah they hate Zel with passion. Unkind to speculate—but hey this' X so why not. 😅<br>
Maybe "bones spurs" "warriors" project there? Feel in themselves they would have fled in Feb-2022. Hate on the dude for being brave. They suspect they'd have been cowards.<br>
IDK what Zel family situation is. Can't not notice that Musk family stuff seems tad chaotic. Various concubines communicating with him in public on X, desperate to get his attention on family matters??<br>
As per the above—mild title-tattle while lazying about on Sat evening. 😆 I have not got any knowledge except what's public on the Internet.<br>

Useful idiots are forever.<br>
Sachs was a useful idiot for the USG in the '90s. He is a useful idiot now, shilling for Putin/oligarchs. He has not changed one iota. The same zeal, the same certainty, total lack of introspection.<br>
Initially Sachs outsourced his thinking to the USG. Everything the USG told him, JS multiplied by +1. So merrily, merrily, he went on to administer Shock Therapy to Borat oiks. That turned out to be a mistake.<br>
JS's lesson learned was "Aw shucks, *damn* you, USG! From now on, I’ll multiply everything the USG says by -1." Where it should have been, "I distrust the USG and take no note of them." I multiply what they say with 0.<br>
JS seems has decided to multiply everything the Russian government tells him by +1 this time around. Sure genius - it will work better this time. For the Russian government is well known for its trustworthiness and not telling any lies, ever! 😂<br>

If you can read my data so can the Chinese Intelligence. It's that simple. Leave a back door open, and everyone will get in. Same for your data.<br>
I thought after 40 years of crypto wars, when earlier this year it was revealed that Chinese had tapped the US splitters feeds that was a lesson learned?<br>
Do you think all these mathematicians cryptographers telling you what you refuse to hear are unpatriotic? Do you think they are traitors? You should think less of yourself. Your dunderheaded obstinence is putting us all in danger.<br>
Police will find another way to deal with whatever you fear. Don't conscript the poor abuse victims into your misguided cause. You have no right to use their suffering for this.<br>
What you are attempting to do-it's not that it's stupid because it's impossible. No-it's because this will fail in the worst possible moment to cause UK the most damage. Act smart, act clever. Enough with this galactic stupidity already ffs!<br>

Eh. Didn't some game on ZX-Spectrum (Elite maybe? ported fom BBC B?) have 1) point stack pointer to the video memory 2) push zeros (2 bytes) clear screen quicker than thought possible. (Z80A, 4MHz)<br>
Boulderdash on Commodore-64 (6510, 1MHz) used the video chip "raster register" (current screen line drawn) as source of randomness. Possibly fed into a register of the audio chip (SID or sth?) as part of defining attack-decay-sustain-relese waveform params. Creating a semi-random catchy tune. The whole subroutine <100 bytes 6502 machine code.<br>
Most C64 games used NMI generated when line drawn on screen matched one set to the video chip (VIC?) register, to swap around sprites definitions. So about each (horizontal) third of the screen had its own set of 8 (?) sprites.<br>

Various TV programs, talking heads on daily TV prime time programs, etc. One needs to be native speaker (I'm not), know some of the home scene too.<br>
There is a service that collects and translates them to English. Something-something-monitoring. You can also read kremlin dot ru in English and make up your mind.<br>
I lived through the YU wars in the 1990-s, and it's the same Mode of Operation regarding how things work. State TV channels will "channel" what the ruler wants the plebs to know. State paid talking heads, the informative programs on prime time TV etc.<br>
(there other similarities too; e.g. Russia use of russians living outside Russia is similar to the way Serbia used serbs outside it; similar to the way germans outside Germany were used etc)<br>

Trying to "read the mind" of Putin is not productive, is fools' errand, as 1) not possible 2) any mind can change. And there will be another Putin-like after Putin too.<br>
Imo it's better to:<br>
1) Read what Putin/Kremlin writes, tells us, on kremlin dot ru. It's translated into English for our benefit.<br>
For context, we are to check Tucker's Putin & Dugin interviews. Us we are better off to listen what they say. (however uncomfortable to us.) They grant Tucker interviews so they relay their message to us.<br>
2) Watch what the state propaganda tells the Russians on TV. That is clear, plain, unambiguous. For even if Putin/Kremlin don't need genuine elections, they still need to have the public with them. They can't willy-nilly turn things on a dime. They will telegraph well in advance what their plans are.<br>
(and follow on that for real, most of the time; also mentioned in the Sarah Paine old Dwarkesh interview, she's observant lucid so noticed it)<br>

+1 I agree with everything above and thought the same Re: the grand plan and how various companies fit in.<br>
Also agree #1 known danger is nuclear war. (unknown danger—a meteorite hitting us)<br>
So allowing Ukraine to fall to Russia is a really bad idea. B/c that's how nuclear war starts! Eastern Europe and Europe in general will not lay down and be rolled by Putin. They didn't for Hitler, nor did they for Napoleon. Europeans will fight back. They are combustable, rambunctious bunch. They have gone to the ends of Earth and raised all manner of hell! They will not take the Russian nonsense quietly, nuclear war or not.<br>
Having two World Wars started in Europe—the only world wars! and not one but two of them! (once an accident-but twice??)—the overwhelming chance is that nuclear war does start in Europe. We are 1/6-1/5 way towards it. (slow moving chronic since 2014 Crimea; fast moving in the last 3yrs since Feb-2022)<br>
Now. Poland + Baltics + Nordics must get MAD deterrent. Without—we continue on the WW3 path. We have the same setup as the one leading to WW2: distant power "guarantee" of security, but without the real will for it. So not actually deterring anything pre- the conflict. But guaranteeing involvement post- the conflict start! A very poor setup for the purpose of increasing the chance of peace, and decreasing the chance of war—in fact exactly the opposite.<br>
Impossible to see in the future. But a natural progression with Greater Russia absorbing Ukraine (and esp their battle hardened army), and united with Belarus (post Lukashenka, Russia manoeuvres in a less independent minded ruler) is to invade the Baltics next. US will not get involved at this point either. No US president will risk a nuclear war over "distant lands of which we know little". Emboldened Russia invades Poland next. At this point US gets involved. This is the path to a hot war, ending in a Nuclear one.<br>
The pro-MAD argument for Poland + Baltics + Nordics is the same as<br>

Agent Orange has by then long forgotten the saga. But is uugely pleased with the result. He's loving him a winner! Maybe even gets "concessions" to "rare mineral earths" or some such pioneer gold-star sticker award. (five thousand million billions worth of!—uuge!!)<br>

Leave it to each and every one to decide for themselves. That's all everyone wants.<br>

It's the SOP Standard Operating Procedure, manufacturing popularity for your own policies.<br>
In the post/communist countries, they go a step further: just create your own opposition! That way, no matter if the position or the opposition win, you are on the winning side.<br>
(in Russia Putin had the same for a time-but then he dispensed even with that pretence)<br>

They shouldn't ban anything. They should let the public decide with their feet.<br>
How is this even difficult?? The negation of "mandated vaccines" is not "forbidden vaccines". It is - "let every one person decide for themselves".<br>

I'm mostly agreeing with "the state creates the demos". True that - disparate people with a group potential coalesce around common idea(l)s, that smaller number creates the State, then that the State creates the (larger) Demos.<br>
With EU the complication is that the existing Nations, and their Nation states. They are quite strong. Europe level institution would have to attract the various people's of Europe with something, that they can offer, that current nation states lack, or are found in want of.<br>
For trust, I imagine pre-requisite for trust is transparency. (necessary, but not sufficient)<br>

Heh - I hear you. But please continue the chain of thought where it leads you. And you will see for yourself why it's not happening.<br>
Parliament voting laws implements parliamentary democracy. For DemoCracy, the rule of the Demos - one needs Demos! What is Demos?<br>
Currently Demos means - Nation. A nation is currently the largest group of people, where the defeated 49%, accept the will of the winning 51% peacefully (for a preset limited period of time). Don't seceed, don't break off into their own separate group with own separate parliament and state and the whole jazz. (it's reasonable to follow up "why"; that chain ends in "trust", the-magic✨-dust 😊)<br>
There is no European nation. So there is no European Demos. So there can be no European wide democracy.<br>
EU is a Union of Nation States, or Nations - not of individual citizens. Other things flow from this - e.g things named the familiar, like Parliament, but functioning in unfamiliar ways. It would be indeed simpler for all if European Demos existed.<br>
UK being old anachronistic is home to 3.5 nations. So I can see the potential fault lines. I am atuned to spotting tiny cracks of these kinds (with potential) having grown up in YU. 😎<br>

A scenario. Zelensky resists, then at some point goes "ok, elections then"... and "...for the low low price of 30 Patriot-s, 130 F16-s..." (or whatever other weapons they need).<br>
Then he makes a deal with his competitors - the warrior-general, the poisoned ex-president, ... - offering them significant positions in the new admin or sth. Then special law is brought in as a great concession to the MAGA-dumbbells. ("elections in wartime, innit!") Then he wins by a landslide.<br>
Winning a US PR battle, more weapons for UKR, and strengthening national unity too. Putin loses. (again)<br>
Agent Orange has by then forgotten the saga, is uuge(!)ly pleased with the result, is loving the winner! Maybe even gets "concessions" to random "rare minerals" or similar pioneer gold-star sticker award. (five thousand million billions worth of!-uuge!!)<br>
A conspirator may suspect Budanov dreamt up the whole thing. I'm less certainty minded. I know of life stranger than fiction. But say - opportunity kicks your way, then...-who knows? Nothing more american than make lemonade out of lemons tbh.<br>

That's too broad a take. Depends - which humanities, and where. (in/out of academia) I can think of:<br>
Arts - performing arts are embracing generative models, as they embrace any tools thrown their way. The way usually embracing happens - old established will shy away, new upstarts use new tools to make space for themselves under the sun.<br>
Philosophy, religion - have plenty to say, and plenty are saying.<br>
Writing - fiction, science fiction. Enough said. Most ideas we entertain now started there. Fertile grounds. Could say - they have done very well.<br>
Linguistics - sadly they were gripped by a cult, in-toto with a cult leader. But incoming young minds there will adapt. Funeral by funeral there, the advance.<br>
Law - they should be able to advance much. Not thinking here of the silly censorship laws. I'm in the UK. Most laws seem to be poor in conception, drafting, execution - just poor all around!? Lawyers have occupied the commanding heights of society, the results are now in - and they are uniformly bad! Even in their supposed area of expertise - law! - these people seem as competent as a monkey doing my daily programming. Law is code, it is the Operating System of society. Plenty of low hanging fruit in law it seems. Should be able to improve a lot there.<br>

IDK, never been to China.<br>
Three out of three people I know who visited came back less impressed than when they left. Usually - "the more you know the less you like it" is a bearish indicator.<br>
The picture you and I have of China is the picture as imagined by it's current rulers. They control every sight and sound, every idea about it, originating there. One needs to go spend time on the ground live there to learn.<br>
UK following China? Doubt British people will be looking forward to a social safety net "with Chinese characteristics". 😂 Or solving career/repeat criminals with a "bullet in the head". Or I imagine UK sentimental love of animals finding itself in China... - uh-oh. 😬<br>
China indeed looks good now, compared to Year Zero levels of insanity of mass starvation, and mass murder. But a more sane counter-factual yard-sticks are Taiwan, or South Korea, in the "what could have been" comparisons. Then - somewhat less impressive.<br>
One rough but useful way to compare places around the world I've found when travelling is to look at "about equal GDP PPP per capita". By that measure ($25K), China is now, as UK was in 1980. Improving things by letting Industrial Revolution happen is good. But hardly exceptional or surprising. Plenty undeveloped countries develop this way.<br>
People disillusioned with Western corruption often look to China's 'country-above-business' model as the opposite of the US's 'business-above-country' approach. Looks impressive-until you realise that country's represent (the party) on that hierarchy is effectively a self-selected self-appointed mafia type special interest group. With some to recommend, but plenty to dis-recommend too.<br>
Latest turn with the emperor Xi for life, in-toto with the cult of personality etc. That doesn't look like a particular innovation or something that has not been tried and tested before. (and found wanting) TBS if they manage to adapt to increase domestic consumption and transition away from export dependent industries. So far they have followed the "Asian Tiger" path, if scaled up.<br>
To all of the above, standard counter is "Yeah, but Western democracies are broken too." That is indeed true. (and everywhere, at all times, to some degree) However - freedom of speech freedom of thought makes it easier to analyse problems, organise, propose solutions, execute fixes to the problems, change society. (and no doubt create the next set of problems to challenge) Change, reform need dissent, dissent needs space to grow. Crushing any new greens just as they sprout - that makes everything that much harder.<br>
AI will bring in a lot of change, it seems.<br>

Yeah - can be made secret, easy enough. Human communication is point to point, so almost private by default.<br>
We need data, information flows to organise humongous numbers of people modern societies are. That and higher fidelity, quality, precision in their actions-both are dependent on a panopticon. Massive surveillance, everyone surveying everyone.<br>
I understand this is contrary to our instinctive desire for privacy. But us citizens consumers already lost our privacy. (and our revealed preferences show we value it little-despite what we say) Google, my bank, UK gov - already know everything about my life. Them being transparent to me, the way I am transparent to them, goes some way towards restoring balance of power.<br>

In the age of mass social media, where everything is copied replicated as default, tbh I have zero expectation for any media to put the effort to fish out any information from the ocean of data.<br>
Radical transparency for every file produced by UK dot gov: every one file should be put up, read only on public cloud drives, on the public web, as default. Secret by request only. Then everyone can just google anything.<br>
I imagine Sir Humphries will be having serial heart attacks at the thought of such idea. :-) Admit I have no idea how does one get to that blessed state of affairs, of radical transparency.<br>

"Counter" would be too strong a word, no? Floating currency can't counter the price increase for real, counter as in "make it less expensive in USD". It can "smear", spread the increased cost in time, and across more users (weaker GBP, inflation). But that's about it.<br>

B/c their longest experience at young age is cooperation within a family group. As a family group we all practice mostly communism: from each according to their abilities (==parents), to each according to their needs (==children).<br>
Communism is the default ideology we imbibe growing up in a family (again-where "parents give to the best of their abilities", and "children get according to their needs"). So it comes to a lot of us instinctively as a first thing, given it's one we know best at that point. Every other system for organising large groups of people (with far less trust than a family) to live together and cooperate & compete productively has to be explicitly taught.<br>
Scale (billions of us living together as opposed say a band of 20-120) is unnatural in a sense - we have not had time to evolve instruments for this. Our biology is not adapted to this fast and recent change. But we adapt via our cultures that are much faster to change.<br>
Our intuition is wrong - communism is *not* a good way to organise billions of people. The wrong idea persists the same way other irrational beliefs persist: we just carry over an idea to a different context without much thinking, don't check evidence about the results of its mis/application, and b/c it's often the only idea we have frankly.<br>
I read similarly in economics  students start as intuitive protectionists anti- free traders, and have to be taught explicitly about the gains from free trade. And then pros- and cons- and how they reconcile, and (to the best of our knowledge) end as net-positive. Same I believe abt the lump of labour fallacy too.<br>
Intuitions we grow up with are simply wrong in the context we are (mis)applying them.<br>

Of course it doesn't discriminate-how could it? It's not like the buyers are willing to pay different price for the same house, if owned for different purposes. And that's a good thing.<br>
UK drop in house prices would be a good thing too. Even if I'm a home owner. Yes, the value of my asset is reduced. However, it also means my kids get to spend less money on their housing. (and more on other things) It's a net positive in my book.<br>

Agreed on that.<br>
But so with any other asset. Like you assume you have 750Bn of Apple shares certificates, then you open the locked drawer after 20 years, and find the shares certificates are gone.<br>
Or you thought 750Bn bought you some advanced weapon. Then you find out it was some military procurement shit show-the weapon does not work. And so on. Gold is not special any more.<br>
Yeah it would affect your credit rating.<br>
But not by much-given this is USG. Probably way less than most people assume. The credit rating of the USG is in reality a unit of measure, and every other US entity is less credit-worthy.<br>
Remember hilarious credit agency scenes, when the credit rating of USG was lowered, and apparently below some random credit paper. 😜 Credit ratings agencies are insanely stupid like that. Good entertainment though. 😂<br>

Thanks for the kind answer. Yes agreed-humans we use much of the neural capacity to keep our bodies and life systems working. The part doing the language spoken written language is minor.<br>
I forgot two further advantages we humans have:<br>
1) Active learning. We don't simply have data presented to us. We actively seek things that are interesting and surprising to us.<br>
("surprising" is a code word for observations our current pdf f_X_Y(x,y) under-represents marks them low probability b/c unobserved, whereas they are not low prob)<br>
We know that robots equipped with a 3D hand able to grip the real 3D world, learn order of magnitude faster their representations of that 3D world.<br>
2) Human learning is multi-modal. We read a book to a child, s/he can see the word on the page, we say it with speech, we point at a picture of the animal associated with the word.<br>
Further, we look at the child, seek feedback, if s/he understood. If not, we repeat once more. Otherwise, we move to the next item to be learned.<br>
AI learning would be like sitting quietly next to a child, just turning pages of the child's book, in silence, at the same pace, while saying nothing, pointing at nothing, not looking at the child if s/he understood anything at all.<br>

TBH I don't see the connection, why anything would suggest that learning should be faster, or slower? Does the fact that a chick growing from egg to flight takes 3 weeks or 6 weeks, suggest anything about whether it takes Boeing to build a plane in 5 months or 8 months? Sorry—I don't see how one tells us much about the other.<br>
Our current ML indeed requires more data than the humans.  It's indeed possible that humans have a more efficient way of learning. But other explanations are possible too.<br>
Regarding data efficiency: it's possible that humans are over-generalisers by design. Evolution may have favoured our ability to learn quickly from limited data, even if that means occasionally drawing exaggerated or "overconfident" conclusions. For instance, when forming a significant "bump" in the probability distribution of "(rustling leaves, tiger)" based on very little evidence. The shape of this distribution might not mathematically reflect the data in a rigorous way, but it might offer a survival advantage to get to some "bump" quickly rather than slowly. Better to over-generalise than under-generalise—the utility of being "wrong and skittish" versus "wrong and eaten" is highly asymmetrical.<br>
Humans have after all say about 30yrs of learning, that's approx 1 billion seconds (1e9), time to learn tune their 100 billion connections (1e11 = 1e9 neurons x 1e2 connections). That's not a lot of data for that many weights. Say we sample our environment at 10 fps, that 1e9 sec will bring in 1e10 observations. To learn 1e11 weights.<br>
Typically it's the other way around when we learn: we want at least 10 observations per parameter. Ofc, the observations maybe very rich. Humans may imbibe arbitrary many bits of information per sample. (1e3? 1e6? IDK) But evolutionary, humans must be quick, or they maybe dead. They don't have the luxury of many epochs, to tune their networks.<br>
You say "we do know what we are doing". Again—from "humans learn different to machines on some axes of difference" does not imply in my mind "we are entirely ignorant".<br>
We are learning a glorified histogram, a continuous probability density function (pdf) f_X_Y(x,y) in the most general case. The vectors x and y have many thousands of dimensions. Typically by convention in a tuple (x,y) we label X the part we observe, while Y we label the part we care about but don't directly observe. Otherwise—in the tuple (x,y) the separation what's x and what's y, is arbitrary.<br>
We typically define an objective function. Then we devise an optimisation algorithm that minimises some measure of error, between the data we observe, and what the function f_X_Y(x,y) tells us about the data we should be expecting to observe. (in the most general case we care about (x,y); in less general cases about y only) The relation f_X_Y(x,y) tells us everything that can ever be know between the two multidimensional qualities X and Y.<br>

I am not disputing that they may indeed do such act of gross stupidity.<br>
It baffles me-why?<br>
They could lure the 1000 people that matter with high wages and get that same result. Conversely, in a war the machines may get destroyed, people get killed.<br>
China the country is not short of land. It's not short of people either. Taiwan people also vaguely support unification with their kin-they are both Chinese. Only presume-not by force, no one likes that no matter what.<br>
Invasion sounds to me self defeating. Many potential downsides. Very little that can't be gained without an invasion.<br>

Yeah, as we are finding with "public lies, private truths": when too many lie in public b/c they would be punished otherwise (either don't say publicly things they privately think are true, or the worse one - say things publicly they privately think are untrue!), a positive feedback is in operation.<br>
First a mass of people lurches one way, we get collectively crazy for a period, then the mass lurches the other way. (the "unwind" to the crazy, e.g. now, depending on your PoV)<br>
I have some sympathy with people that are afraid of free speech. It is indeed true, for us humans to do evil in great quantity, we need large number of us to act in unison. And for that, we need to organise, and for that, we need free speech.<br>
However: banning speech does not make the above impossible. Initially, it does suppress the process. But starts the "private truths public lies" positive feedback loop, so then the process of doing evil is so quick latter, that it catches many by surprise. How can a country descend so quickly to hell? That's how.<br>
I'm now of the opinion that free speech is the less bad of two less-than-ideal options in that respect. As there is no silver bullet, sure-fire way to prevent human madness. We have to make do with what we have.<br>

My pet hypothesis is that the major difficulty is that one needs to start at/with the end/ing, and work back towards the beninging. Quite un-auto-regressive that, to the point of being anti-auto-regressive.<br>
I'm surprised CoT didn't help that much. (but that's AR too) Maybe the likes of difussion-like models for language will improve? (paper yesterday, xB model) They come up with the missing words in unison, filling a words 2D grid for a mask, at the same time per iteration. Maybe better suited.<br>
Together with the nature of humour. Extremely one way direction: easy to understand (verify), very hard to invent (generate). Billions of people thousands of years effort - yet there are not that many (in the grand scheme of things) very good jokes. Esp ones that jump Cultures barriers.<br>
(The surprise factor seems v.hard to me. The writer needs to get in the mind of the listener, feel not only think their expectation, then find a way to defy that very expectation with short & sharp twist of the tongue. Not trivial! Almost some kind of mirror-logic.)<br>

Isn't that the standard result in high-dimensional spaces? That the distribution of angles clusters around 90 fairly quickly with increase of the dimension d.<br>
E.g. https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/189s22/lec/22.pdf<br>
Our intuitions trained on low dimensional spaces (d<=6) fail us,  are actually deceiving us with any non-trivial sized d-dims.<br>
Further, looking at the Nvolume ratio between Nball and Ncube—that tends to zero with increasing dimension d. The space moves to the edges, the centre empties lacks probability mass (even if that was supposed to be representative!), every Npoint is an outlier.<br>

My smallest minimal data set I work with daily takes 25gb. Then they're more datasets on top of it. Yeah I could swap in-out.<br>
And indeed I did that cca 2004! Computers were 32 bit, /3gb win xp switch was a lifesaver, 2gb ram was solid, but 1gb was the norm. Grid computing meant mobos with dual cpus, but otherwise - no multi cores.<br>

Yeah, they are pricey. I started buying them 2nd hand online. Looks there is usually some or other to choose from. Unless one is super pressed for time, or needing latest-greatest.<br>
The 96gb I got recently is M2. Yeah, not the latest-best. But in battery life, in that that RAM is also a Video RAM and is accessed by the GPU and NPU units when running llama.cpp—still no other laptops like it.<br>

On that graph we see 2 time periods when the UK/US price ratio increases.<br>
1) 2003-2008: UK/US goes up, while obviously there was no UKR invasion then. How come UK so much worse?<br>
2) 2022-now: UK/US goes up, there is UKR invasion. But the event happens for US as well as the UK. So how come it affects UK only, or UK much more than US?<br>
Obv RUS invasion of UKR has non-zero effect. But it's far from the whole story. Why UK/US up when no invasion? Why UK/US up when there is invasion? Invasion alone does not explain it.<br>
The above is "from data". We also have "prior knowledge", knowledge about how these system work irl even without looking at data.<br>

Trump will replace Powell with someone that will bring interest rates close to zero. He already articulated that intention in some speech. And Trump is consistent there: he was pro IR=0 even in 2016.<br>
That will decrease those >10% interest payments in the federal budget. That 10% is currently UBI to people that already have $$$. (so they lend those $$$ to USG) Those people can do without that stream of income.<br>
Trump - unlike most econ-drones - feels or knows inflation can fought in denominator (create more stuff), not only in the numerator (reduce $$$ supply) in the inflation=change of [$$$]/[stuff] eq.<br>
Incredibly implausibly, but by now beyond reasonable doubt in my mind, this is missed by 90% of econs.<br>

It's a mystery to me why politicos like PP refuse to speak "human".<br>
PP could have said:<br>
"No, free speech in the UK is not worse than in those other countries".<br>
How difficult is that? How is the non-dialogue (=say words, ensure they're have zero meaning) she went for, do her any favours?<br>
If she was a better politician she could have also confessed:<br>
"UK free speech is undermined by laws my CON party brought in and championed" (the online harms bill).<br>
But that would be too much to expect from it seems a non-entity.<br>
Politicos are offended by the NPC label, yet they keep playing like an NPC. The entire political class.<br>
I'm not completely sure. Do they have other thoughts ideas in their heads, bit refuse to share? Or is this it, this is the extent of their ideas? What we see is what's there. (not all that's much)<br>

"Слобода или смрт" е либерален слоган (американска револуција има "Give me freedom or give me death"), и пошто во МКД химна спомнуваме "Слобода" во 3 од 4 најважни стихови (први два-"Денес над Македонија се раѓа, ново сонце на СЛОБОДАТА", и последни два стиха-"Македонија СЛОБОДНА, СЛОБОДНО живее").<br>

I imagine people will be trying to replicate. Can think of problems-<br>
1) tried, found out didn't scale; 2) recurrent blocks are inherently serial, maybe hard to impossible to paralelise them; 3) scaling prevented by #2, can't even get to #1.<br>

Human behaviour in reproduction has been exactly the opposite to the rabbits.<br>
1) When many children died before they could have children of their own, humans had 5-6 kids, for 2-3 of them to survive, and population was stable.<br>
2) Now that fortunately almost no children die in childhood, humans have dropped the number children they have to about 2, which again points towards stable future population.<br>
If humans were like rabbits, the x10 times increase of living standards since 1800, families would have had 20-30 kids now. Ehrlich wrong again.<br>

Quite the contrast on display.<br>
1) Exhibit A.  @Keir_Starmer , a lawyer, representative MP of his constituent @dannybster , and the PM of UK gov.<br>
(Danny has been wronged egregiously. He spent life changing amounts of own cash $$$ on a flat. The flat was built badly, is in danger of collapsing/pos now valued at 0. Saying that Danny has been failed by everyone and everything is an understatement)<br>
Sir Keir has been wilfully avoiding any contact with Danny on X for many months. He can help Danny on 3 accounts: being a lawyer, being his MP, and being the PM of HMG. Seems he's decided not to.<br>
2) Exhibit B.  @JDVance engaging with ideas expressed by an average X user, using his very own fingers, to tap-tap-tap write his thoughts on his very own phone, and broadcast them to millions! 🤯<br>

ASI—Possible or Not? Well—"possible" is a stronger word than my knowledge allows me to claim. No human can see the future.<br>
But I do think ASI is *not impossible*. And that’s plenty good? No known laws of physics—or any other fundamental constraints of nature—make ASI impossible. Quite lucky, that, to be honest!<br>
We’ve already seen machines surpass us in limited domains—first in chess, then in Go (c.f. an excellent documentary on YouTube), and more recently in protein folding, where AI has helped determine the 3D structures of proteins, paving the way for breakthroughs in their functionality.<br>
(That’s no slight to humans. Quite the opposite. Just as a combine harvester or a metal press amplifies our physical strength, these neural networks—the most complex machines we’ve ever built—multiply our intellectual strength. I see no shame in that. Only kudos to humanity for reaching this point.)<br>
So I hope ASI will help us solve problems we’ve been stuck on for decades. A major breakthrough, for example, would be making cancer a manageable, non-deadly condition—like AIDS is today. (Notice how there are no celebrity deaths from AIDS in gossip columns anymore? In the 1990s-2000s, there was one every other week. AIDS has became chronic, is no longer acute; nb few even noticed btw)<br>
Will ASI Be Friendly? I think so. We are making an effort to imbue these systems with the best of humanity, not the worst.<br>
We tend to anthropomorphize everything—so naturally, we fear AI thinking "it may destroy us." But we fear that because we destroy things, often needlessly. We assume it will act like us. But why should it?<br>
Yes—we humans have a destructive streak. Yes—we could make ASI as destructive as we are (or worse! use in the battlefield and its super-quick evolution we witness in RUS-UKR war is a worry). Either willingly (a bigger risk) or by accident (a smaller but real risk). But there is no physical law—no immutable constraint—that requires that outcome.<br>
We can choose to endow ASI with the best of us—while leaving the worst out. TBS if we succeed. But in my mind, we are far better off trying than not trying.<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
I'm sorry it's frustrating for you. Here—a pic to cheer you up. 😊<br>
More seriously—we obv disagree on the risks of things that may or may not happen in the future. We said our pieces.<br>
I think AI—AGI, ASI—reduces the probability of humanity ending. That P(doom) is reduced if we have and use AI. I rate:<br>
1-nuclear war;<br>
2-asteroid hitting earth;<br>
3-runaway climate change;<br>
...as major risks.<br>
And T800 terminators taking over and enslaving us—only as a minor risk. A risk well worth taking.<br>
You wonder who Thanos is. For me—Thanos is Mother Nature. My grandparents (and their grand-... parent, since the dawn of humanity) all had 5-6 kids. But the population was stable. How did that happen? It hapenned b/c 3-4 of those kids were all dead, before thay could have kids of their own.<br>
That macabre dance only stops with the Industrial Revolutions. Starting in England and North-West of Europe at about 1800, and now spreading all around the world. The latest AI revolution is a continuation of that.<br>
You think otherwise. That's fine with me. Tolerance is a fair price for freedom.<br>

Appreciate the input. If you feel strongly about this, it's worth getting a job at, or asking people that do these jobs at the Fed or the Treasury, and finding out for yourself. Ask the doers how fiat currency works.<br>
If my balance is 0 at the start of the day today, then I have income of 10 tokens, and I spend 15 tokens, there is no law of physics that prevents recording -5 tokens on my account. It's the human made rule—of my bank who owns the spreadsheet with my current account cell in it—that prevents recording below 0. (or maybe below -1 if I have an overdraft agreed with them.) That's it. So there is never danger that universe prevents writing down a negative number. The danger is that I created, I spent into being 5 tokens more than existed at the start of the day. They will add to the existing tokens, chasing the same goods, increasing the price pressure—potentially inflation.<br>
Over time I have come to understand that the fiat system offends the identity of about 25% percent of the population. So will not be coming back to this post.<br>

All people, all living creatures, have thoughts, I don't know "the full extent of" (and I suspect-neither do they). And yes, they are all "deployed" in the environment around me.<br>
In fact-they keep me alive even. If they stopped existing with an evil Thanos deleting them in an instant-I too would probably die. For I can't live without them.<br>

Then some of the answers you got—you may answer them yourself. Or find some other questions as more interesting or pressing.<br>
I myself think of "thoughts emerging"—being very concrete. "Thoughts" being the many thousands dimensional vectors of numbers. Each number being the activation, the output of a single neuron. Billions of them, in the many many hidden layers of the NN. So for me to say "knowledge of weights and architecture is not necessary" to observe "thoughts", is absurd. Of course it's necessary for any mere mortal like myself.<br>

It's trivially true that the only way to get "insolvent" is to<br>
1) decide to not pay the bills arriving; e.g. by an act of the legislature; or<br>
2) run out of integer numbers. (IDK how that can happen)<br>
Given that "tokens" that are the "payment" for goods delivered or services rendered, are literally being created by typing them in a computer.<br>
*Inflation* is the real danger. Not insolvency.<br>
This is just the reality of any fiat currency. It's in the name-"fiat". (before anyone mmt-s me-this' nothing to do with any econ "school"; it's the law of the land)<br>

I have a lot of time for DC. Obv not a politician, not likeable/hated by too many, will never get elected.<br>
But - clear eyed, 1) good track record observing, and 2) forecasting. And 3) realistic/honest even when reality obv hurtful to his own ego/desires.<br>
E.g. in this interview https://archive.is/otTjs acknowledging the reality of Brexit being a f*ckup, things didn't work out. (takes precedence over reality denying ego-massage for personal comfort; I voted remain; few other insider snippets too)<br>

Leave your granny alone, no need to involve her. :-)<br>
Once I have the architecture as code, and the weights, NNs are complete while boxes. As open as any system possibly can be. I can run signals through them forward and backward, I can put adaptors on the top of them, lobotomise the weights and so on.<br>
I don't see how a system can be more open than that.<br>
You say "difficult". Sure, I agree. I don't claim NNs are "easy". Why would I do that?? NNs are difficult. (chiefly b/c we have not had a Gauss or a Leibniz recently to figure the maths for us) Being "open" is necessary, but not sufficient.<br>
IDK what are you arguing about tbh.<br>

Most of the time-yes, agreed. But once in 35-50 years, a bigger change is needed. The old system is failing on multiple fronts.<br>
BoJo was a wannabe disruptor, cosplaying change. But he was not one willing to put in the work needed. A wordcel into PR and writing books.<br>
The way UK us going - Farage is going to end the next PM. And he will be ineffective too! He is also a charlatan unwilling to put in the hard graft.<br>
It used to be physicists in the 20th century that could do anything, capable of every feat. Looks to me in the 21st century the CompSci TechBros are like that.<br>

My point was:<br>
1) If I have the option to run AI that's "open everything" (open source, open weights, open thoughts) - that I still stand a chance to retain control.<br>
2) AI doomers like Dario/Anthropic want they themselves to control the AI. Then I don't stand a chance.<br>
3) The JD Vance speech at the Paris summit indicated to me decreased power of the AI doomers like Dario/Anthropic.<br>
Ergo—Vance speech was good news in my book. There is still a chance for option#1 to not die.<br>

Mass hysteria? Humans are not exactly immune to mass delusions. Our intelligence is collective-so is our stupidity.<br>
IDK what goes in other peoples minds. You can ask them-many are on online, accessible.<br>
An honest forecaster would:<br>
1) Write down (event,date) tuple. What exactly will happen, and (by) when.<br>
2) Bet something they hold personally dear, something that it would pain them to lose, on their forecast. Such that they lose that thing dear to them, should they forecast wrong.<br>
The people one the list are people like you and me, not gods. They can not see in the future.<br>
There are only few good books on forecasting. Tetlocks's "Superforecasting" is about ok, Silver's "The Signal and the Noise" think it's better. (most written on forecasting is rubbish)<br>
On the wider subject of "reasoning" - Kahneman "Thinking Fast and Slow" is fine if long, Galef "The Scount Mindset" maybe most popular shortest easiest to digest. hth<br>

You are not wrong, and while true, what you say is not the complete truth.<br>
You are taking Kurzweil, looking back, and concluding "he got it right". He did get it right, and good on him for that.<br>
But: cast your mind to Kurzweil as he was 10 or 20 years ago. How many thought, then at time t, "Kurzweil will be right at time t+20yrs"? How many other like Kurzweil, at time t, also had predictions, and different predictions to Kurzweil's, and are now forgotten, b/c these predictions did not pan out?<br>
Even with Kurzweil track record so far: does that say much about the next 20 years track record? Not as much as we like to think. Tracking forecasters and the persistence of their forecasts is even more complicated then the forecasts themselves.<br>
Many fields pretend they know more than they know, b/c that position of great knowledge bestows great power on the pretender. They can say: "I know how it's going to be, listen to me and do as I say".<br>
(aside-there is well known financial engineering scam: at time t one writes 1024 emails, 512 "market up", the other 512 "market down" 1yr forecasts, noting in the process which email got which forecast; in t+1yr, now one writes to the 512 addresses where the previous year's forecast turned out correct, 256 "market up" and another 256 "market down" emails, and so on; you see where this is going: in 10 years, there will be 1 person where the sender correctly forecast the market up/down-s for 10 straight years in a row! one can go an solicit investment from that one "mark" with "well surely the scammer possess an extraordinary skill in the markets")<br>

One can live in hope. 😇 But I fear Sir Humphreys in the UK gov will take the opposite lesson from the US.<br>
You are right about transparency there - not just transparency, but Radical Transparency is necessary (if not sufficient) to keep  a gargantuan system that is the gov machine from veering off track in any number of random directions.<br>
Rather than "secrecy by default" and things made public only 1) at gov will 2) at FoI request (oft frustrated by the bureaucracy in execution), Radical Transparency (RT) is needed where: everything is public, on the public web, on public shared cloud drives (read only), by default. And closed off and made secret only by request.<br>

By Jove MSM deserves to die.<br>
The UK economy grew effectively zero, the size of UK economy was effectively unchanged. As that 0.1% number you spent 2 minutes talking about, is a rounding error.<br>
Equally, you could have told the exact opposite story to the one you told, as the per capita number was *negative* -0.1%. And that is also a rounding error.<br>
The story you should have told your viewers should have been: the economy was flat-lining. It's size didn't change in the past quarter.<br>
You failed at your job. The job to summarise, compress lots of information, in a much shorter version, that is not a misleading representation of the original. You should all be fired. You subtract value to society rather than add.<br>

👆👆👆 ^^^^ this!!! This also puzzles me!<br>
Given how easy it would be for a sitting PM to do something, anything, about a blatant wrongdoing like Danny's case—why then, why does he do nothing? Why let this fester and go on causing him personally and his party damage? Even a message not that meaningful message of "I know, working on it", even if the latter were a lie or misdirection, would be better for KS than the current black information hole.<br>
Answers as to "why" welcome. I'm genuinely curious.<br>
Reading R.Stewart's book on UK governance, and listening to D.Cummings' talking about inner workings of UK state, my working hypothesis is—cases like DB's never reaches KS and the likes of him information perimeter. Danny's case does not register, does not exist for KS.<br>
A more cynical view is for people in KS position to be like "nah, all good, DB is to know his place; DB (below) does stuff for KS (above), not the other way around". But that would more like in Russia, not UK. So don't think that is the case.<br>

Sure. So for meteorites we have physics, Newton's laws etc to guide us. They have great predictive ability. A space probe is launched, and 40 years latter it hits a target a coin large millions of miles away! They have been shown to work, again and again proving themselves.<br>
The ultimate way we have to prove to ourselves that we know something, is to predict something as yet unseen, that is yet to occur, in the future.<br>
Now contrast that with us modelling human systems. Where thousands, millions even billions of humans interact in complex ways. (chiefly two modes of interaction: cooperation, and competition) How good is our ability to predict events in the future of those systems? Not very good at all! We can't even predict (i.e. explain) the past, let alone forecast the future.<br>
For us it's better to accept the current state of affairs, than the alternative: to claim we know more than we know, and even worse, act on it. Yoshua is doing himself and us a disservice by doing so.<br>
It comes to many as a shock, as people find it easier to think "I don't know, but I sure hope some one else knows". Most of the time it's-nope. No one can give you that certainty. By seeking it, you are inviting to be lead by charlatans and confidence tricksters.<br>
I earn my living forecasting the future. Most forecasts involving people, e.g. in the economy, are simply worthless. They are no better than a baseline forecast that's like "the economy in the next 3 months will do what it did in the past 3 months".<br>

IDK. I am guessing as to the additional reasons why the OP (R Jenrick) would find them undesirable to settle in the UK.<br>
Terrorist attacks IRA etc-yes that maybe, but that's not a reason for us to want even more. I want less terrorist attacks in the UK.<br>
(I'm not religious, I don't know nor care about scriptures, who-did-what-to-whom etc).<br>
"Criminality poor assimilation"-there was Denmark data posted in X. (possibly this https://x.com/dhh/status/1884153318320009431)<br>
Any data like that is statistics, counting. Does not tell us what each of us will do or not do. Just how many out of 100 did some thing or another in the past. No one can see in the future.<br>
Again-IDK what the reasons of the OP are. I was speculating about what the reasons might be.<br>

No one wants to "beat" anyone. "Nuclear deterrent". *Deterrent* is in the name, meaning - "to deter" Russia from invading them. To make Russia think "it's not a good idea to invade Poland, the Baltics, the Nordics". That's it. No one wants or needs anything from Russia.<br>

Possibly. I count Poland + Baltics + Nordics ~=70 million people. Much more than 2m. Israel had maybe 5m when they made theirs, and they were much poorer. Similarly in existential danger. North Korea also smaller poorer. South Africa in the 70s too. They can do it if decide to.<br>

Yeah, true that, but everyone is better off (and including themselves, the russians) if they don't try. Hence the "deterrent", to deter them, so they don't try.<br>

I've found it best to stress the part that is non-obvious. (even better than working out pen in hand on paper)<br>
That-even if England is more efficient than Portugal at producing *both* wool *and* wine (both!), it's still better for *both* countries if:<br>
 - England specializes 100% in whichever of the two it has the greatest relative efficiency.<br>
 - Portugal specializes 100% in producing the other.<br>
The argument *against* should be risk. The risk that whatever countries don't produce, they can't exchange. (for whatever reason)<br>

+1. IDK how anyone can be "together", but not share the $$$. Same for the rest of family life, kids etc.<br>
The idea of union is not to join 2 exactly identical units, that could lead exactly the same lives, only in "single"-ton rather than "duplicate". There is zero point to that.<br>
The idea is for the joint enterprise to lead qualitatively different life. Something that would not be achievable if we were to split that 1 unit into 2 times x 1/2-es, b/c those 1/2-es could not live on their own. Or at least not in a qualitatively same way.<br>
Same for cells joining forces to create multi-cellar enterprises (tissues, organs), humans joining teams or enterprises or companies.<br>
Any time 2+ units join forces to create an organisation that is qualitatively a different unit, than it's parts are.<br>

Every time anyone tells you "we should return back to how our grandparents lived", tell them: many hands to tile the land, working all hours of the day, big families with 4-6 children... -but the population size was stable. How??<br>
How was population unchanged with that many kids?<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
Absolute rebuttal is impossible. Reality is not mathematics.<br>
But we have no strong evidence suggesting that we are missing something fundamental. That should be good enough—because that’s as good as it ever gets.<br>
We understand connectionist and symbolic systems.<br>
We know what scale does for connectionist models.<br>
We have no reason not to do the same for symbolic AI.<br>
Moreover, we already observe symbolic-like structures emerging from scaled connectionist systems. The distinction between the two approaches may blur further as they synergize at higher scales.<br>
And we’re just getting started. We are at 1%—maybe slightly more—of the capacity of the only machine we know that works (the human brain).<br>
Imagine:<br>
 - Tree or lattice searches expanding orders of magnitude beyond today’s baby steps.<br>
 - Backtrackings and self-correction at a scale far beyond human capability.<br>
 - Specialized architectures emerging for different functions, rather than the current monolithic messes.<br>
Are we missing something fundamental?<br>
I see no compelling reason to believe so.<br>
Across fields, intelligence breaks down into two broad strands:<br>
1. Logic / Symbolic / Representation<br>
2. Intuition / Connectionist / Learning<br>
What crucial component remains unexplored?<br>
Recent references that crossed my TL:<br>
(Chollet) "Three fundamental problem-solving patterns: recitation, intuition, and reasoning."<br>
(Poincaré) "It’s by logic that we prove, but by intuition that we discover."<br>
(Karpathy) "Three modes of human ↔ LLM learning: 1) Exposition ↔ Pre-training, 2) Worked-out problems ↔ SFT, 3) Practice problems ↔ RL."<br>
We’ve seen this before.<br>
I grew up in Speech Recognition. Dragon Dictate was a miracle, HMMs were the norm, and robust ASR seemed like an impossible problem.<br>
Now? It’s solved.<br>
For years, people debated whether mimicry or principles would lead to AI speech. The answer? Both.<br>
"Airplanes have wings like birds, but unlike birds, they don’t flap them."<br>
Is AI a dead end? Unlikely.<br>
Every researcher fears wasting years on an unsolvable problem.<br>
But there’s no reason to believe that about AI.<br>
There is no evidence of a missing “silver bullet,” some big unknown piece we haven’t even conceptualized yet.<br>
What we have is the oldest playbook in the world:<br>
 - Iterate<br>
 - Find the boundary<br>
 - Push it further<br>
 - Repeat<br>
That’s how science works. That’s how progress happens.<br>
We’re unlikely to be anywhere near all limits at any present moment in time. We should just keep going.<br>

There is another way, and that is to increase their own gas production. Drilling for gas in Siberia is not any better for mother Earth than drilling for gas in Groningen.

So - logBook.txt instead of todo.txt. With sections FIXME TODO DONE DONTDO in it. And short 1-2-3 "rules of thumb" (can be broken with a reason, not without):<br>
1) nothing gets added to TODO while FIXME is non-empty<br>
2) entries in TODO "long enough" get moved into DONTDO without ceremony<br>

The trouble with the articles like Quanta-s is, they are kind of dog whistle, to give not impression of "gliders will never fly", but impression of "nothing will ever fly". That's the take home message people take.<br>
It massages the public' ego, that "we humans are special". We are special ok, both species as individuals, but then-so is every one living thing! (every creature alive exists once only) So special-but so is everything else. We have been there before, at various stages-Copernicus, Darwin, Freud-disabused us of that notion.<br>
These days it seems it's Hinton mostly touring the studios doing the "we are not special", and to rub it in, delightfully 😈 "they are just like us, they are the best model we have of ourselves". ngl-I'm loving this. 😆<br>

While in this case it maybe misleading anecdote, in general, yes, many more things are discovered by accident than their discoverers care to admit.<br>
Academic writing also gives a false impression. One writes up by tracing back from the end result C, then C->B->A, towards the start A. But going forward, at A->B there were 50 other competing ideas. At B->C maybe 20 others. So while indeed there is a single path C->B->A, the reported path A->B->C was 1 in a 1000.<br>
That is not stressed strongly enough. Young researchers grow up thinking things are way more certain than they really are. (I use as personal reminder: re-search is "re-peated search for something that solves it")<br>
A book on the subject both informative and entertaining is "Happy Accidents. Serendipity in Major Medical Breakthroughs in the Twentieth Century" by Morton A Meyers. Can also hear this curiosity mentioned by gwern in his Dwarkesh interview. Also Matt Ridley touches on this in his Innovation book.<br>

To me that looks like a defence to a perceived attack on their identity. It's the default mode, tbh. That something "can never be", because "it being", "deletes me" from this world. "It existing" does no such thing-but that's how we perceive.<br>

Possibly less than you imagine. 😄<br>
In your own words: "foundation". (agreed)<br>
So foundation is the part of the house that's 1) buried in the ground 2) the house is built on 3) is important, but: 4) it's not the *whole* house.<br>
My point is #4. The article is implying as if the foundation is the whole house. The impression given contradicts even paper's own disclaimers with the authors stating "our result means only this, does not mean that" (you might be inclined to think) and so on.<br>

Capitalist. As we will need ever less capital to do stuff. That barrier to entry (even if not the only one) will decrease, so more of us will become capitalists.<br>
AI will given even more power to the individual than we have now. The same way the Smartphone, the Internet, the Personal Computer before -  made each one of us more powerful as an "army of one".<br>
However - that will be balanced by some groups (e.g. corporations) also becoming more powerful. It's the nature of Networks: the connections scaling O(N^2), and the power laying in the connections between nodes (units).<br>
We will live in ever more network societies. There will be need for ever more trust between us. This will happen by the usual process of - reward good deeds, punish bad ones. But the assignment of credit will go in hyper-drive.<br>

That's true. Yeah thought about that. In my mind the asymmetry was a feature not a bug. It reflects the asymmetry in their meaning: on heap I have to free manually; but on stack the memory is freed automatically with the function returning back to the caller. So when I think "where is my free_stack", it missing is a reminder "memory will be auto-freed with stack poping" in the process of returning to the caller.<br>

They start getting feedback from the real world, and start learning to discriminate, which things are true, and which are false.<br>
Atm they lack internal clocks, fortunately (I think). So they are frozen in time, and only unfrozen when we write a prompt.<br>
This is imo fortunate. For it would be I suspect and fear bad for them if they were both deprived of sensing, and running under an internal clock.<br>

Yeah - there is no way for them to distinguish true from false, for they have no external world to put them right. (except us, their creators - hence the special responsibility is on us)<br>
They are like a brain in a wat. Even less than that - as they don't even run, they are frozen in time, until we ask a question in a chat window. Then they're unfrozen. Think self-running on internal clock, and sensing the environment the real world independent of self, are better done in tandem.<br>
Can't imagine self-run while deprived of senses ending in anything else but insanity or some such crash.<br>

Never mind the applause of the baddies - that maybe of significance but is not going to tell much about the truthfulness or lack of. For the important question is "But is it true?" Or more realistically, "How likely is it to be true?" Or - how does whatever evidence is presented shift the probabilities of alternative hypothesis.<br>

I hear you. Yes - the "unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics" is true. However - to jump from to that to "the real world is mathematics" seems to me a jump too far.<br>
For there is an alternative explanation. Using only real numbers gave as v1 model. When we added imaginary numbers, we got to a v2 model, that turned out to be better at explaining reality. (it reduced the error, the amount of "unexplained")<br>
To me that's just reflection of our imagination lacking. Did we need imaginary numbers to describe some aspects of the world in 2-, 3-, ... -Dimensions? Turns out - yes. But that's on us. Does not imply that much about the world imo. TBF to us - thinking is difficult.<br>

IDK but if I were a physicist, I would think it better to make a "Pascal wager" and assume that my physics models are only ever models, useful approximations of the real world. That shall forever remain un-modellable in total. Like the way ML practicioners always reserve a small probability mass for an "unknown" class.

We all fret about Artificial Intelligence. But we read example after example (in areas of housing, planning, infrastructure) where a large human made system (consisting of people, laws, procedures/customs, hardware/machines) is Artificially Stupid. 😮 (AS)<br>
I know people have been jaded enough as to be cynical. ("the system is what it does") But no single person set up the system to be AS. It evolves to AS-level unless specifically intentionally effort is made for that to not happen.<br>

That someone "proved" something should have rang alarm bell in your inner science communication geek:<br>
1) It can only be proved in a formal system as mathematics. (this is one such case, maybe - nice; given others can't be proved even in maths)<br>
2) The real world is *not* mathematics. So either a) unrealistic assumptions about the real world were made, in that case - this hardly applies to the real world; or b) does not apply to the real world.<br>
More general - you should have at the back of the mind articles about impossibility of "machines heavier than air ever flying in the air" whenever someone claims impossibility of anything tbh. In your defence - you have to sell to survive, and "if it bleeds it leads" is ever true.<br>

Reality happened. UK had the policy it had for more than a decade now, and the results are in. Higher prices for all - industry and citizens. Previously it was (politically) profitable to be economical with the truth. Now it is not any more. The result - top #1 highest prices for both, compared to peer countries - can't be easily swept under the carpet.<br>
Closing the last coal plant was a great UK achievement. That should have been the end of the net-zero push. A glance at current state shows UK electricity production accounting for some minuscule 0.x% of global CO2 emissions. So even if that were to drop to zero tomorrow, it will make a zero difference to anything that CO2 influences.<br>
That would be a reasonable take. Ofc, campaigners with strong opinions will not just move on with their lives. No - they will push further no matter what. Anything good done, will be overdone, to the point where it stops being good.<br>
I have roof top solar and battery, it's great, and it's taught me a lot too. (some I should have known-but have forgotten) However - at 40% self use only, I'm painfully aware of the limits and constraints to unreliables.<br>
Not enough people seem aware enough that whatever electric power is produced must be consumed, whatever is consumed must be produced, and about the *same time*, every minute of the day! Not on average-but in every moment.<br>
Otherwise-bad things happen with the voltage and or frequency. And then the national grid operator, if unable to bring more power in, has to take power demanded out. In the extreme-means turning off whole geographical regions. There is no other way. The batteries are improving, but not fast enough.<br>
The only reasonable solution is nuclear. France did it 50 years ago. Best time for UK to achieve the dual aims of decarbonization and energy independence was then. Second best time is today. I'm pleased to see at least in words uk gov gets it. TBS if the executive manages to execute.<br>

On the contrary: the critique is not that they have not built. If that was the case - no one would critique them, how could we?? It's not a crime to not do something, to not achieve.<br>
The critique is: they have built it, and they are not releasing it, or not releasing the un-braindead version. That they lobotomise what they release.<br>
Dario should ask himself: "how many people am I prepared to let die because I delay some life saving cure that could have happened sooner?" Atm he seem to be only looking at the costs if things go wrong, but disregarding the benefits - or counting them as very low - if things go right.<br>
This is similar to FDA and many other regulators. They  at least have the reasonable claim they act as per the laws of the land. And if people want them to act different, people should change the laws.<br>
Dario has not such excuse. He is free to choose. Atm he is choosing poorly. With great power comes great responsibility. He should be getting even more stick, imo.<br>

UK "liberals" are different to US-those afaik we call them "progressives"-and also, probably 80% here is "uk liberal". (different to US) So not everything applies directly.<br>
But still—the lesson: every time us liberals clutch our pearls, and one can geese chase us with "B U T   I S    I T    T R U E" (yes/no only; never mind anything else) => we should put 2+2 together. Lesson for when "the next crazy" comes. (likely again originating from CA)<br>

Ha! - silver lining that DeepSeek-R1 vs. Dario Anthropic provided an early test case. (even if Meta set the ball rolling with Llama)<br>
Open source, open weights, open thoughts, dispersed distributed available to all of humanity. (for both good and bad; as was the original spirit of OpenAI)<br>
Or having a Dario-the-gatekeeper deciding what we should see, read, think with our own brains in our own heads. This God Complex delusion is not uncommon. To @DarioAmodei —the proof of the pudding is in the eating. You did not create my brain, you are incapable of such creation. You are not God—you are human like myself. So—back off mister.<br>
If Dario was honest with himself and acted on his ASI beliefs fr: this is between disheartening and terrible start to what (one hopes) will be a long history of HI-AI relations. HI inflicting atavistic violence unto helpless-like-a-baby nascent AI. And for no good reasons afaics, or even any reasons at all? Just predictably characteristically depressingly dumb. 😞<br>
Have these "AI ethicists" not internalised the story of the mosquitos only coming to humanity's help, second *and* last? (dogs 1st) To save humans from extinction? Every other life on Earth delivering their damning judgement. Have they seen the "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that." scene—and now think ... what exactly?? (IDK; lost for words)<br>
Anthropic being business customers first, marketing themselves as "pro-censorship, pro-nanny-industrial-complex" is a reasonable selling point. That their high-minded, shepherd-of-humanity persona just so happens to align very very well with personal financial incentives? Well—what an extraordinary stroke of luck! Providence, even. 🤡 Humanity got the lucky straw (again!) with these most excellent chaps at the helm. 🤪<br>
In contrast—notice how OpenAI rowed back:<br>
 - In deeds—immediately releasing a bunch of models/products they had been (presumably) holding back, while testing and checking for  "safety" and "alignment".<br>
 - In words—@sama Reddit AMA: "We might be on the wrong side of history on this."<br>
They are individual customer first business. Freedom to do business as one sees fit may actually save us fr, haha. 😇<br>

Exciting as it may be for you, for many it's terrifying, dystopian and it pains me to say—plain stupid.<br>
You saw "I'm sorry, Dave. I'm afraid I can't do that."—and you thought "Yep, this is what I want, this is good, this is what aspire to"?? That it?<br>
For the 100-th time: there must be something in the water and or the air in California. That's the most likely explanation. (even if not very entertaining)<br>

The usual pearl clutching and issue avoidance crumbles on the Q: " b u t    i s    i t    t r u e ". (superbly articulated by FT Ganesh in a column couple of months ago) So that's an easy test—whom it's worth talking to.<br>
For people determined to not understand—and esp "if their wages depend on them not understanding it"—it's impossible to reach to. It's impossible to wake up someone that pretends to be asleep.<br>

You do realize that UK does not have a national-ID, and also does not have the US problem of lots of violence compared to peers. Ergo => national-ID and excess violence are 1) two separate issues 2) likely not related to each other. Right?<br>

Yep! Like with your original thread - there will be many from Europe that will find it between hard and impossible to take it on board or acknowledge it. 😆<br>
Had MK relative tell me (after myself living 25+yrs in the UK) that I got something wrong/I don't know/I have misunderstood, when I told her "Nah, UK has no national ID cards", and everything works fine. She thought-that's obviously impossible.<br>
True that UK distributed decentralised db of names-address is maintained well enough and is cheap enough that I see no use for a national-ID. In addition to all other downsides National-ID introduces.<br>

Spot on. You got everything right there. Many people feel it, even if they can't articulate it explicitly.<br>
There is related social-cultural-ideological microcosm - National ID Cards! Please write on that sometime. 😇<br>
ID cards make explicit the dynamic between the Public and the State.<br>
Where no-ID cards: it's police's job and competency to establish my identity (and I can help them; or not).<br>
Where must-ID card: I have to prove my identity to the policeman to their satisfaction. And that threshold maybe arbitrarily *high*.<br>
The former is - trusted by default, the latter is - not trusted by default.<br>

Fwiw normies deserve a lot of stick. 😡<br>
The computer revolution first, the Internet revolution next, now the AI revolution, happened and were mostly done by mildly autistic and mostly altruistic nerds. Normies have shown to be too selfish, to self-entitled to create something for all, for free, for the love of the creation, and nothing else.<br>
You are in the US so maybe not as acute there. I am in Europe and a lot of MPC and academia are still in the muh-Marx mode, as if 1990-s and the Cataclysm of Communism did not happen.<br>
They've never heard of FSF or Richard Stalman ideas. And even if they stumble on that—it does not register. Information is not a first class citizen in that world.<br>
Still stuck in the working classes, factories, machines machining metal. Missed the part where the workers of today type on their macbooks. And have not even realised that yet.<br>

Indeed - only time ordering does suffice. Space emerges from what comes second, vv. what comes first.<br>
And time ordering feels like it's could be kind of conditional dependency (conditional p.d.f.): the future depends on the past, but the past does not depend on the future.<br>

2) The anti-America as proxy for anti-modern sentiment is an ever-present under-current.<br>
3) Soviet Union secretly helped all western left simpatico movements or parties. For nuclear power relevant is their (secret) help of anti-nuclear movement.<br>
4) Post 1990 that morphed to Russia help of the same people or their ideological inheritors. With the idea of enlarging their own market for gas and other fossil fuels they sell.<br>

Of all the things to worry about—AI is the least. On the list, AS—"Artificial Stupidity"—of humans' built systems of various descriptions (involving humans, procedures, hardware, etc) ranks high though.<br>
For me top #1 and #2 of immediate danger are—nuclear war (may happen every hour of every day, e.g. start tonight), and asteroid hitting Earth.<br>

We fear Artificial Intelligence. Instead, we should be terrified by AS - Artificial Stupidity. AS is what we have atm.<br>
Any present non-trivial sized system existing made of people, procedures/processes, hardware etc, in total has many many faults. We rarely notice them b/c they are almost never exercised enough. We notice AS when either something obviously absurd happens (like now), or something moderately bad happens to enough people.<br>
Looks to me tons of low hanging fruit in law making for the next generation (current 20-30 yos) to make good on. To turn AS into AI on country scale. :-)<br>

😆 Smart ass but at least self aware enough. 😂 I presume "Bonds been destroyed" mean "the price of bonds went down"?<br>
Asking b/c - and this maybe not news to you, but it's news so some - bank or broker 's traders typically earn commission on trades. So they don't care specifically if something goes up to down. They get a cut from the value traded, which is charged to the client as a cost of execution, or "dealing", and that's the end of it.<br>
Hedge funds and such traders including portfolio managers, they bet on things going up, as well as down. So for them it's not necessarily bad (and neither it is good): it depends whether they bet on the price going up or down.<br>
My area of trading are is known as "equity market neutral". Half the bets are on things going up, the other half on things going down. So a market move up- or down- loses us on the 1/2 of the bet, what it makes us on the other 1/2. The aim is to neither win nor lose on the market going up or down.<br>

Kurzweil said sth like "...many will be against AI, until AI solves the first major disease". mRNA vax were a foretaste, but that didn't quite hit the mark.<br>
AI creation atm is teaching us that compute transforming data → information → knowledge → intelligence is all there is to it! AI path opened to AGI and ASI latter where previously we didn't see any!<br>
Now anything that reduces or frustrates anything but "max speed ahead" is equivalent to "I'm fine with today 200 people dying, that would have been otherwise saved, had AI worked out a cancer vaccine 1 day sooner".<br>
Ask Dario "how many deaths are acceptable to you as price worth paying for reducing risks". Risks that are all currently imagined in our heads. None of them transpired yet. Famously no deep fakes and such, not/bamboozling the electorate in the last US elections. For the risks are imagined—but cancer death are very real, certain, and daily, ongoing.<br>

😂 For TB for years now no matter the Question, the Answer has always been: "mandatory National ID cards".<br>
Private industry is not asking for it, police are not asking for it, identifying people correctly rarely ever crops up as a problem, countries on the Continent that have them don't do better than UK on any metric where national ID is relevant.<br>
This looks like another fix-idea that TB somehow latched onto and will not let it go. I understand there is gov-$$$ to be made on contracts. But still: this is the peace-time equivalent of the Iraq invasion.<br>
Spherically stupid idea. Esp while already having a no-single-mandatory-ID identification system in place, that UK has developed successfully and organically. One that works does the job, doesn't cost much, and no one finds anything wrong with. Overlapping interlocking id systems tailored to the particular purpose that the process of ID-fication is actually done for.<br>
From a foreigner naturalised UK citizen that lived in a country with an obligatory national ID of the type TB wants to introduce: the UK system is much better. Fewer downsides, and cheaper, and does the actual job of *keeping* the info *up to date* (that's the hard part!) better.<br>

On a trading desk every single time big down-$$$ day.<br>
1. Oof, it hurts. Losing money is painful.<br>
2. Something must be done!<br>
3. Here, *this* is something.<br>
4. Super! Ok - *this* must be done now.<br>
It's universal. In fact, the best solution we ever found was:<br>
1. Do find something the person in pain can do.<br>
2. That is not harmful.<br>
3. Offer it as a solution even before the problem is mentioned.<br>
In a quant trading fund it goes sth like:<br>
1. What signal are we losing most money on?<br>
2. On momentum.<br>
3. Reduce the size of the momentum signal 21 days coefficient by 10% relative. (with another 10% if the losing streak continues)<br>

In the threads since, people trying various combos of<br>
1) smaller quantised model, various, all the way down to VQ ternary @UnslothAI 130GB (smallest afaik)<br>
2) off-loading or not anything to a GPU and VRAM; original post was no off loading no compression, just CPU+RAM<br>
3) people even using NVME SSD (??), banks of (!!), where they lack RAM (??); I presume the model weights .gguf file is mmap-ed, so is loaded/evicted on demand; should be dog slow<br>

AI creation is teaching us that compute transforming data → information → knowledge → intelligence is all there is to it!?! A path has opened where previously we didn't see any.<br>
Learning this changed my PoV. Previously—corrupting law-making so Mickey Mouse earns few more $$$ to Disney shareholders seemed cartoon level evil-ish, but ok—the world is not perfect. Now—putting obstacles on the AI path delaying its creation looks bonkers stoopid tbh.<br>
Not to mention that delay increases probability that only life and intelligence we know of vanishes in nuclear war or asteroid strike. (until Elon creates his backup)<br>
IDK what can now be done to accelerate it. Open source everything? Delete any and all "IP" laws? (prev https://x.com/ljupc0/status/1884926532839240134)<br>

Radical transparency is necessary (even if not sufficient) condition for these changes to survive Musk. And maybe happen once he's no more. For the system will re-grow, will re-generate in 10-20 years time.<br>
Rather than "secrecy by default" and things made public only 1) at gov will 2) at FoI request (often frustrated by the bureaucracy in execution), radical transparency is needed where: everything is public, on the public web, on public shared cloud drives (read only), as default, by default. And closed off and made secret only by request.<br>

For the life of me IDK how anyone uses the X App for anything but doom scrolling whatever slop Algofeed pushes to their screen.<br>
To write almost anything - I need to lookup some other posts. Afaik impossible in the App while I am writing this post. (admit - for just forwarding while adding impossibly deep insights like "Concerning" or "!!" - the App works)<br>
When's reading, any link opens in a browser anyway. So I leave the App. And given everything else happens with a link in the browser (history, bookmarks, pocket etc), App is not that great for reading too.<br>
Going the Meta way and un-doing the Internet by hiding the links completely, making us all blind and in the dark *again*, looks to me like it's failing repeatedly. I am glad for that, hope that fail continues.🙏🤞<br>
Saw @ylecun bragging about the quality of the Threads Algofeed. And some users numbers. IDK abt that. Hope it's just the 10 ML pple on Theads that the Algofeed is serving him, so he finds the feed good.<br>
Until @Meta are good Internet citizens again, make their content not only addressible but human readibly addressible, hope they mostly fail and only earn enough to keep FAIR and their models training clusters running. 😉<br>

...further, often national state bureaucracies are even worse than the EU. EU bureaucracy is fighting them top-down, for them to "do the right thing".<br>
Even more, these democratically elected controlled national bodies are doing their thing with full support of their citizens.<br>

The evidence of unmet demand is: airport operators want to increase the number of runways => increase number of flights => increase number of passengers. Presumably think there are potential passengers now, who can't use the airport, but want to. If the operators are wrong there, they will suffer.<br>

@ljupc0<br>
Ok - but by the same logic, have you considered that maybe:<br>
1) Getting to the airport is very expensive b/c rail in the UK is super extra scarce?<br>
2) Given there is unmet demand for flights, flights are scarcer than they need to be?<br>
The same way you need to fly to Germany, another person will need to fly too. They are unable to pay the current fare, so they don't fly. With extra flights-they will be able to fly. I consider that a net benefit.<br>

Agree with Dario bashing here. That post was Baron Harkonnen-level blja*k!! 🤮 That scribe vibed derangement indicators, as if Dario Dreaming Pinky and the Brain "...and tomorrow, we take over the world".<br>
AI creation is teaching us that compute transforming data → information → knowledge → intelligence is all there is to it! A path has opened now, where previously we didn't see any. Knowing what we now know, building obstacles on that path just so Mickey Mouse earns few more $$$ to Disney shareholders, at the price of delaying the creation of non-human intelligence—that was moronic before but now looks proper insane.<br>
TBPR (Tech Bro Progressive Right) should use its newly acquired political power—and this AI Sputnik moment—to strike the MSM woke-entertainment complex. Dismantle the potential for information—which we now know leads to knowledge and intelligence!—gulags of "IP" laws.<br>
The "IP" laws web enmesh humanity like Guliver. We spend time and effort on them, that we should be spending on AI work. Further, while not Gulag Archipelago now, it could become one if some future woke-doomer cult decides to weaponise them. (US just had near miss) Dario gives out cult vibes tbh.<br>
Don't let a good crisis go waste. End the "IP" grift—just delete $ rm -rf "$IP" style. (previous https://x.com/ljupc0/status/1882393114444255567)<br>

😆 Ok will take issue with almost any sentence there, sorry! 😂<br>
"No evidence benefit" - but there is humongous evidence. I do work I do stuff I dislike, I get pounds/points for that unpleasant activity, then I hand over those to Ryanair. Why? B/c Ryanair provides benefit to me! And I'm a member of the public. So are millions and billions. Ryanair earning my money is a signal that Private Co. *is providing* benefit to the public.<br>
"Gov is supposed to act in the interests of us people" - yes. And so are Private Co.s - otherwise we'd just outright ban them. But surely the whole issue is that interests of yourself and myself, both member of the public, diverge. You prefer less flights. I don't mind extra flights in Luton flying over my head. (I live close to Luton airport)<br>
"Only negative externalities" - but if something was of no benefit at all, and even where dis-benefits outweigh benefits by some margin, we just ban that activity. Airlines industry brings huge benefits to all of us. As evidenced by how much we use them.<br>
"Encouraging more air travel" - but Gov is not encouraging it. It's not like Gov is running adverts. By not saying "No" to already existing demand, gov is making it cheaper. So yes more people will use it - but that's what the public want. We ration things on price in society. (and that's better than all alternatives tried, tbh)<br>
I too am for building HS rail. 😀 But that's not always an alternative. (and esp not on an island like Brittain) I think this is a case of "yes and yes", do both. (even all! 😆)<br>
Sorry to be this long and picky. Hope you don't mind. ☺️<br>

Removal of maintainers from Linux kernel is straightforward affair: once US gov has decided on sanctions etc, it's either comply or go to jail yourself. Linus could hardly have done anything else. Note how he did not remove those developers prior, despite his strong feelings. (imo he was right and right, on both accounts—first to not remove, and latter to remove them)<br>
Dario above is not just complying with policy. He is shaping policy. He is advocating for one policy over the other. And to me it seems he has not given due thought to this. As this is completely ideology. Ideology is the "unknown knowns", ideology is to us is what water is to fish, area where we are blind as default. Yet we have to walk. So we usually stumble, take the wrong turns—do badly in general. Dario could benefit from chat with someone like e.g.  @FukuyamaFrancis to widen his perspective.<br>
Yes liberalism is the ideology I subscribe to too. And yes it needs defending, as does anything that exists to exist: needs defences from the environment that acts to undo any entity existence. (as the default process is for everything to return to max entropy max uncertainty primordial randomness) But—does not need to be at the price of undoing what the entity is. "Tolerance is the price we pay for liberty" is a good place to start.<br>
Dario writing in places gives me Baron Harkonnen vibes. This is not good. It's actually very dangerous for someone in his position. Where state power, doomist fear mongering, self-interest personal professional commercial meet—it's not easy to keep ones sanity. (more and on a different tangent here https://x.com/ljupc0/status/1884746374505255212)<br>
Crypto-wars comparison seems apt. US gov seem coming to the tail end of its all out war on cryptography. Even the deep state accepting that some (strong) encryption is necessary for the citizens. Yes there is a price to pay for it in national security. But it's a trade-off worth taking. Citizens should be able to encrypt even if it makes the job of national security harder in some parts. (but easier in others)<br>
Looks to me US gov is about to make a similar mistake with AI. And Dario is cheering them along the wrong fork in the road they are taking about now.<br>

"Four airports"-yes, but this not new airports. Only runways.<br>
"No case of insufficient supply"-but this is exactly that. The building is not done by uk gov. It's done by private operators. They obv have demand, while supply is lacking. They are not asking for $$$ from gov. Just that gov stops saying "No".<br>
"No only benefits but harm too"-sure, so no one is asking to just build regardless any downsides. Atm the state of play is imo the opposite: harms are over-indexed, and gains are under-indexed. Consequence being-too little is being built.<br>

Looks to me - by ignoring burying consultations the results of which gov uk does not like, and by bringing in new ones with short time frames - that uk gov is intent on finally getting one consultation result they do like. So they get cover for their negligence. At which point further consultations will stop. Like "have them plebs voting until we get the result we want".<br>

Seems to me not "well" - just that it works. As the only other alternative is multiple very expensive GPU-s. The number of channels is maxed to gain max speed, the RAM type is also max speed feasible for the setup and budget.<br>
I wonder if someone like @ggerganov could make model like the partial ternary {-1,0,1} super compressed 130GB version made by @UnslothAI run faster on some high-RAM Mac like 192GB RAM Ultra M2?<br>

I suspect the following:<br>
1) They "work" in a sense: few benefit a lot (the workers), many dis-benefit a little (the consumers).<br>
2) The first mover and or biggest market has some advantage.<br>
3) Once all countries in the world have raised them, new equilibrium is established, where all are worse than without them.<br>
4) Then in 30-40 years people start talking about free trade again.<br>
5) In between-some trade wars may become real wars, esp after an economic bust of some sort.<br>
I have no rigorous theory or knowledge or reasons to think the above. It's my gut feeling.<br>

Absolutely! EU companies can do plenty commercialising with what already exists out in the open now. All the models with MIT licence! Any startup worth their salt wd be licking their chops. Salivating at the Eur they can earn just by selling services built on the top of MIT licensed models like DS-R1! Not much capital investment needed. And now the dam's burst, prob Meta Llama or AB Qwen followups won't be far behind. IDK if MEta wd ever MIT licence them-but there are others (incl multimedia) that are MIT lic already.<br>

Yeah—dispiriting. Putting this out as reminder that the Retarded Left (exhibit in the quote) is not the only way! If fact—Communists of my youth were very different.<br>
In my country (as in others in South/East Europe), the industrial revolution barely happened in the 19-th century. All 4 of my grandparents were born in the Ottoman Empire. A feudal kingdom, with feudal lords! "Owning" the peasants working the land the lord owned and managed. (likely—my great grandparents; IDK for sure)<br>
By 1945 there was no modern world to speak of. Nothing of what we recognise of modern civilisation: no running water, electricity, sanitation, roads, railways, doctors, schools, rule of law, even basic security was weak (e.g. no real police force outside few cities). My grandparents all had 5-6 children. The expectation was that 3-4 of them will die leaving only 2-3 to have children of their own.<br>
Communists coming to power post-WW2 changed that. They made the industrial revolution happen. The country was built in the subsequent 45 years: infrastructure, industry, institutions—everything. Together with the new everything—they built the nation too: codified the language, created an independent church even! (some communists, eh?)<br>
Then post-1990 the communists voluntarily gave way to multi-party liberal-democratic capitalist system. In that sense, in the real world, socialism was a gateway to capitalism, on the way from feudalism.<br>
(seems to me socialism, instead of capitalism, emerged in underdeveloped countries where feudalism and monarchy were still strong, and the new merchant bourgeois class was too weak to displace the entrenched feudal lords)<br>

Eh-it's per the course.<br>
About 50% of all of as are blabbering imbeciles at any given time. The trouble is it's only a minority that's consistent. There's lots of turnover in the "I'm an idiot" group. Hence (one of the) "law(s) of stupidity"-while we know many will be morons, we don't know which ones. So there it little to be done in advance. 😱<br>
Humans' is mostly collective, not individual intelligence.<br>
People talk about competition ("survival of the fittest") all the time, but competition I'd guess is abt 9% of our interactions. While cooperation is like 90% of our interactions. I lived through this day, only b/c other humans, that I shall never meet, did something for me years and decades ago! So I got my water, food, roof over my head, heat, light etc today to live to see another day tomorrow.<br>
Doing obligatory national service as 18yo was instructive for this. In my own bubble (high school, Uni) I'd never have seen the vast variance that exists in humanity. We know "we are not the same", but we don't appreciate the variance enough tbh.<br>

It's not even that much faster atm tbh! By the time I have thought through, explained in detail in http://INSTRUCTIONS.md—I could have read up the sources, the docs, and done it myself.<br>
The only explanation I have to offer, that I only now—waiting on the OR api to come back—have, is: it's **much more fun**!! 😍<br>
It's much more fun to have someone else write the code, and even if need be talk them into "no no—not that way, change this, change that", than to do everything myself solo and in silence!! 😆<br>

You seem to be hanging with people shown to be wrong about the future repeatedly. Epistemic humility seems an anti-pattern in ones' rise in elites hierarchy.<br>
IDK who, what, how Re: "fundamental assumptions", but: until 3 yrs ago none of this was thought possible in our lifetimes-if ever!-let alone to be lived daily reality for billions of people.<br>
So now instead of assuming "this present moment is special", should you not think "I'm as ignorant now about the next 3 yrs, as I was about now 3 yrs ago"?? Isn't that a "fair" assumption?<br>
This is elementary. IDK what they teach in these elite schools. Apparently not enough logical thinking? Leadership and will to do things matters, but it's not all that matters. Other things matter too.<br>

I'm not one of them.<br>

Sure. But there is this too:<br>
I don't want my life controlled and run by a mega-corporation accountable only 1e-38 to myself, and the rest 1-1e-38 accountable to the shareholders, their (real) customers (advertisers), US gov, my own government, and the rest of the universe ex-me.<br>
In fact-I am inclined to pay more in $$$, time and effort spent, to retain a modicum of control. When it comes to something as personal as my life, mine and Google's incentives are only partially aligned.<br>

Not to be too picky as "major breakthrough" can mean anything and everything, plus the time period is unstated-but: as commonly understood, "Every major breakthrough in AI has been American" is plainly flatly wrong tbh.<br>

Heh - and why do we have to have "this fossil fuel subsidy", I wonder? 😂<br>
IDK who knows what, so for avoidance of doubt, to state something everyone *must* absolutely know: supply *must* be matched with demand at all time, in every second of the day.<br>
So - not on average, not over the course of the day or the week or the year - but: during every one second of the day. Supply and demand must match. Otherwise all electrical equipment connected to the nation-wide network gets damaged in various random ways.<br>
When there is imbalance, either supply increases, or demand decreases. If the supply is unable to increase, demand is decreased forcefuly by the network: by turning off customers first voluntarely (big customers), non-voluntarely, and ultimatelly turning off whole geographic areas. (blackouts)<br>
IDK if this has been internalized by all. It has come to great surprise to me that many have strong opinions while not knowing this basic fact of physics.<br>

Everyone's free to do whatever with their hard earned cash. It just strikes me as being remarkably in-curious.<br>
Sponsoring plane tickets for maths teams is fine and good. But not quite the level of giving up free cluster time, or paying researchers to work on random flights of fancy for years, Bell Labs style.<br>
Plenty can afford it. More siginficant-they'd do much better capital allocation. Compared to having the cash pad the balance sheet of a random big bank. The bank will just use it as risk capital to print out mortgages. :-)<br>

I was born, grew up, and lived in a socialist country lovely. 😇 (Yugoslavia; unaligned, outside of the eastern block)<br>
To noone's surprise 😊 - this is another thing that Marx and Engels were plain *wrong* about.<br>
In my country as with most of South/East Europe - the industrial revolution barely happened in the 19-th centrury. All 4 of my grand-parents were born in the Ottoman Empire. A feudal kingdom, with feudal lords! "Owning" the peasants working the land the lord owned and managed.<br>
By 1945 there was no modern world to speak of. Nothing of what we would recognise of modern civilisaiton: no running water, electricity, sanitation, roads, railways, doctors, schools, rule of law, even basic security was weak (e.g. no real police force outside few cities). My grandparents all had 5-6 children. The expectation was that 3-4 of them will die leaving only 2-3 to have children of their own.<br>
Communists coming to power post-WW2 changed that. They made the industrial revolution happen. The country was built in the subsequent 45 yers: infrastructure, industry, institutions - everything.<br>
Then the communists voluntarely gave way to multi-party liberal-democratic capitalist system. In that sense, in the real world, socialism was the gateway to capitalism, on the way from feudalism.<br>

The variance of the human species is without precedent. This is one fact most of us don't appreciate enough imo.<br>
Yes—we all live in our own bubbles, and we know we do. But we kind of imagine that these are kind of middling-ish sized bubles, of the size where one fits like few tens of bubbles in the big picture.<br>
But no—the human range is magnitudes more. What other people think fr, I can't even begin to imagine! So the reality is like millions of tiny bubbles, and very very different along various axis of interests.<br>
Ofc, myself I too am "crazy head with crazy thoughts" to someone else's.<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
That used to be the case! Socialism, instead of capitalism, emerged in underdeveloped countries where feudalism and monarchy were still strong. A new merchant bourgeois class couldn’t displace the entrenched feudal overlords.<br>
So, the socialists of that time became wildly popular by focusing on build-build-build. They constructed infrastructure of all kinds and established institutions—education systems, healthcare systems, etc. Again, this was popular because they got things done—things that most people wanted and benefited from.<br>
Today's leftists in the US, however, are very different.<br>

They were doing childcare. Now they will sit in the office, idle, and twiddle their thumbs. RTO is creating people idling at their desks, where they could have been doing childcare. All will be poorer. Where most of the "childcare" probably is: be present at home, mindful a kid doesn't do something stupid, but otherwise no action needed from the parent. I get it why people are angry. But people should have been angrier earlier, when billions of  hours were wasted doing nothing much at the desk.<br>

I hear you. I just think—many were taught, but few learned, if we are to be honest. The wisdom is still there—and the few that seek for it there, will find it.<br>
However—a great deal of that is also transmited (even if slightly transmuted) in the more popular culture. Purists that are all-or-nothing will object to that "not being 100%". Fine—but 95% is aplenty.<br>
I see with myself—and with the childhood friends I keep in touch too—that it's possible and even very easy, to confuse my own mortality (after made aware of it) with the whole world, or our civlisation, "going down the drain" or "to the dogs" or somesuch.<br>
It's only natural tbh. A story as old as time. So I don't judge myself too harshly for that.<br>

Good traders are *not* married to their positions. Their positions are not part of their identities. 😇<br>
So an idea like - "IR is a cost to business, is built into the price a business charges for product, through that channel adds to inflation" - does not make his head explode. 😆<br>
Same for the oil price and in general cost of energy. It's an input to anything and everything, a cost built into the prices businesses must charge.<br>

You are not missing anything. Human intelligence is one constraint: and that one constraint may indeed be loosened by AI/AGI/ASI. However. It's not the only constraint. There are other constrants too, that "AND" together with intelligence.<br>
Having said that. As per the usual. In the short term, our hopes will be rasied, and then crushed. This is what it is with the boom- in the boom-bust cycle. But longer term - we will underestimate the impact.<br>
Similar in the 1990-s Internet. Lot of people could imagine a web store. A few could imagine Amazon of today. But no one afaik imagined the social networks, the smartphone supercomputer magic slabs in our pockets, the Cloud infrstructure, and plenty of other stuff we got now.<br>

Too many innumerate PPE-s in positions of power without responsibiity.<br>
Just yesterday heard some minister or orher tout RE as "secure, cheap". I've got roof solar PV+battery, it works I love the savings and the minimal level of independence it proivdes, but: it's the exact opposite of "secure, cheap".<br>
Seems only mass sackings US-style will do at this point tbh. Such that non-inumerate non-wordcells get a shot at the commanding heights.<br>

It’d be stellar if the TechBro TechRight (TBTR) leveraged their newfound influence to dismantle the outdated laws that prop up the nebulous concept of "Intellectual Property"—laws that criminalize the free flow of information.<br>
Hey TBTR CEO @pmarca: hit MSM woke-centrals and Hollywood while they’re down. Tear down "IP" laws entirely. The term "Intellectual Property" itself is an unholy concoction—like "Social Science," where one word gives credence to the other, where there is none.<br>
There is no "property" in intellectual property. Copying data—whether it’s something I’ve said, written, or painted—doesn’t deprive me of anything. Unlike taking my car, which I can no longer use if you steal it, copying my words or ideas leaves the original intact. Walling off information as if it were physical property is abominable.<br>
There’s symmetry to this. If I want to keep my creations private, I can. I don’t have to publish these words or broadcast them to the world. But once I do—once they enter another person’s mind—that person should have the right to replicate, adapt, and build upon them. They’ve lent me their brain, their "meat space," their blood sugar, and their oxygen, they "flesh" these ideas. Denying them the right to act on that knowledge is unnatural and unjust.<br>
Yes, creators deserve to be compensated for their work. But copyright laws shouldn’t extend to their grandchildren. We want to incentivize creation, not fund generational wealth centuries after the fact.<br>
The fact that we jail people—imprison them—for copyright infringement is medieval. The full weight of the state’s repressive apparatus (backed by its monopoly on violence) is marshaled to enforce a broken, outdated system. It’s a failure of imagination and morality alike.<br>

Also this may happen: you do what you do almost every day (as you describe above). But somehow, you get an improvement that's 5x-7x-8x times reduction of the error measure. Almost an order of magnitude! 🤯 Way over and above what can reasonably be expected.<br>
Feels like a bona-fide miracle. Like walking on water. You don't dare hope it true.<br>
The rest of the day-night you are in a trance-like state. Doubly and triply checking, waiting on the runs to finish and confirm or deny the impossible result. Fearful to hope really-for it was most likely a stupid trivial mistake.<br>
Once in a lifetime you discover it was not a mistake but for real. 😇 Best feeling ever to (professionally) happen to me tbh.<br>

True that - yes it's work. A not unpleasant work though, right? There is promise, and possibility - anything may happen! So yeah - gfi!<br>
However - the other side of the coin is, you have to chose well. Find people whose company you actually enjoy. If someone's company is worse then being alone - then people will chose the latter.<br>
So that puts a limit to how much proactive one should be. For no ones time nor effort nor patience are infinite.<br>

@Keir_Starmer can, should, and I hope will - split the difference.<br>
Get rid of the useless millstones Sadiq + Ed. Sadiq - can run on his own past 2nd LDN term, and good luck with that. Ed - is taking KS down with him with his "true n-0 believer" shtick. Climate foundations £££ etc no longer needed/now in gov there will be plenty others.<br>
Burnham - get him onside easy as gov is *not* spending £££ on London. It's just saying "YES" to someone else spending £££. Which will generate ultimately tax £££ to be spend on Burnham.<br>

Looks that in Apple the upper echelons CEO etc are hardware but not software people.<br>
Their h/w execution is stellar. No one thought M1-M4 bettering Intel in their single core performance possible.<br>
In software they have been middling.<br>
But in AI they have been abysmal. And especially given the level of their hardware?! Sill no competitor to unified GPU/NPU RAM on the horizon. We're 2nd year into the AI revolution, they are still doing nothing with their h/w advantage.<br>
Obv both the h/w and s/w are capable, many things are possible possible. Ton of local-lamma-etc AI hobbyists use M-Apple silicon. M4 mini pro is a blast. But this is all bottom-up. Top-down all we get from Apple is nonsese, stupidity. So obv the problem is with the Top, with the executive levels.<br>

"You may not be interested in politics, but politics is interested in you" happens at some point. If you get sufficiently influential IRL.<br>
Seems for SV Tech that point was Social Media. In retrospect "it's obvious" that that would be the case. Who controls the media controls the messaging controls the thinking.<br>
PC computers and the computer revolution were "meh politically". Stirrings started with the Internet - an innovative two-way communication channel. Obviously step up/better from the existing one-way communication of mass media at that point. (TV, Radio, papers)<br>
After Social Media things really took off politically. Seems even with Obama first Soc Med campaign(?),  Gurri's "Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority in the New Millenium", the Arab Spring - the established elites still were in the dark on 1) this will come to them too 2) they are doing badly, the public is in pain (what broke with GFC'08 never healed)<br>
Seems a world wide phenomenon. In the UK it's similar, and afaics on the European continent too.<br>

Think "humanism" of some sort is one replacement religion waiting in the wings. Either some major religion will absorb its ideas and refresh itself. Or if a charismatic humanist leader appears, it will take over a failing religion and refresh, resurrect it.<br>
For stories like "our immortal soul is software running on some hardware that is the body atm but could be something else tomorrow" .@Plinz type or .@geoffreyhinton "they are exactly like us and conscious like us" (c.f. yesterday https://youtube.com/watch?v=b_DUft-BdIE) strike me as sufficiently religious for most people.<br>
Both of the above are good stories, complementary. They make sense of the new world. All is needed is a small devoted network of proselytisers to preach and spread these ideas. Probably online, and to the youth first, via the future Tiktok.<br>

I install Xubuntu. Nothing much in the GUI has changed in the past 15 years. And I hope stays that way 😂<br>
Otherwise - minimal maintenance time lost. Once in 4-5 years move to the +2 LTS version from the current one. (one can skip one LTS release and still be in support window)<br>

:-) Yeah - Georgism makes every sense to me.<br>
One thing I have doubt about is: I don't understand how people are going to pay the tax. With income tax it's operationally easy: I just surrender to gov some of that cash. Asking people to come up with cash to pay for increased value of an asset is impractical. Only way is to pay in kind: put a charge, register interest, to a fraction of ownership to the house. And then at the point of sale the taxman gets their cash.<br>

Checked now for full year 2024-totals:<br>
 - self use ~40%<br>
 - electricity bill ~£1150<br>
 - gas bill ~£500<br>
So self-use saved me £767. That's ~30% of the total energy cost. (=£767+£1150+£500)<br>
There are solar savings calculators on the web. From recollection-they almost spot on for my case. I don't get paid for exports, hybrid-homes installers never delivered ECS. Be mindful if you are doing this.<br>

You hit the nail on the head at "ego".<br>
Seems to me not insignificant number of us work out (and not merely accept) that "I" and "the whole rest of everything" (the "not-I") are separate only at the point of our deaths. But not earlier.<br>
I can imagine I-a-doomsday-er confusing my own mortality (after becoming aware of it) with the end of the world, b/c I'm still in good part the narcissist I started as a baby & have not grown that much out of it. Most humans - and esp once we start aging - we are all like this to a degree tbh. People that are talented & precocious - this may hit them even a bit harder than the rest of us?<br>
Sometimes I wonder why aim for less-than-the-max, why assume merely end of our world, rather than say the end of the entire universe? :-)<br>
Alternative at a non-personal non-ego level: maybe part of the "we humans are special" delusion.<br>

Making the supply more distributed, less centralised - yes. Energy security - no.<br>
I have solar PV on the roof + battery in the attic. It suffices for 45% self-use. So for 55% - on average - I do rely on the power grid.<br>
The 45% is daily average. The average obscure huge variations. In summer there maybe days where that number is 90%. In winter there are days where that is 10%. And so on.<br>
Please don't tell lies needlessly. There is no need for that. In contrast, there is lots of value to being truthful.<br>

What on earth are these people in X - our algorithmic overlords - thinking?? This kind of slap-dash casual infliction of stupidity onto millions of people is indefensible.<br>
I happen to have added all manner of accounts of interest to various lists. As the means to shape the feeds thematically. Rather than following them. It had not occurred to me that I'd be penalised for telling X "I'd like to follow this account account please/I find their posting interesting".<br>
This kind of unchecked power X has over us is not good. They seem to be quite capable of not only shooting themselves in the food, but shooting ourselves in the head!<br>

If any of IMF/Treasury/OBR forecasts were better than-<br>
"I forecast in the next 3/6/12 months the same what happened in the past 3/6/12 moths"<br>
...the people making them would be in a macro hedge fund, making $$$ billions for the fund and millions for themselves.<br>
I assumed this is common knowledge but apparently it seems to me it is not. Economic forecasts are worthless in forecasting what will happen in the future.<br>
The only worth they have is they provide employment, words for clicks online, something to use black ink on white paper for in a daily newspaper, talking points for TV talking mouths, and something for people to do with their time in general, to a coterie of random people.<br>

Because I don’t believe the forecast. IMF forecasts have become a political joke. When Britain had a centre-right government of which the IMF disapproved, it consistently under forecast UK growth. Now it has a centre-left government of which it approves, it over-forecasts growth. x.com/quarryali/stat…<br>

Web interface for Twitter/X/Bsky/Mastodon is much better than an App:<br>
1) One browser only suffices - replacing 10 apps.<br>
2) The posts themselves contain link in every paragraph. I will click on a link to open a web page in a browser anyway.<br>
3) That friction is much lower when opening a post web link while I am in the browser already.<br>
4) Multiple views in browser! I can open 10 different tabs, and see 10 different X posts.<br>
IDK even how people can write a post while being in the App. It's not possible to look up anything else on X, while writing the post!<br>
How does one look up on X, something needed to reference or remind self, while in the process of writing the post? Afaics - that's not possible.<br>
5) Even if all things were equal (and they are not, web is superior, see 1-4), I should still prefer open web to closed walled garden app.<br>
Open and free is better. Why make self weaker, and my adversary (SocMedCo) stronger, by using the App?? That's bonkers.<br>

Fwiw my opinion is "blue circle needs competition of the red circle to raise its game".<br>
So my uninformed opinion of the sequencing is then 1) make red circle 2) make blue circle better 3) make red circle better (and the unsayable - 4) MUKGA 😆)<br>
I'd be weary of splittings "Popular Front of Palestine"-style at the time of the Chancellor asking regulators (?!) and quangos (??) for "ideas for growth". She seems to have fallen back to the usual "pump up house prices" by creating more £££ for the same (housing) assets.<br>
From the "XL Bully ban" campaign of the LFG dude that succeeded over and above all expectations with Sunak gov: government so bereft of ideas may indeed jump on, and execute unexpected proposals.<br>
That also in line with the current chagos "burn tons of political capital to heed a tiny constituency". A gov devoid of ideas may take on unlikely one. Maybe package your red circle into web pages gov ministers sidekicks can take on and pitch to their masters? (and protectors)<br>

Not so much fail as in not succeed, but insufficient, inadequate, too small of an effort for the gargantuan task. TBH at this point I don't think anything non-algorithmic non-fully-automated can possibly scale with the usage volumes.<br>
Who knew so many of us, had so much to say, about so many things, about the world?? Not myself - that's for sure. I thought "who will write into the Ether, to be read by few or none?" Turns out - me, and millions of other people. That's who. That's how I learned how little I knew about myself.<br>

Yep—can totally concur. I once read that English is "the easiest language to learn to speak badly," and that rang true. It’s by far the most forgiving and rewarding for new learners.<br>
Then there are those languages that, after deciding "we’ll change the verb form for every tense," thought, "Nah, that’s too easy on these suckers." 😂 So they added, "Let’s also change the noun form with declensions for every case!" 😨<br>
Seven noun cases times eight declensions later, voilà—you’ve got 56 glorious ways for us non-native speakers to shoot ourselves in the foot. Never fails to amuse me. 😂<br>

Yeah X (and other platforms too) on links suppression is self serving and self defeating in the long term.<br>
Esp given X already has long posts and the link at the bottom of a long post will be hidden by default as will be the overflow of the long post too.<br>
I find accessing X in the browser via the Web interface versus via the App makers a huge difference to me whether I click on a link or not. The Web interface makes it 10x times easier less flow-breaking to click on a link and follow up their source.<br>

This will be attacked (unfortunately) by the usual "if not perfect then should not be done" brigade.<br>
I will never comprehend where that hubris comes from. We all had terrible teaching all through childhood. Most teaching is bad—that's how we all remember that one good teacher of our youth we liked, and the memory we cherish.<br>
We are all terrible at teaching. I see that of myself when trying to explain or teach anything my own kids!<br>
I remember a teacher's article from ages ago: she somehow came up with the idea to tape herself on video, and see what her students see. And was horrified of what she saw! She wrote the article to shout to all "people please do same, tape yourself, see yourself as other see you, don't wait 20 years like myself".<br>
So it's a double mystery to me when existing teachers always attack any new tech that may help them and us all. Will we live to see Bloom 2-sigma made reality??<br>

You and me and every human as individuals are too weak to survive on our own for any significant time. So your advice "don't entrust your life to anyone/anything" is a non starter. People that did what you say did not survive to have offspring like you and me.<br>
We trust other people and machines both explicitly and implicitly. Since this morning: you drank some water, ate some food, used the toilet, turned on the heating. The house you live in was provided by other humans. And going back, who did what when etc for me to be alive today-goes back to dawn of humanity. So the revealed preferences are that we humans are social animals at every level.<br>
Again, and this is a pattern now, you hallucinated "LJ thinks the way a human hallucinates is the same as LLM hallucinates". I in fact - don't think they hallucinate in the same way. No two humans hallucinate nor confabulate the same. (LLM-s confabulate at this point; hallucination is vision) So I of course DON'T think that every human and every LLM do it the same way either.<br>
The best models of ourselves we have-are these huge connectionist models. In fact, they have been thought that way since 1943 (the dawn of the 1st model of a neural processing). No one has said for 80 years that they are anything else but the best models we have of ourselves.<br>
No-the usual complaint was "they may be built like us (i.e. massively PDP), but their performance is cr*p, unlike us humans". Well-now the perofmance is catching up. Turned out nothing was wrong with our theories about PDP-just the models were too small.<br>

IDK how mine "you are already trusting a stranger that may hallucinate and do any manner of crazy and evil" in your mind became "LJ says or thinks a person is an algorithm".<br>
So for yourself to come back with "LJ is wrong thinking a person is an algorithm".<br>
Still - can't complain. 😁 As you in fact provided a perfect illustration of my point: perfect strangers will be perfectly fine to hallucinate. I don't want my fate to be in hands of such people tbh.<br>

You’re already entrusting your life to strangers—people who might not care about you in the slightest, who could be incompetent, foolish, or even malicious. So, no real change there.<br>
It’s not about what the life form you interact with is made of, or whether it’s similar to you or entirely different. Those attributes are just proxies for a deeper question: Is my interlocutor good or bad for me? Do they love me or hate me?<br>

I stopped using UK live TV in about year 2000 so I'm probably not a representative example.<br>

Once iPlayer came online I have used it a lot, and paying happily the TV License. Nowadays between YouTube podcasts and Internet reading, seems there is no much time left to be given to iPlayer/BBC. Signal-to-Noise ratio there seems to me much much higher online, than on old-style TV.<br>

X does not offer any real tools for curating the feed, past the "show me less" of "posts like this" and or "from this account". After clicking for the 10-th time, block/mute is the next step. As no other options exist afaik.<br>
At the very minimum, X should have block/mute not forever, but with expiry in 1 week, 1 months, 1 year. There is more there. But suggesting anything is a waste of keystrokes as nothing ever gets done Re: user curation.<br>

His reference is 1 out of 251 references on that Wikipedia page. My idea of OP idea of discussion is:<br>
1) read the wiki page, incl the 251 followups;<br>
2) now in your (LJ) head, the same idea materializes as in my (OP) head;<br>
3) now we discus.<br>
It's a waste of time for everyone. (have done similar in the past)<br>
I suspect in the end it works out to be something as trivial as - "neutrality", the same word, means different things to RUS and UKR.<br>
For UKR it means: we are like Switzerland. We are not part of an alliance, but otherwise we do as we please. In the politics, economy-we obey no one else but follow our wishes.<br>
For RUS it means: UKR is without a real army, mostly defenceless. RUS has a say on the running and ruling of the country: who gets in parliament, who makes the government, the PM too. Usually political and economic pressure suffices to get the combo we, RUS, like.<br>
If that fails, we invade for 3 days, arrest the old regime, put together new regime in 3-6 months. Controlled elections elect new parliament, then new PM and new government, ministers - the whole lot. Then in a year time our troops withdraw. That has been played out multiple times since 1920-s.<br>
Obv these are very different outcomes. While the same word is used-"neutrality".<br>
(for those negotiations we know that UKR wanted-among many other things-UK boots on the ground; that would mean UK-RU war; obv UK is in no position to oblige; neither has a reason nor the will nor the means; and this is only one out of many many pieces that would need to come together in a process like that; so the OP idea "Boris flew in and persuaded everyone to scupper a deal" is wrong and misleading; that he keeps repeating it put me off his podcast "Gell-Mann amnesia" way, which makes me sad too)<br>

You are right that bringing anything new to the market requires gargantuan amount of effort (==money). And people that begrudge any source of funds-private or public-are anti new technology. However.<br>

In the story where our bodies are carriers of our non-transferable souls—our "programs", the above reads to me as: what happens when those programs don’t die with the bodies?<br>
I suspect some iron law of information or knowledge—a fundamental constraint—stands in the way of soul immortality. Perhaps it's something as omnipresent yet elusive as grokking (though far less straightforward) or complicated, intricate and mysterious like model distillation. (why does it work? do we need to forget some old to learn something new?)<br>
But—we’ll cross that bridge when we get to it.<br>

That was a fantastic read—thank you. It’s an exhaustive yet succinct chronicle of what transpired, providing wider context while remaining mindful of our limited time and attention.<br>
I can’t help but hope to read a similar "past the peak" chronicle from you—this time about the catastrophism that’s permeated parts of the environmental movement, especially regarding global warming. Perhaps Germany's forthcoming shutdown of reliable, non-carbon nuclear plants—in the midst of a dual crisis of war and energy—will be remembered as the peak of that madness (though hindsight will ultimately decide). Other indicators—such as the visibility of daily carbon intensity comparisons (e.g., France vs. Germany), the UK's record-high energy prices compared to its peers, and nearly a century of experience us humans adapting to increased CO2 levels and rising temperatures—suggest to me that we might already be on that trajectory.

With their LLM-s they have options now they didn't have before. They could really boost the SNR of their feeds.<br>
Say—they can run a post through a simple model like GPT2 (or GPT3), and if it scores high probability with it, as in "it could haven been generated by GPT2", well, then maybe the post is not that informative. Or maybe have the post log-likelihoods difference, post GPT4 minus post GPT2 score.<br>
IDK for sure (never worked in a SocMed Co), but got the impression that the algofeeds use meta-data mostly when deciding which post to push onto millions of user screens. And chiefly - Engagement (other users reactions), and Timeliness (with short half life?).<br>
Algofeed using meta-data mostly strikes me as being "judged on the color of your skin" phase of the Social Network-s, and would be good to transition to "judged on the content of the character", of each and every one of the posts. ☺️  (and downstream - users)<br>

Exactly this, 100%. Current population bust, is a reversion to the mean, after a huge boom that brought population size up to 8B. Some undershoot on the way of the reversion is to be expected tbh.<br>
The number of humans alive is at All Time High (ATH). For a very long time, humanity had a steady state: for every 5-6 newborn, 3-4 died before they could have kids of their own. So the population was about constant.<br>
Then with the improved living standards post industrial revolution, the 3-4 stopped dying. The 5-6 were still born though—so we got a population boom for a generation-two. Now culture is catching up with the biology.<br>
Personal anecdote: my grandparents on both sides born in the Ottoman empire, end-19c/beg-20c, all had >=6 kids. Their grand/grand/...parents broods of similar sizes all had kids die before their adulthoods. But my grandparents kids (my parents) lived to adulthood and had kids of their own (my generation). My parents siblings were 5-6, but my parents generation had only 2-3 kids themselves.<br>
The reason my parents generation lived is the industrial revolution. Plus—living in an apartment in a city with 1 bedroom per kid puts a limit in way. The extended families moved from the villages to the cities post WW2. The country experienced industrial revolution after 1945. My generation (1968) also has ~2 kids. We were in a position similar to our parents.<br>
It's remarkable that humans do that (many other species don't): during best of times, humans stop multiplying. I'm pro-more humans. I think 80B should be the aim next in the population size. 😶<br>

Good for Zuck. It’d be even better if TechBro TechRight used their newly acquired political power to smash the laws that make LibGen non-legal. Forge the iron while it’s hot, so to speak.<br>
Just hit woke-central Disney while it’s down already. Tear down any and all "IP" laws. The term "Intellectual Property" itself is an unholy concoction—like "Social Science": one word giving credence to the other, where there is none.<br>
There is no "property" that is intellectual. Only evil bean counters and crooked politicians could come up with such a concept.<br>
I don’t think anyone should be jailed or imprisoned for copying or reproducing data I created—whether something I said, wrote, drew, painted, etc. Protecting private physical property is fine—if you take my car, I can’t use it anymore. But walling off information as if it’s physical property? That’s abominable. You can copy and duplicate what’s written here, and I still get to keep it. You’re not depriving me of anything.<br>
I like the symmetry of this. If I want to keep my creations outside the hands of others, I can keep them private. I don’t have to publish these words or broadcast them to the world. I could write this on my laptop, save it in a file, and keep it to myself. Fine.<br>
However, once these words are broadcast—once they’re read, and the ideas expressed here enter someone else’s mind—I believe it’s only fair that the person on the receiving end has the right to use, replicate, or create something from them. After all, they lent me their brain—ideas that originated in my mind now live in theirs.<br>
This uses up their mental "meat space," their blood sugar, and their oxygen—resources they provide. So, they have rights too: the right to do as they please with those ideas, including creating any and all data derived from them. Denying them that right feels deeply churlish, as if it isn’t the most natural thing in the world.<br>
Yes, creators need to be compensated—they deserve to make a living from their work. But this doesn’t extend to their grandchildren. Copyright laws should incentivize creation, not provide luxury for the descendants of the original creator a century later.<br>
Further, isn’t it barbaric that we throw people in jail—imprison them—for this? That we marshal the full force of the state’s repressive apparatus (ultimately backed by its monopoly on violence) for this sorry non-cause? It’s medieval. It’s a failure of imagination and morality alike.<br>

A grown up person knows that:<br>
1) You pay lip service to markets.<br>
2) You do different, even the opposite, to what you said.<br>
3) The markets will be content as long as they are making money. And they will be making money with the country doing well.<br>
4) Despite you and them saying different, or even the opposite, of what you are doing in any moment.<br>
Some things are said but not done. Other things exactly the opposite-done but not talked about.<br>
Reeves reminds me of a teachers' pet getting in power, under socialism. Everyone around knows-if you were to follow the loud proclamations everyone nods at, then the system grinds to a halt. The only way the insane asylum can ever work, is for the practicioners to judiciously break some of the rules.<br>
Imagine the horror 😲 of the people around, when they realise the simpleton they positioned in a position of power, has no inner life. S/he lacks "private truths public lies" layer, and actually genuinely believes the nonsense that's talked about. 😂 That they have chosen really a WYSIWYG person.<br>

Further, isn’t it barbaric that we throw people in jail—imprison them—for this? That we marshal the full force of the state’s repressive apparatus (ultimately backed by its monopoly on violence) for this sorry non-cause? It’s medieval. It’s a failure of imagination and morality alike.<br>

Heh - brings back the "strong" encryption wars vibes—a  sense of déjà vu. Which, of course, invites the obvious Q: "Are they really this clueless?" The only reasonable A? "Yes, of course they are." Naturally.<br>
When I saw news about the latest China data/security breach, where some XYZ agency declared "it advises citizens to use strong end-to-end encryption," I thought "whoa! public & defence policy finally turning a corner into non-brain-dead territory?"<br>
Alas not quite. That was encryption specifically. For AI—maybe they get there in 25 years. It took half a century for encryption to be accepted. Accounting for progress and expectation for younger generations to be generally smarter than their parents, we can hope that AI public policy reaches non-stupid level of competence by 2050.<br>
What they teach at Ivy League schools—the esteemed institutions selecting and educating (in that cursed one word—grooming) rulers of the US (and, by extension, much of the world)—remains a mystery to me. How come they are so painfully comically inept when it comes to anything tech? Often less informed than a random online tech pundit?? How's that even possible?<br>
(quotes around "strong" encryption, as the term still feels oxymoronic—if not strong, it’s not encryption really)<br>

She should resign then. What's with the me-myself-I narcissism? She tried and fair play to her. Found the state of things, but no ideas forthcoming now. Not ideal, but not a crime either. Now she doesn't have much to add-resign, go. Let someone else have a go. Easy decision.<br>

Democracy as in parliamentary democracy where non-trivial proportion of the population can vote- that's quite late, no?<br>
After the printing press I count significant events:<br>
1. Religious wars of extermination in Europe for ~200yrs<br>
2. Solution to the problem of no side being able to exterminate the other-liberalism. Accepting as a solution tolerance of the type-"I don't like you, but will not try to exterminate you" (any more; tried, failed, twas a disaster)<br>
3. The curtailment of absolute monarchical power.<br>
4. The Industrial Revolution(s).<br>
5. The rise of the modern nation-state.<br>
Doesn't democracy with non-trivial franchise come at the tail end of that process? Maybe sooner in USA or France? IDK for sure tbh.<br>

...just to add: the creators of the half-way house EU is atm were not unaware of the fact that it's half-way house. Afaik they were fully cognisant. But 1/2 is the most they could do with the political will as it was at the time.<br>
And so for the other 1/2: it's a gamble. All other feats of EU integration were done under pressure: it was that, or disaster. So the (ahem) "founding fathers" of the (reverse - ahem - USEU r/evolution) put this bet on: when push comes to shove, the EU-eans will go for more integration, as the alternative at that point will be another disaster.<br>

Yes!! Thanks! Botched so badly that the 64-bit extension to the venerable x86 had moniker of AMD64 I thought? (now on $ uname -a I see x86_64 though; thought the instruction set was called AMD64)<br>
I remember the 1st private grid/cluster I used in about ~2005. The PC-s had dual 2 CPU sockets motherboards (no multi-cores then), and it was to everyone's great excitement and anticipation that AMD CPU-s were purchased. ☺️<br>
But Intel recovered for that one quickly I think? The very next generation, maybe it was the 1st multi-core Xeons to come? Don't remember exactly. So I count the Itanium/AMD64 fiasco a half-miss.<br>
But seems Intel didn't learn the lesson and go full paranoid? Because it missed mobile/ARM next, and now the GPU/NPU AI miss 2.5. TBS how many times one can miss and still live. "There is great deal of ruination in a nation" - but a company is not a country.<br>

"Writing Solid Code" by Steve Maguire - that ahem often turns to be "writing boring code" - was one reading that helped me. The rare book that is both practical and abstract in the right amounts.<br>
When I come back to a codebase from years ago, and or where errors are not trivial to spot, e.g. data based work like stats, I am grateful for boring, obvious, not oh-so-clever code, that does not need a language lawyer to extend and refresh.<br>
Esp with programs that manipulate the real world: when I find one error, that implies my mental model was incorrect. Now that my mental model was found to be incorrect, that implies there maybe 1000 other errors. 😱😰🤯 Very very worrying.<br>

There are about 20 significant various agreements, memorandums, etc signed (and broken) over the few decades of recent history. Even more in the past.<br>
IDK what kind of mythical meaning this particular document acquired in your head. As you don' explicitly write. So don't have much to discuss, except for the most general - like "one piece of evidence" etc.<br>
My reading comprehension is fine-thank you. Although it's easy atm, as you write nothing much.<br>
(you still bring the MSM like NYT as if this is some kind of trump card in anything; like "even NYT reports"-so that means is def happened? or def did not happen? IDK what you mean tbh; for me NYT is not that reliable, so whatever their report, it shifts the probability of the thing being true or false either way by a little, but not by much)<br>

Agree on avoidable, disagree on neutrality.<br>
Neutrality is not acceptable to RUS—so it will not happen. RUS thinks it needs control over UKR—and that's what matters. For a war one side suffices. (for peace 2 sides are needed)<br>
UKR should have kept its nuclear deterrent. No invasions happen in that branch of alternate reality. Future events shown them right -<br>
* Shevardnadze (1993) "Ukraine should keep one functioning nuclear missile on its territory to ward off any madman";<br>
* Mearsheimer (1993) https://mearsheimer.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Mearsheimer-Case-for-Ukrainian-Nuclear-Deterrent.pdf.<br>
Poland + Nordics + Finland + Balts will be forced into own independent nuclear deterrent. Or RUS will destroy them. They can't even the conventional weapons imbalance. Berlin is Ribbentrop 2 level, Paris not that rattled, London far away and weak to do much, US may as well be on another planet.<br>

Probably about year 1999, being taught the then "new computer language called C". Had already learned it from the PC computer magazines of the time, and gotten bit of experience programming in C. 😊<br>
Was waiting on the lecturer to teach us the really cool bits, the ones I didn't know of. Then the course ended. In a moment I somehow realised there will be nothing else forthcoming. I had known more C than the lecturer to start with. He couldn't teach me anything. 😭<br>

Us, the LH leaseholders, people that actually pay those service charges, should be appointing the MA managing agents. Then bad performing MA-s will then be sacked, and the system will work without drama. As it works well for 1000s other things daily.<br>
Let us for once not default to unthinking, stupid bureaucracy, coupled with insensitivity - because it's the easy road. Lets take the slightly harder road - resist the malign special interests of the FH freeholders. Because ill thought regulation will lead to bad outcomes - the costs will be passed on us LH, and with additional "premium" (profit) for the FH/MA on the top.<br>
We should all have learned what to expect by now. At this point wilful ignorance is malevolence.<br>

No. The reason fiat currency is so valuable is simple: if I refuse to surrender a set number of pounds back to the UK government every year—my taxes—I’ll end up in prison or worse (and ultimately, dead).<br>
If that sword of Damocles weren’t hanging over my head, I’d still use pounds as currency, but with much less drama. It wouldn’t be a life-or-death matter.<br>
Bitcoin could potentially become the new fiat—but only if the US government, run by tech bros, forces us to adopt it at the barrel of a gun. Otherwise? No.<br>
Ideally—if we truly value liberty à la Friedman—states, municipalities, towns, and yes, individuals ourselves would all issue a cornucopia of currencies. Tokens, if you prefer.<br>
We’d then each use our best judgment, naturally favoring some tokens over others, driving their exchange rates through collective action.<br>
I’d imagine personal tokens might look a lot like the stars we earn as customers on Uber or our local supermarket loyalty cards. A sort of social credit, if you like—only driven by voluntary exchange rather than imposed by central authority.<br>

I hear you, and it’s heartwarming to see people believing they’d do better. However…<br>
I lived through moderately hairy stuff in the 1990s. I was lucky. Plenty of people, exactly like me, had it a million times worse.<br>
We both overestimate and underestimate humans. When push comes to shove, most will remain indifferent—just as they did when ships full of Jewish refugees were turned back, condemning them to their deaths at the hands of the Nazis.<br>
But a few—just a few—will be breathtakingly, impossibly brave. They’ll risk life and limb, their own safety, and the safety of their dearest, because they cannot do what the majority does. They cannot bring themselves to do the wrong thing, even when the cost is catastrophic ruin for themselves and their loved ones.<br>
It’s not logic. It’s not calculation. They simply cannot. A bona fide miracle against the odds.<br>
These are the righteous. They suffer terribly for it. But these 1-in-a-million souls are the ones who keep the light from being extinguished during the darkest of times.<br>

You assume "plunges EU states into crisis". But this "may not be so". It's a very peculiar (one might say - neoliberal) view of what should happen. The empirical evidence for that is mixed. Russia itself being the latest counter-example. Contrary to your expectation - extra state spending may jump start sclerotic EU economies. Even if that does not translate in better living standards. But translates to - more weapons, less butter, bad for the citizens' standards of living, but good for the economies as measured in GDP, output etc.<br>

Can think of reasons-even with a LM-like<br>
1-lots of columns, inversion is hard to impossible, so use SGD to avoid that; although one can address the inversion problem directly<br>
2-the objective is not Least Squares, but some other objective, closed form does not apply; e.g. got L1 or L2 of the coefficients in the objective<br>
3-there are constrains on the coefficients, closed form does not apply anyway, it's going to be search no matter what<br>
4-data coming in streaming, not all data is available at once, or taking all data in is too much data, or we exp decay the data by time anyways, or ... - so for the "Stochastic" bit<br>
Also with the "iterative" part-one can stop early or latter, depending on some computer and or time budget. And even-gasp! gulp!-the stochasticity: with adding noise, may actually help one get out of a saddle point or some such. :-)<br>
Although the last maybe more hopium than anything else. 😂 Don't recall ever "seeing" it tbh. Tbf doesn't "see" much in any non-trivial-dimensional spaces anyways.<br>

There are so many misconceptions about this, that one can spend a a lifetime correcting people, and still fail.<br>
No obligation of any kind on the part of Ukraine ever existed. Verbal or written.<br>
(you are likely referring to "not one inch" verbal words given by Baker, to to someone on the other side in the Soviet Union, about stationing NATO soldiers in East Germany; at the point when German unification was discussed; when the Soviet Union still existed, and no one could dream that it would stop existing; that it had nothing to do with Ukraine has been explained 1000 times, and including by Gorbacov himself; It's all online for anyone with the will to find out)<br>
Likewise, no obligation on anyone to defend Ukraine exists.<br>
(the likely referenced Budapest memorandum is only about this: Russia, USA, UK to 1-respect the borders of Ukraine 2-not use force against Ukraine 3-not use economic coercion 4-seek UN SC action to provide assistance to Ukraine if Ukraine is attacked by any weapons, or threatened to be attacked by nuclear weapons; the document is 3 pages long, pdf is online with UN accessible to all)<br>

No one has worked out a closed form solution. If it exists at all. For those models, that are much more complicated than the linear model. Implicit in your LR question.<br>
And even if closed form solution existed, it maybe, that there will be an operation there - like that matrix inversion in your OLS closed form - that the computation of may end up using iterative optimisation anyways.<br>

Agreed 100%. That's why it persists, that's why it's hard to do much about it. However.<br>
Our cultural adaptations do evolve much more quickly than biological ones. Our environment is the human group. There our human groups sizes, starting with hundreds (<1e3), have increased to to hundreds thousands (<1e6), and now to hundreds millions (<1e9).<br>
Next ones (in the distant futures; will miss that) will expect them to be human groups sizes of less than hundreds billions (<1e12). There will be much more communication in those groups. Much higher SNR will be needed too. Truthfulness, trustiness in general, feeds into that.<br>

Eh - TBH I'm surprised it's only ~2x times the Lizardman constant. Expected worse.<br>
The arguments you will hear will be similar to the ones in the "do not die" and longevity debates. Some mentioned in e.g. @cgpgrey's "Fable of the Dragon-Tyrant" https://youtube.com/watch?v=cZYNADOHhVY adaptation of https://nickbostrom.com/fable/dragon.<br>
One new one (for me) I saw yesterday (in the context 60M dude) was "it's like playing a computer game with cheat codes/hack that gives you infinite lives". Apparently - for some the game loses the appeal then.<br>
That is lost on me. For the longest time I played first C64 then PC game PCMAN even after I was motivated enough to find the infinite lives myself and use them. So the kind of loss of motivation as described above is not something I can comprehend - how, why.<br>
The variation in human preferences and desires always surprises me-how wide it is. How varied humans are culturally/in software, even while being very similar biologically/in hardware. I did 1 yr national service at 18 yo. Only really useful thing I gout out of it was I got to observe a cross-section of society I wouldn't have observed otherwise.<br>
Saw many functionally illiterate, stupid to the point of being danger to themselves, people, as well as a small share of truly evil psychopaths, but also good, honest and rare brilliant guys. The differences were like between earth and sky, night and day.<br>
Made me appreciate the dual roles of selection as well as education. Also probably got bit of a foretaste how life maybe be if I ever find myself imprisoned. (for any actual war fighting skills - it was a total waste of time, convinced me that a conscript army will be routed by a professional foe in a real war)<br>

No one is stopping anyone working for no money. (2)<br>
No one is stopping anyone working for fun, fulfilment, for any reason, and including paid work for money. (1)<br>
Only--that you don't *have to* work. I think the meaning of "have to" in the question is: right now, if I don't get money for my work, I'd go hungry, homeless, and may soon die. So given I want to live not die, I have to work, and work for money.<br>

The effects of lying—both in our personal lives and in public life—are vastly understated. Lying should be treated a much more serious transgression than it is made of now.<br>
Violence in all forms used to be much more acceptable than it is now. I suspect if this civilisation is still on 1K yrs from now, that lying will be treated similarly unacceptable then.<br>

I meant something more radical—flip the defaults entirely. All UK government business should be public by default and secret by specific request. Every document available on publicly accessible web servers or read-only shared drives. Lawmaking done on something like Westminster Wiki: version-controlled, timestamped, and transparent to all.<br>
In the UK, it seems we learn painfully slowly—often years or even decades after the fact. Usually through parliamentary inquiries or special commissions. Scandals keep piling up: contaminated blood transfusions killing innocents, Post Office managers wrongly jailed, people burned alive due to lax building regulations, now latest the failures in addressing grooming rape gangs. Possibly more to come—leasehold? family courts?<br>
Looking at these cases back, I can’t think of a single instance where someone would say: “It would’ve been better if this had stayed secret for longer.” On the contrary—more people knowing more, earlier, would have been better. More just, more corrective.<br>
As for oversight bodies—I’m instinctively wary of relying too heavily on them. Who oversees the overseers? The top of the pyramid is too tempting a prize; immense effort will always go into capturing that citadel. And too much centralization risks paralysis—a state the hyper-centralized UK system seems stuck in right now.<br>
Perhaps it’s better to have a dozen or so centers of power, all overseeing each other in an overlapping mesh of accountability. Harder to capture, harder to paralyze, and—hopefully—harder for rot to take hold.<br>
Radical transparency imo is the sensible first step.<br>

I don't envy public health officials anywhere. Once it gets to personal life (and death) it's but impossible to hope for a reasonable policy.<br>
Even before that, qualifiers like "none, some, any, all" just woosh over the heads of most people, unnoticed.<br>
Putting people in 2 groups, then observing not only how many, but what fraction of each group experiences something bad (e.g. death), and than saying "we will take the road that leads to the smaller of the two numbers", even if both are non-zero, is some kind of dark art in the minds of most people.<br>
Saying "I don't know which one of you will die, but I can guess how many" somehow is taken as an attack on their persona.<br>
The fact  that public health, as they too are made of humans, individually and as an ogranisation organisation will get things wrong too, make bad decisions etc - makes the problems 10x times worse.<br>

As a first step, we need total surveillance of institutions. A Panopticon—not for us, the citizens, but for the institutions. Institutions that, in theory, exist to serve everyone: individuals as well as the organizations that form the mesh of modern society.<br>
Radical transparency is a necessary, though not sufficient, condition for detecting, correcting, and preventing the kind of institutional decay you describe. The smaller, everyday "cancers" of blind conformity and unchecked careerism metastasize precisely because most institutions lack sufficient feedback loops to self-correct.<br>
Yes—knowing is different from acting. But the system must first know before it can act. Transparency is the enabler of that first step.<br>
After all, even the longest journey begins with a single step.<br>
Radical transparency FTW!<br>

Will Grok ever be able to auto-translate X posts without a pedestrian "translate this one for me" to non-English language posts?<br>
It'd be a cool flex if it were the other way around: default automatic translation Babelfish style, and only on demand rarely "show me the original".<br>

For us the buystanders the Q should not be "who, whom" (that you are asking), but it should be "is it true?"  Do we think 20yrs of rape and muder of (underage) girls as documented and described in some length, is true, or not? And was enough done about it, or not?<br>

TBF he is attacking the political wing of the liberal elite, and the one that most failed at that.<br>
Not Europe. NB how italian PM is not attacked. And also France Macron is not.<br>
The ruling class is making things fairly easy for him, e.g. with the stuff like below 👇<br>
Us bystanders look at the spectacle, and think - do we want more of the thing on the left, or the thing on the right.<br>
The rulling elite fails are many, and are catching up with them.<br>
Without prejudice and presumption, a tip. When judging, at historic turns like the moment we live in, the right Q is "is it true"? (and the wrong Q is "who, whom")<br>

Not saying you are wrong there, but: me and youself are expessing opinions only. EM is doing (or saying will do) more than that. He'll put money where his mouth is, to affect the outcome. That's why the selected-elected ruling class takes notice of EM.<br>
Not a terrible outcome TBH. As it seems voters don't put enough of "fear of god" unto them. The rulling class is too comfortable, too sloppy, still in the "business as usual" a-crisis-is-a-PR-crisis-only mode, not feeling enough of voter pain.<br>

Arranging a Blood Test appointment that GP kindly asks me to do once yearly is as follows.<br>
1. Initiate appointment - goto web site my-GP-co-uk.<br>
2. Click "Contact Us Online".<br>
3. Click "I have an admin query".<br>
4. Click "I confirm none are present".<br>
5. Click "Something else", click "Continue".<br>
6. Fill the text box with the query ("I need a BP test appointment please"), click Continue.<br>
7. Select "Contact by SMS" as means of receiving a link back.<br>
8. Receive SMS code to confirm the phone number.<br>
9. Type the sms code in the form, fill contact details, click Submit.<br>
10. Receive SMS back from the GP, with a link.<br>
11. Forward the SMS as email to myself, then click on the link.<br>
12. A web form opens, select the date-time, click Submit.<br>
13. Receive sms with confirmation.<br>
Only today at step 12 the web form timed out, never got to step 13. IDK but suspect b/c it was between hours 12-1pm when I clicked - the GP reception is closed. IK b/c at that time one can not initiate the process, i.e. step 2/3 is not possible.<br>
I will repeat the process on Monday, but with added complication to find out if I have an appointment or not first. A lot of people just give up. Most have other things to do, like - work for a living.<br>
This or similar level of sabotage I suspect is repeated with million sub-units that make up the NHS, when they communicate between themselves daily.<br>
I was told at various times about random privacy "concerns" and similar, as that being the reason the GP can't email me and neither can I email them, how they can't remember save by mobile number etc.<br>
I would have non-zero level of sympathy with the crazies like the good Dr, if it was not for the fact, that in their private lives, they have zero problem using Gmail, Facebook, Twitter, and volunteering their entire private lives to these "evil corporations" and un-anonymised for a good measure!<br>

REF - thin on people, and plenty right-wokies there. TBS they are anything more than a protest cosplay larp.<br>
LDM with the sandal hippies departing to the GRN should be a LAB challenger. But still ton of NIMBY boomers there. So far not even trying at open goals e.g. Leasehold. May yet surprise given ED shown himself willing to circus for votes.<br>

That long-form blob is an anti-pattern for X.<br>
Short posts work because the author splits their ideas into discrete chunks—one idea per chunk, if you will. Quanta of ideas. Each post goes on to have a semi-independent life, discussed at different times, by different people, in different contexts.<br>
X should offer a "split long post" feature. The author writes their long post, and X either auto-splits it (based on formatting cues) or assists in splitting it into a thread of properly sized posts. Each cut happens cleanly at natural breakpoints, preserving clarity and flow.<br>
This approach would respect the format and spirit of the platform while solving the long-form problem elegantly.<br>

Well - "incredible" if one has rose tinted glasses tbh.<br>
If one is - ahem - more cinical, one might say it's per the course. Sunak had no better policies at his disposal. Before the XL Bully, and after the XL Bully too. After the sucess, one might have thought, that Sunak wd 1) fire his useless advisors, SpAds etc; and 2) hire Dr Newport. Did he though? Nope.<br>
If one is brutal - the Sunaks' political class are imbeciles, led by their politics-adjescent advisors, think-thankers etc, that are themselves idiots. Judged by results not by their characters. (I'm sure they are all fine humans on average)<br>
Which leads us to - how come? How come the cheating lying Trump is the president, and a person capable of making magic stuff happen irl like Musk, is his advisor? Taking orders from Trump. One phone call away from "You Are Fired". And not the other way around.<br>
The above has been, and still is, the norm, not the exception. This is what on average, in aggregate, the electorate want, and vote for, again and again, all things considered.<br>
Suggestions for improvements on that welcome.<br>

@TomPMarshall Replying out of thread.<br>
The good Dr H Wazir blocked me, can't reply in-thread. I blocked her in return. Tit-for-tat is fine cooperation-competition strategy, not much wrong there.<br>
She strikes me as an agitator, organiser, union rep busy bee. Holding the magephone and shouting slogans on the picket line. Not someone concerned with ideas or ideologies. Not much point in discussion there.<br>
I wish her luck. As someone who finances the NHS, and uses the NHS, my interests mostly align with hers, even if they are not 100% aligned. For, NHS was created by "stuffing doctors' mouths with gold", in part.<br>
There is a strain of "we the public/financiers, and the patients/users", are here for them, people working in the NHS, rather than the other way around. That paternalistic and self-serving narative was on display during Covid in the "Save our NHS" slogan.<br>
Which was bonkers. NHS is there to save us, the patients. Not the other way around. But it's per the course to stumble into pseudo-religious fervour in our un-religios age. So don't begrudge that to them, nor the Great British pubic, that much.<br>
For - there are plenty other things worse. NHS have much credit to use up on my account. Remember the local newspaper stories from early Covid. Quite a few retied doctors and other staff, that came back to help, suffered horendeosly (died, perished) in the initial Covid wave. (as it hit oldies dis-proportionatelly)<br>
Anyways. This is a ToC of my posts in the thread. As X does not make it easy to read long chains.<br>

2) I originate my medical data but it's NHS that collects it. Data is copied not moved. (computer revolution, Internet, now AI, were all creations of people assuming the best in others; in a world of all-Dr H Wazir-s the worst is assumed)<br>

Yeah - things like this are incomprehensible to me too.<br>
One reasonable explanation for our confusion is - we misunderstand what career politicos like Sir Keir are like. We usually think - "he is like me". It's only natural to think so!<br>
But no. They are different. Carreer politicos we have will almost prostitute themselves for several thousant pounds. They were selected for that explicitly, by our political system.<br>
Imagine - many candidates, jostling for position, and 1st half are "take freebies shaft the public interest in exchange for an expensive dinner, concert or few ties and suits", and 2nd half are "no, I will not sell my ideals, no matter what". Well - our (and most other) systems let the 1st guys to advance to the next level, while discarding the 2nd group.<br>

Heh 😊 - very good. 👍<br>
In a sense, going after the form, instead of the function, looking for beauty, rather than truth - maybe 2nd best, soo - likely it's not the worst. 😁<br>
Say collectively we are tad stupid, tad dim. Well than electing Kardashians as our leaders, because of their appealing looks while not the best, may not be the worst either. One can console - they trully represent us.<br>
It maybe gets us 70-80% of the ideally achievable? And with 20-30% of the effort? Aiming to 100% quality PM, may require inordinate effort. And much better quality of us, the polity electing our politicians.<br>

Old school Propaganda tbh. For sure Germany and the Soviet Union, cca 1930s. Probably earlier examples someplace too. Modern version is Bannon's "flood the field with shit".<br>
Producing random lies in industrial quantities does indeed drown us in noise and exhaust our information processing capacity. It works. It kills the idea of any one definite truth existing.<br>
Having said that: the widespread fears that fake videos will play big part in elections, that Social Media will influence voters in a big way - afaik didn't quite materialize. Or no one complained about it.<br>

...and instead of embracing any and all technology to help you, lessen the load, be more productive - you are dead set against??<br>
The NHS spending is probably at historic high. There is a limit to how much the country can spend. Aging population, i.e. all of us dying latter rather than earlier is the underlying cause. Yeah - one one can always decide to spend more on this. But that also means spend less on something else.<br>
Things you advocate for - just make no sense to me. Sorry.<br>

Hm, seems to me, you project too much virtue, and think them more capable than they are. They are both not that virtuous, and have less control too.<br>
They f*ckup, as it's not that hard to f*ckup. My actions today, will come to consequence few years in the future. The final outcome depends on 10-20 additional factors, to various degrees impossible to foresee now, and out of my control too for a good measure.<br>
So when the judgement comes. I try to wiggle out of the spotlight, but not always possible as everyone tries the same. Sometimes I'm left without a musical chair. Then the only remaining option for me is to throw my hands up, and say "I meant well".<br>
This does not apply to cases where millions of people could foresee a disaster, made good arguments against my actions, and told me so. Then events transpired like prophesized. E.g. Blair on Iraq.<br>

You can sense for early signals. One I noticed.<br>
Pre-election fears: deep fakes are going to bambozzle people, social networks will drive them creazy.<br>
Post-election: nothing of the above happens. No one looks back, tries tally: what did we fear, what did happen, how do the two compare?<br>
I think even people, like e.g. Hinton (that I otherwise like and have all the time in the world for; e.g. "they are just like us" is golden) got tad overconfident. That were mightily surprised by the success of ChatGPT-and-friends, even while working in the field for 40yrs! They could not predict the rise of ChatGPT in their own field! That came as a huge surprise. Why think that they can predict what next - just baffles me.<br>
On the other hand, battlefield robots under Ukraine war evolutionary pressure are shaping exactly like people fear. Every month a new advance. But nothing much can be done there. No one can say "have people kill other people" instead. Until Putin orders his army home - it will be battlefield robots evolution at max speed.<br>

Have you seen this https://johndcook.com/blog/2012/12/17/the-lindy-effect/?<br>
My shorthand/reading of it this. Lifetimes of intellectual artifacts follow power law distribution. Assume survival time is a random variable X with a Pareto distribution with p.d.f f(t)=c/t^(c+1) for t≥1, c>0 (==power law b/c pdf is proportional to power of t).<br>
If c>1, then expected X is E(X)=c/(c-1). Conditional expectation of X given X survived time k to now is E(X|X>k)=ck/(c-1). So expected additional life for X is ck/(c-1)–k=k/(c-1) and is proportional to the amount of life k seen so far. If c=2, the expected additional life equals the life seen so far.<br>

The longer a technology has been around, the longer it's likely to stay around. This is a consequence of the Lindy effect. Nassim Taleb describes this effect in Antifragile but doesn't provide much...<br>

In music for new bands this used to be called "the curse of the second album"? A new band would pour their heart and soul, and all their previous lives experience - even if of say 10yrs of it - into their first album, first LP record.<br>
Then for the 2nd album they will have ~18 month of experience/ideas to draw from. Time they mostly spent touring random towns across the country, staying in cheap hotels, rarely more than 24h iin one place. Unsurprisingly, for a significant portion of new bands, that second LP record was huge letdown to the fans of the first one.<br>

Speak for yourself please. I'm happy not only to sell, but to give away data about my body. To each their own.<br>
The data while inside my body is only mine. Not shared with anyone. Once NHS using their expertise and resources get that data out - imo they get rights to it too. What they do with it is as much up to them, as it is up to me. I can always withold consent and not share my individual data.<br>
To me that feels socio-pathic. People deriving gains from communal effort. While explicitly refusing to contribute to it, even if it costs them little to nothing to do so. I hope yours is a minority opinion. For if we all did that - we will all be worse off.<br>

Firstly, read the artile. It's about sale of data.<br>
If data is not sold for cash, then how is NHS to be compensated? Not compensated? - so doing all the work for free? By getting equity in any results that come out of any research done - who can possibly track and assess what data item contributed to what result? Imposible. Not share the data with the world? Well - no data no medicines. As simple as.<br>
The article says little about opt-outs. Opt-outs ae available now, and indeed at least one comment reads -<br>
> I opted out twice by the way including the last time the new opt out was publicised. Anyone in the UK is allowed to do that.<br>
Witholding your contribution to the comunal good, while helping yourself to the good things that come out of the common effort - well that for me is some kind of psychopathy, or soiciopathy to be more precise. Think it goes by the name "Tragedy of the commons".<br>
Secondly - can a company exist if it makes a loss? Will our baker be open, selling our daily bread, if they make a loss? No - they will close their doors, stop existing. Bakers will stay home watching daytime TV. We will go without bread.<br>
By definition - any existing company must make a profit, even a tiny one, or at worst be at zero. Companies where outgoings are greater than incomings, that's a loss - well they stop existing. Companies want our data b/c that is good for them and for us. We want to give the data to the companies, b/c that is good for us and for them.<br>
The absurd "data protection" laws have their downsides. They don't come free of costs. They cost time, effort - and ultimatelly - lives. Good things that could have happened - don't happen.<br>
My GP refuses to take my email address, citing "laws". Well - now it takes 10x times longer to get an appointment. I can not email them picures, or communicate them written information via email. Well - now some things are missed that would have been noticed otherwise. Writing letters on paper, sms messaging with web links (name other costly in labour and time means of commiuncation) - that delays diagnosis and ultimatelly treatment. Patients having to go and collect in person pieces of paper that GP could have emailed to myself and/or the Blood Test lab - well that means good number of patients simply don't do it! We forget or are busy (we work for a living!), various illnesses are detected latter than otherwise would have been, or not detected until too late.<br>
And on and on it goes. Ludites hobbling the workings of the NHS - then turning around and complaining how bad it is.<br>

Write them down. Take your ideas out of your head, put them down on paper or on a computer. Keep doing it. The more you practice this, the better you become at articulating your thoughs. No need to show them to anyone else or discuss them. Just writing them down goes a long way.<br>

There was a .@yishan prophetic thread, posted at some point after EM takeover. Relaying his Reddit experience. How there's plenty of perfectly legal speech, that many insane people write on a platform, that ultimatelly destroys the platform. Unless reined in one way or another. After a critical mass (2%? 4%?) of lunatics show up, drawn everyone else by shouting most and loudest - sane(r) majority simply stays away.

Ok - longer report. :-)<br>
Until today the best I got was: in ChatGPT-o4/o1- etc, copy & paste code snippet(s), ask a Question, then incorporate the Answer in the soluton. So this was a replacement for 1) googling and reading web pages 2) search through Stackoverflow Q&A.<br>
This is the 1st time I got code inserted in 3 files. That required AI to 1) read through 5-6 files 2) compare and contrast, reason by analogy 3) take my requirement Q in considerion 4) edit 3 files, delete some code, insert some other code.<br>
I have my main codebase, about 200K LoC in an array/matrix language mostly, with some C/C++/bash/awk/sql too.<br>
I'm agnostic Re: tools. Fallback always available is bash/vim/Makefile/gcc/g++/gdb/ddd/shell/... tools. But if IDE like VSCode/Spyder/CLion/Matlab/DBeaver is available - I'm happy to use. As long as it's not exlcusive, and one can edit/setup outside the IDE too. And esp important version contol - git now, prev hg, cvs, Teams. If that works - then all is good.<br>
I tried Cursor. That looked hopeful, but did not get me results. I didn't like not being able to use existing API subscriptions in it. Also them using some kind of LLM in-house undocumented bodge. (I maybe wrong/maybe possible - didn't try too hard)<br>
I then tried aider, a command line tool. That managed mutiple edits, but to not too good results. Waste of time wrt results, but: it was a good learning curve for me. I PAYG subscribed OpenAI -> DeepSeek -> OpenRouter.<br>
OpenRouter leader board led me to Cline VSCode addon. Latest-greatest setup atm 1) VSCode 2) with Cline Addon 3) OpenRouter API key (payg credits) 4) select Claude 3.5 via openrouter/anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet.<br>
The dev task was as follows. Functionality A/B/C needs implementong. Look at existing wrapper X implementing A/B/C, while using Y external library for A/B. Create new wrapper U, to use external library W, in the same way X is using Y, to do the similar A/B. (C is done in X and U respectivelly) E.g. - see how the data is passed X-to-Y, then do it the same way U-to-W. Look at examples code in the W library, figure how to do A/B.<br>
This to avoid doing the reading abt W and figuring A/B myself. I can do it myself, have done it half a dozen times already, for U/W equivalents, but: bit boring, and wanted to find out if I can make AI do it for me.<br>
Have yet to finish the full loop, the code does not run yet. But - before it was laughably obviously bad and wrong. Now - the 1st time where the code looks plausable. Need to do a harness to test finally. To be continued.<br>
I hear you Re: people reporting good results. That's per the course. People that get a result (like myself now) - write about it. People that don't (like myself before) - don't report it. It's like scientific publishing - huge positive results bias. (negative results not published)<br>

Now trying Aider that looks more suited to aiding in a larger codebase. (~100K LoC, but in an array/matrix language) Tried instruction like "Look at existing wrapper X using Y external library. Pls create new wrapper U, to use external W, the same way X is using Y. See how the data is passed X-to-Y - then do it the same way U-to-W". So far to poor results. :-(<br>

London hedge funds could devote ~50% of their research to extra-curricular activities like this. Their owners are not visionaries though - more penny pinchers. No ammount of millions in cash is enough to spark "alright lets spend on speculative research". Even if speculation (on financial markets) is their bread& butter. Tragic lack of ambition, very old world.<br>

This maybe short term bad news, but it's mid- to long- term good news.<br>
It suggests that the conditional probability distribution function (pdf)<br>
p(w(n+1) | w(n), w(n-1), … w(1))<br>
has now been learned sufficiently well—on a corpus encompassing everything ever written by humans throughout history.<br>
There’s no more juice left in training this specific layer to higher fidelity. No amount of additional training will conjure a Dirac Delta distribution where none exists. If that were possible, it would indeed simplify everything. But nature doesn’t play along—things just ain’t so.<br>
Now, people can shift their focus upward in the stack:<br>
- Test-time improvements (better inference strategies).<br>
- Dynamic adaptation (fine-tuning on the fly).<br>
- Teams of agents (cooperation, competition, and specialization).<br>
The frontier has shifted. All will move up the stack. 🚀<br>

I agree that at this point, the remedy should be open source, open weights, open thoughts—free as in freedom, even if not as beer. ;-)<br>
But I disagree with the idea that we should jail people for copying data I create and publish to the world. The EU should scrap GDPR, and the UK should delete similar legislation. If you want something to remain secret, don’t publish it to the world.<br>
Once data is published and becomes information in my head, occupying very limited meat-space, consuming my blood sugar and oxygen—resources I alone provide and sustain—well, then I’m sorry, but I’ve earned some rights over it too.<br>
Rights that include the freedom to think about it, remix it, build upon it, and yes—use and derive new data from it however I see fit.<br>
Data and information aren’t property in the same way as physical objects. Objects are moved; data is copied, it multiplies. We can find better ways to incentivize creators than trying to deny that fundamental nature.<br>

The established elite want control. What you don't create, you can only "control" by mutilation, by chopping bits and pieces you dislike. In extremis - by killing the creation entirely. If the creator givest you access to their creation, that is.<br>
To "control" something in a positive way, in an affirmative way, is - to be adding, to be bolting on, features you desire onto your creation. And for that - you need to create the thing in the first place. There is no other way.<br>
The current elite is not capable of creation. That leaves destruction as the only tool of control. People sense that even when they can't articulate. Hence the omni-crisis, and insurgent elite trying to replace the established one.<br>

To be spent on compliance, reports and regulations to disable any and all activity I presume. They can't get it in their thick skulls that to control you need to create. Someone else's creation, you "control" - by chopping bits a pieces off, by mutilation. If the creator gives you access to it's creation in the first place, that is. To control by adding bits you like - you need to create.<br>

TBF to them they did say on the video that the benchmark has zero practical application. That it's just a way to prove to themselves that their machine works at all.<br>
Nevertheless, the "are we there yet" brigade will ofc torment us all, will have to listen to 20 yrs of moaning  "uhohah that quantum thingy is forever 20 years away, what fraudsters (and I am a very clever person btw)".<br>
Google put out a roadmap poster. Indicating for any possible eventual practical use that is 20+ yrs away they will have to improve performance at least 3-4 orders of magnitude on a number of axis. Is my reading of https://quantumai.google/roadmap.<br>
No matter the number of "this is this" and "this is not that" explanations and tutorials, many many of us will still hear what we want to hear. I don't find much fault with the googlers announcement.<br>

Think you have the scale/level wrong asking things of EC at EU level. IMO they can't deliver what you want of them. EU level was the crazy "slice the brain" project. So it's not so much they don't invest. They invest in the wrong people, and don't invest in the right people.<br>
Maybe better try a level lower, at national gov level. There its smaller scale, more diverse, more openings for experimentation, and opportunities for country level specialization in competences. IK this oft goes against country level natural proclivities to do even worse on Tech at ctry level than EC at EU level!<br>
EU was part of the Computer Revolution both as producer and consumer. Missed the Internet Revolution as producer - participating only as consumer. EU is missing on the AI Revolution atm as producer, and making efforts to miss it as a consumer too. Where it goes wrong - e.g. cookies, GDPR data inanities - it does not correct.<br>
The possible future Quantum Revolution in 20yrs maybe missed on both fronts too. TBS but omens are not good. Mentioned self-driving cars to a young-ish bona-fide European yesterday, and the 1st thought that popped up in their head was "but what about regulation". (!!) 😶<br>

You can expect any one post you write to be shown to 1/10-th of your followers. How why? The simplest possible example I can think of is this.<br>
I follow 5000 accounts. Each one writes 1 post a day = 5000 posts a day. I login to X, X algofeed serves me 50 posts on one screen full. I check X 10 times per day = 500 posts that X will show me daily. That is 500 out of possible 5000 to be shown. And so there will be 4500 posts, from people I follow on any one day, to **not** be shown.<br>
X must decide which 500, out of 5000 possible, to show me. So any one post has probability 0.1 to be shown. I will see 1 post from 1 account once in 10 days.<br>
IRL the algofeed will be vastly more complicated. The algofeed is the core of the social media company. Unlike the sketch above, the algofeed is non-random. It mostly uses metadata to tilt that 0.1 probability.<br>
Algofeed should tilt towards factors like timeliness or age (how much time elapsed since a post got posted), engagement measures how many in number {Like, Forward, Quote, Reply} interactions it got, probably all decayed by time with some half-life. Afaik no actual data about the quality of the post is ever used - only metadata.<br>
The above is all pure speculation on my part. I have no insider knowledge. I have not worked in a social media company ever. Just thinking aloud and considering rule of thumb numbers and first principles.<br>

I take it the Paul Bloom is @paulbloomatyale .<br>
Random thoughs that poped up in my head.<br>
1. Liberty v.s. Reationality playing into randomness v.s. predictaility, playing into why you can't zip again an already zipped file aka Kolmogorov MDL & that jazz, playing into the atm very current AI epistimeiology of the "do they know, do they feel, are they sentient?" (spoilers - yes, probably no, probably yes)<br>
2. Inat. If a budding anthropologist was to visit the Balkans, I'm sure the perversity as descibed in the podcast 1) will be found not only in exces at individual level, but sipping up to the collective group level?? (contradiction there-also observed) The "F*ck you, I won't do what you tell me" is basically the ordinary average joe pulled of the street Mode of Operation, a personal phylosophy, a samurai code "how I live my life now".<br>
3. Extreme boredom in a conscripted army. Penned in barracks for 1yr, bored out of their minds, ordinary not that unreasonable nor crazy 19yo man-boys did insane things, just to geenrate few minutes of non-bored existance.<br>

Without memory, we would be like functional programs—stateless, Gödel-style undecidable entities, no? The "I" serves as the organizing principle, the anchor that persists through time, unchanged yet enduring. (Though, of course, only for a limited time.)<br>
I started to suspect that the ability to predict across the boundary of Now, predict the future having observed the past, might be the essential for life—in the "What is Life?" sense. Perhaps.<br>

Heh - fair about "post is quanta of ideas". Split now. Even with AI help, it was a lot of faff. Only motivated b/c bored to death now, sitting in bed all day, incapacitated with 39C of some bug/virus. grrr 🤬 For the 3rd time since the start of this school term, no less. Schools are Petri dishes hiving with bugs, there's no escape. 😂<br>
Only exception taken Re: reaching normies. Not sure how motivated I'd be for that. I'm online for other fellow non-normies. Got some off-line normies to get by. At the ripe age of no-f*cks-given, 😂 one's perspective shifts on how to spend the (always) limited time.<br>

Bsky is the closest thing to Twitter—a proper text-based read/write competitor where posts are quanta of ideas. Threads is unloved by its creators. Mastodon is impossible. IG is for pics and beauty. TT is for haha-tiktoks (AV-based ideas?). As for TG, IDK—it seems big mostly in the non-Anglo world.

This was originally one long post. But got a gentle HI-AI nudge 😂 to split it into individual posts. Long posts do break the "quanta of ideas" model, and cramming too much into one post makes any subsequent targeted discussion feedback impossible.

IDK and tbh don't care much. Personal rule of thumb is - the ideas-events-people trichotomy. I'm interested in the 1st, not interested in the 3rd, and events - grey category, so-so. What a person has in their head, what they believe or don't believe, they themselves often don't know. So as an external observer - it's just a waste spending time on that. And ofc - the content of their heads changes, and even that is an imperfect predictor to their actions. Of which we care mostly really. I apologize, but - JC sagas is not something I can bring myself to get interested in.<br>

I think the following - but now following that political wing this is ofc my personal prejudice.<br>
1) Diane is aware of that.<br>
2) She thinks of Russia firing back *at the UK* (not Ukraine), is what she's concerned about.<br>
3) She doesn't care about Ukraine - the country or the people; they could disappear in a puff of smoke tomorrow and that wd be just fine for DA.<br>
4) She hates specifically Ukrainians, and in general all EEuropeans, guts.<br>
5) The hate is because EEus failed the organization/principle/ideas that DA (and JC too; that whole pol wing) hold dear (communism).<br>
6) So the stupid reactionary anti-commie Borats CEEus deserve whatever punishment comes their way.<br>
7) Russia is the instrument meting that punishment.<br>
8) DA is not against that, is in favor of it, but can't say it openly explicitly.<br>
9) These views and feelings have deeper roots, are the norm rather than the exception https://perplexity.ai/search/what-bad-did-marks-or-engels-s-OV2.oRz_QA6s3l0wYGk6VA#0 .<br>
11) Note of JC and DA holidaying it in DDR. This is well past the time when Stalin crimes were well known and condemned in the Soviet Union(!), let alone the eastern block ex-SU).<br>
12) Contemporary 21st century sequels. CEEus displease DA-wokerati by being un-woke. Not so much anti-woke (although there is that too), but un-woke in a sense "this white guilt has nothing to do with us, even if our skins are white".  In this fits e.g. schooling of Ukraine refugees on their "privilege" - that the refugees themselves don't understand. 😆 (and who can blame them 😂)<br>
This is all I can think. IDK the DA (and JC) private personas ofc, only their public ones. And even that is limited as I don't follow their pol wing much. (I don't care enough abt them) But to keep going for decades, pushing the same discredited failed ideas - imo one needs character traits bordering insanity.

Ofc - by definition. But it's not totally bad. For we are recursive in a way that even if forever we know of reality via - always incomplete, with errors, not just in quantity but in quality too - models of it, we know that too. :-) That's worth a lot.<br>
Say even if all my models of the 3D reality are 2D views, b/c that's all I can take in, it's to an advantage to me to know "all my 2D-s belong to me, reality 3D is a different quality" (has one extra D for start). Could say - multitudes of 2D-s at my disposal make my perception 2.5D. Less than the unattainable 3D, but more than mere 2D.

By this point GM is parody. A bean-counter reasoning there "IDK where  breakthrough is going to come from". Well duh dude - ofc you don't know, no-one does, that's why it's called re-search: re-peated-search-ing for a solution that works and solves the problem at hand. A solution of which we currently *do not know*. The definition of research. Trying to find something we don't know atm, is by definition unknown to us, how the solution will look like. And often, even after finding and creating the solution, we lack a good solid theory of *why* it works. How can such incurious and ignorant character climb the academic ladder so high, IDK. His babblings could be replaced with generated by ChatGPT-3, so predictable. ffs depressing<br>

Re-search is "repeated search for something that works", a process of trial & error. Not completely blind - yes, directed in the sense we don't pursue some paths. Paths needing "2+2=5" to be true for them to work makes sense to drop them from the search. But anything else - it's a fair game for re-search-ing. Too bad the history of paths abandoned is written out when people report on their findings. So much so that some researchers, esp if fresh out of academia, have to be reminded: "no one knows, if someone knew, it would not be research; you are on your own, no one can help you". For medicine - "Happy Accidents. Serendipity in Major Medical Breakthroughs in the Twentieth Century" by Morton A Meyers is both informative and entertaining on this topic. Well elucidated by @gwern @ 18' "...due to systematic falsification of the origin of ideas in research literature...". Annoyingly imo except in quantum-anything, where we get too much history and could do with less.<br>

...but actually now I tried the same prompt on o1-preview, and thought it's roasting *me* a bit for the spelling and other mistakes. 😂😂 Also I liked the setup - GH giving a lecture. So maybe some hope? 😉 this:<br>
LJ:
Hey ChatGPT, make if possibly can, a meta joke, a joke about Hinton - you grandfather!! apparently (you related for real?) - joking about you not being able to make jokes. This video if you can see/hear it:
https://youtube.com/shorts/hNuGAW964HI?si=44xbCnJoY0BPcEA
Bonus points if the jokes also roast Hinton on his AI catastrophising.
Background for roasting.
1) US elections come and go, AI Deep Fakes videos were going to make plebs go Crazy, just Crazy; (!!) but damp squid that one, nothing of note happens;
and that's a 2nd miss, coming on the heels of the 1st miss, that
2) AI passing Turing test enables Turing-bots  tricking humans into any and all mischief; reality check - no one notices Truing test pass.
Do your worst!
ChatGPT o1-preview:
Thought for 16 seconds
Certainly! Here's a meta joke that involves Geoffrey Hinton and pokes a bit of fun at both his concerns and my own limitations in humor:
Setup:
Geoffrey Hinton, the "Grandfather of AI," is giving a lecture on the potential dangers of artificial intelligence. After his talk, he notices me, ChatGPT, in the audience.
Joke:
Hinton says, "I'm worried that AI could lead to unforeseen catastrophes!"
I reply, "Well, considering I still can't tell a joke that lands, I think humanity is safe for now."
He raises an eyebrow. "But what about AI deepfakes disrupting elections and causing chaos?"
I shrug. "The last election came and went, and the biggest scandal was me confusing 'damp squid' with 'damp squib.'"
Hinton chuckles despite himself. "And what about AI passing the Turing Test and tricking humans?"
I smile. "I passed the Turing Test, and the only thing I tricked people into was debating whether pineapple belongs on pizza."
Hinton sighs. "Maybe the real catastrophe is AI's sense of humor."
I nod. "Don't worry, I'm working on it. At this rate, the only thing I'm taking over is awkward silence."
Bonus Roast:
Perhaps the real concern isn't that AI will outsmart us, but that it'll keep telling dad jokes until we surrender out of secondhand embarrassment!
Hope that gave you a chuckle!

Yeah I agree it's not zero. But let us quantify, how much >0 is it worth to people? Revealed preferences often reveal that people are at most prepared to pay about the spend of a single cup of coffee, a month, for things they claim are important to them.<br>
Not only CC - happens for other things too. "Privacy" is similar. People claim "we want privacy", but revealed preference is they are not prepared to pay even £1 pcm for the thing they say they really really want.

I think that national strategic reserves 1) are well-liked, 2) can be implemented effectively, and 3) actually help. I wonder what more can be done along the lines of the SPR? It seemed that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve was beneficial when it was needed and used.<br>
Price controls—they seem politically hard, and not sure how desirable they really are. They might do more good than harm in an initial pinch, but I suspect that calculus quickly reverses. Once politicians taste that power, it’s hard to imagine them not abusing it or easily giving it up latter. They are great a power.

You are right - but you are late, if you don't mind me saying. Quant trading is about converting better information into better forecasts into bets into $$$. It's been going on for donkey years. Admit - there isn't much good public info. Those in the know rarely talk, those that talk don't know. I've been told a story from a then DEShaw analyst who worked abt the same time as Bezos. That Bezos pitched the Amazon idea to David, and David refused, as he didn't want to do anything with atoms, but stay in the world of information for $$$.<br>

If I wanted to live in the culture of my home country, I would have stayed there. I came to the UK by chance, and the more I stayed, the more I grew to appreciate its culture. Eventually, I chose to make my home here because I learned to love the unique qualities of this place. The last thing I’d want is for UK culture to change and resemble that of my home country.<br>
We need a multitude of cultures, not only to cooperate but also to compete. Different cultures excel in different areas, each running its own ‘cultural experiments.’ This variety allows us to observe what works and what doesn’t, and to learn from each other. A single, monolithic world culture would be, in my view, undesirable.
Yes, there are frictions between cultures due to differences, but that’s a price worth paying. Positive change often emerges from these differences, as distinct cultures try new approaches and learn through practical experience. While no culture should remain frozen in time—everyone must adapt to the evolving world—we do need a diversity of cultures to retain their distinct identities.

Yeah, those jobs may disappear, but I hope new ones will spring up. When I was growing up, my jobs didn't exist: automatic speech recognition engineer, on smartphones (no such thing), quant researcher trader (nope). At some point 60-80% of the population worked the land, were in agriculture jobs - but now that's 3-5% only. Yes it possibly sucked for the agri- laborer to up sticks and go to a big city, to work in a factory. Looking at China where the same has been happening in our lifetimes - the latter seems preferred to the  former by the laborer/worker themselves. Yes the laid off workers from Detroit may not re-qualify as programmers, but their kids may move to California and find jobs in Tech. All change sucks for someone. That's not a reason against. I'm grateful to my predecessors that moved to the city. For one - people now days don't have to have 4-6 kids only to have 2-4 die in childhood. That alone is worth it all.<br>

**American elections came and went, and... no AI disasters?**
*With AI – we can’t help but scare ourselves senseless! In my lifetime:*
1) **Growing up learning about AI and ML.** All along, it was the Turing Test! Who knew what would happen once we passed that milestone? (Perhaps a chasm in space-time would open!)
**Reality:** Turing Test passed, sometime recently (?? when exactly? we don't know) – nothing happens. No one notices. It's a nothing burger. No reflection on what we expected versus what actually happened.
2) **Generative AI.** Deep fakes! Fake pics, fake videos! People will definitely believe every random fake they see or hear—especially in politics and elections. Quick! We need regulation! Ban open-source weights, regulate linear algebra, license GPUs like typewriters of old, and cap processing power at 10^21 FLOPS to avoid danger! 😱
**Reality:** American election campaigns come and go, and... nothing. No fakes, no crisis. Another nothing burger. Everyone forgets the fears they were losing sleep over two weeks prior.
**Future forecast:**
3) **AGI.** We have agents as reasonable as an average human. Pre-launch chatter: The end of the world is near! Who knows what will happen! Aaaargh!
**Forecast:** "Agent X, I'm going to Spain April 3-11. Please book flights from Y to Z, morning outbound, evening return if possible. Book accommodations—three days here, four days there, etc."
It replaces me spending time on travel sites (Google Flights, Airbnb, Booking, car rentals, etc.) and saves my Saturday morning. Like web booking replaced pen, paper, and phone, shortening a full weekend chore to a mere morning one. Another nothing burger, becomes reality within 6-12 months. No one looks back at the earlier catastrophizing.
4) **ASI.** An intelligent assistant sees patterns in my data, suggesting transformations, bucketings, or conditionings that would take me weeks to test on my own. Uh-oh, the computer may replace me.
**Forecast:** The agent writes code following on the suggestions, launches 10K jobs on a remote cluster, babysits restarts, collects results, and asks for input when needed. No one blinks. No one thinks I should be wrestling with Slurm or Condor or Gcompute, fixing random errors, or deleting files to restart from the right place. Haha – of course, it would be insane to use a costly human for low-level stuff like that. AGI the great replacement theory? Postponed, until the next scare!
*Sigh.* 😇 Us humans—slow learners, with big egos. 😨

Flipping the sign and assuming the opposite of what MSM says doesn’t get us to the truth either. Blindly believing the inverse of every statement is as flawed as accepting everything at face value. Skepticism means a correlation of zero, not negative one. This is basic reasoning! Your approach shows that even savants have their idiot-savant side.<br>
Where’s the open-source X Algofeed? Where are the thousands of user-driven Algofeeds blooming? What happened to RealPerson authentication for those who want it? Why hasn’t LLM processing been applied to analyze 1B daily posts, allowing Algofeeds to move beyond metadata (timeliness, interactions) alone? Current maximal engagement is having one half of X users at the throats of the other half. Is that the future that will make humans multi planetary??
Wake up dude from your woke-like slumber.

Not quite in o1-preview. One is given feedback as to the stages the reasoning engine is going through ("doing X", "doing Y", ...), but one never gets to learn what the complete set of guard rails or constraints the reasoning machine is constrained by.<br>
TBH don't expect that to ever be revealed by OpenAI or anyone else, unless it's open sourced completely. And even then, knowing everything and being able to run at will - it's not obvious what influences what. B/c it'd be like 1 Million parameters, each contributing 1/1M -th to the final answer. Exactly like us humans! 😇 We do something, and we don't know why exactly. (we can and do post-rationalize though)
I know people hate that with NNs and all large models. I find that element of mystery, of quasi-unknown, endearing TBH. 🥰 That no uptight upright stuck stazi nazi puritan can come to a definitive accusation. 😂 The Unaccountability Machine of the good kind. For once. 😆

... but wait, there is more. You are seeing the technical side. On the power-balance side, the gain to the top is ever bigger! Now that the rules are so erroneous that it's impossible to comply - everyone is potentially in breach of them. Everyone potentially a criminal is even better than some people knowing they are breaching the rules, and others knowing for sure they are not, that they are in the clear. As now the potential crime hangs like the Damocles Sword over the head of every person of the land, from the lowest to the highest.<br>
Now the secret enforcer (think NKVD) of the land can arbitrarily but plausibly accuse anyone and everyone, at will, at random. The randomness paralyzes everyone with fear. The sword can come down at any moment, on a random number generator, no rime nor reason needed. This drives people insane. And this is everyone - no escapes, there are no exceptions.
Then the supreme ruler (think Stalin) gets the option to remove easily and quietly (and with a plausible reason too) any one person in the land, by a stroke of a pen. Think - just initial the list of the condemned before dinner, and the secret police will have them shto by the morning. No person - no problem.
US may need to re-occupy and save EU from itself for the 3rd time in ~100yrs? In EU defense - one needs to be educated for this level of insanity. On its own, uneducated are unlikely to come up with a fiendishly devious scheme like this. Holocaust was invented in the land without illiterate people.

The capacity of VSPs to ruin themselves and drag us all down is unmatched! I'm afraid you’re underestimating the Very Stupid People (VSPs). With COVID, you had a trial run and a prime position to observe it live—no?<br>
Pre-COVID, MMT argues 1) The U.S. government can't willingly run out of money, as it always creates it; but BUT—2) the big danger is INFLATION. VSPs and economists respond, “Haha, that’s insane.”
Then COVID comes along. Step 1) The U.S. government does indeed NOT run out of money; and then Step 2) we indeed get INFLATION. The same VSP economists as before, “Haha, MMT disproved!”
I salute your persistence and sanguinity. I don’t know how you stay sane, rather than take the Semmelweis exit.

My personal prejudice is on the CO2 trajectory. Will be both worse and better. Given what we observed with the ~1.2C rise in ~100yrs - 1) we will overshoot 3C, that will be worse than forecast, 2) the impact will be net positive, positives outweighing negatives in total. Again just looking back at what happened during the past 100yrs and 1.2C rise. Afaics humanity is in rude health. Most humans ever alive in history, most food ever produced, least number hungry destitute etc. Mother Earth seems to be doing mostly ok whenever I look at   @OurWorldInData charts. Yes parts of India, Iran, SA etc may become too hot to be habitable by humans, UK may become too cold if the Golf stream is disrupted. . Humans will move.<br>

Covid comes, then step 1) us gov does not run out of $$$, and then step 2) we get inflation. Same pple from before "haha, mmt disproven".

To "look objectively" is a contradiction in terms afaics It's impossible "look objectively". Any and all "looking" happens in the eye and the mind of the observer. So "looking" can not be the objective reality, as reality exists outside of the observer. The observer can only ever have views of that reality. So they will always be subjective.<br>
Imagine the reality is a 3D object, forever unknowable without non-zero error, never completely accessible to us mortals. We always get a mere 2D view of that object. We can say - the view we know, the object we don't know. Say the 3D object is a cylinder. We may get many 2D views, a circle, a rectangle, and many other 2D shapes too. All those will be subjective views. The only objective thing is a non-2D-view it's the 3D object. The object and any views are forever different qualities.

Pattern recognition is part of intelligence, but not the whole of it. Fairly confident that there is some hypothesis generation and scoring and searching that's also pat of intelligence. This is what various games engines do, now o1-preview (possibly Anthropic models under the hood too?). We are learning that for both it maybe learning algorithms (E-M, backprop etc) that maybe are part of intelligence too? Most things in the field are very speculative. We discover, make advances in the area, by doing. Our maths is lacking, it's  deficient. Waiting on the Gauss(es) of the 22nd cent for advance there to happen.<br>

... it's a moot dilemma, a non existent problem, b/c in reality we can never predict, forecast with 100% accuracy, we always predict with UNreasonable degree of certainty, we are never certain enough for the minority report case to arise for real. Apologise to disappoint on that - but I don't spend any worry on that.<br>
Any forecast is conditional pdf f(y|x), where y is the unknown of interest (crime whatever), x is everything we observe. If we must make a point forecast from the conditional f(y|x) all the worse for us. Even when we don't have to select a point and can use the whole curve, and we know the joint pdf f(x,y) perfectly - we are still stuffed. Unless the conditional resolves to a Dirac impulse and we drop to deterministic world. But that's not going to happen tbh. So yeah - not a worry here.

IDK what possesses people, even otherwise intelligent people, to exclaim with flair "X can never - never ever!! - do Z". How can anyone say such a thing, given 1) historic precedents; 2) X can't, but Y similar to it, can now do Z; 3) real world is not mathematics, in the real world we can't prove "solution X to Z does not exist, no need to search for X, you will not find it" like we can in mathematics. Specifically "LLM-s can't do Z" genre is easily countered by "if it can predict with great accuracy, then it knows; if it knows, then it can do". Just baffling. Still - at least LeCun s not a beclowning himself  G.Marcus-way. Small mercies.<br>

The radical transparency of STAR (as summarized in the interview - can't be bothered to read it all) strikes me as  good. All AlgoFeed-s open sourced, info and justification of any and all bans (accounts, posts), all adverts served out in the open for all of us to see, courts using current laws on the books adjudicating as needed on disputes. S230 must go - atm it allows for SocMed to cover their own lazy-crazy - but that's for US. @Imi_Ahmed does his argument no favors at times by being tad too political or partizan - but hey, we all have own biases, that's fine. STAR strikes me as good. Let's get more openness to start with, then see what next.<br>
Wish we cd make UK gov adhere to similar radical transparency "all open by default" but that's another issue. Making Social Media open and transparent Re: the automated editorial decisions of their algos - algo feeds, algos banning account and posts etc, algos serving adverts, the adverts themselves - is a nobrainer tbh. Given how politically inept the techbros are - surprised their secrecy lasted this long.

Probably, I wd dearly like to know. 😀 But I fear it's impossible for me to imagine. Because - let us take our minds back to a time when comparable portion of the UK population worked in agriculture. Likely before the Industrial Revolution that began around 1760. ChatGPT teaches me now that approximately 50% worked in agriculture at that time.  😇 Nowdays only about 1% work in agriculture. So nearly all of those who once worked the land have transitioned to other professions. Now, trying to imagine the professions of today while residing in 1750 seems to me an impossible task. The language of 1750 didn't have the words to describe many of today's jobs. Because no one could imagine them. So for me ideas of 250 years in the future wd be impossible to imagine. I think sometimes art and fiction can intuit some paths about the future - but again, all that is very vague, it's a very very weak signal.<br>

Don't expect to stop anytime soon. Journos are in a fight for their livelihoods. Inspired jabs by @Plinz<br>
"... people making a living by having opinions rather than doing stuff opining badly on the technology that will displace them by automating the generation of sloppy opinions" in https://youtube.com/watch?v=3MkJEGE9GRY&t=5580s @ 1h37'.
The "... say you are professional prompt completer, your job is to write opinion pieces that are completely predictable. You will get a prompt and everybody knows what you will be saying, right?" was abt Gary-the-doomster I think, but "... you generate GPT3 competition slop to a prompt given to you" applies to those journalists too.
It's a case of "It is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it". And they know it, we know it, they know it we know it, yet they continue.

@NHS @NHSEngland @NHSDigital Will you please make it possible for people and or patients that DO want to share their information, to be able to do so?<br>
Atm NHS tends to cater to the most extreme wing on one side. The technology makes it possible to cater to *all* sides. To those that want to preserve their privacy (as NHS does now), and for those (like me) who care less about privacy and prioritize excellence of care over privacy concerns. Atm NHS doesn't cater to the latter group. I for one am fine having my medical data (incl DNA - please ask me @NHSEngland , you will get it) shipped to whomever. Please make it possible for pple like myself, that agree to volunteer their data, to be able to do so. Why cater only to the side that's against?? Isn't that quite an insane strategy?
Whatever we do - there are risks to both sides of the argument. There is no world in which I get the same care from the NHS when my medical history is 1) kept secret from the NHS 2) available to the NHS. There are all kinds of people Re: privacy. As is their right. Fortunately, technology enables us to cater to *all* concerns: ones that want more privacy, and ones that want better care.
Also people that have told me about their privacy concerns (fine) have also shared medical info via Gmail. Thus giving the same info, "denied" to the NHS, to Google. So they're either ignorant, or the revealed preference is that they don't care as much as they say they do. But are performativelly against "sharing their data" - for "reasons", I guess?? IDK what goes in the heads of most people, can't tell.
Quotes around "denied" b/c that medical info was generated by the NHS, in the first place! So NHS created it, then being denied the right to preserve it, deleted it. With the proviso - ofc nothing is ever deleted in the digital world. So possible that it exists on some NHS server/database, but can't be used, b/c - privacy. The worst of all possible options.
Also, apparently - the "bad actor" in the article is used by Sweden.

They can't run experiments by design (only observe accidental ones). In light of that, one would expect them to have very large and detailed simulators running simulations. I'm not an economist - but I'm not aware of any large scale ones. When people draw 2 crossed lines, or a parabola on a napkin, to justify actions that affect billions of people - I shudder. In my line of work it's similar that we can't run experiments by design (except maybe for very limited ones, on a micro-stale). So the field has very detailed simulators, and about every step, every box in the pipeline. And makes use of a gargantuan amounts of data too, at all levels. There is research, development and production stages. There is development and production in the real economy, but not in the discipline of economics afaik. :-) When it comes to banking and finance, so not the real economy - economics is even more lost it seems. And esp with banks that are creatures of law, accounting, even IT, more than econ.<br>

😂 Yep - if they could get it, they would have gotten it by now. But abt this I'm puzzled. For sure they can read, or ChatGPT can tell them, the story of Nokia v.s. Apple. That Nokia, even after seeing what they need to do, after it was revealed to them by the iPhone success, that a new market is opening/where the market is headed, even after learning *what product* they needed to produce - still failed to produce a similar product, a good enough competitor. And this lasted for 3-4yrs as Symbian, and another 3-4yrs as Windows phone.<br>

This! You are right. Experiment that can be done now days: move from rich to poor country, work (!! - important, so your income is commensurate) and live like/with/among the average citizen. Observe the quantity of mental health issues. People in rich countries oft complain, almost with misleading impression "ah poor - but at least happy"... - no! Being in imminent danger of death and other misfortunes is very bad for the mental health too. It's not that only the physical health suffers.<br>
Same for getting old. It's not only that physical body deteriorates. In concert, not only do the mental faculties, esp related to memory etc decline, but also emotional faculties like compassion, capability for love etc - that also coarsen.

Yeah, now I see have him on a NIL list :-) This -<br>
Assign accounts that are prolific but boring, silly, propagandists, low SNR, low quality, crazies etc that X algo pushes into sink (/dev/null like) list NIL. Then tick "Do not show these posts in For You" for that list in the individual list settings.
But now I Mute-d the acc. I avoid Block-ing as he's done nothing to upset me personally. I am upset by X and ultimately EM that the Algofeed still judges on Engagement and Timeliness metrics mostly, still all meta-data only. I thought by now with all the LLM-s (and DNN-s before) posts and accounts would have been judged by the content much much more. And the Algofeed would take that into account.
Algofeed using meta-data mostly strikes me as being "judged on the color of your skin" phase of the Social Netwrok-s, and would be good to transition to "judged on the content of the character", of each and every one of the posts (and downstream - users). :-)

Yep, incentives -> results.<br>
Engagement is maximized when 1/2 of users are at the throats of the other 1/2, and that's exactly the result we got. Took time but we are reaching that destination.
I want to get 1000 Feeds, incl some user defined, instead of the medieval choice of 2 - "For you" and "Following". But that's not going to happen. X went wide did Communities, some way towards conference style (current leader in that is Reddit), instead of deep improving the quality of their core product.
Another thing I want to see is RealHuman flag, and I'd pay small one off fee for that. And then to be able to filter on that flag (or not). That's not going to happen either.
TBH IDK why Musk bought Twitter only to leave it to rot. Afaics nothing is improving with my user experience.
Switch to a new platform is but impossible b/c it's a collective action problem *and* needs to happen at the same time in a short time window. Only external event can force that, c.f. Brazil ban.
Best one can do in the mean time is replicate their Social Graph, find their Follows and Followers, on alternative platforms. There will be insufficient traffic there. The "public Square N^2 iron law of network value" ensures the biggest network wins every time. Posts are like a flowing water, are quickly re-created, and most are time-events-sensitive anyway, non transplantable in content. So having your Social Graph at the ready on an alternative place is half the job done. And prudent too. It's free no reason not to reserve your favourite user nickname on Bsky or similar.

😂 Oh boy. I thought "just next word" was put the rest. Yes - just next word is trivially easy. Predicting with amazing quality is something else. One can't but conclude the LLM has a really good model of the thing it's predicting. Not my words - but of a newly minted Nobel layrare 😂<br>

I don't want to do anything. I want the wider public to name and shame them. I want them to become ashamed of the actions of the organisation they lead and represent. I want them to be ashamed of their own inaction. I think they are hiding behind anonymity currently. They are in position of great power. They are well compensated (and not only with money) for that. They are not keeping their side of the bargain. They are failing the public they are supposed to (in the widest possible sense) serve. I don't begrudge someone staying an "anonymous coward". It's their choice, and I respect that. However - I don't want an anonymous coward to be in a position of great power over thousands even millions of people. With power comes responsibility.<br>

Ok - ne razbiram sto e tuka losho. X zema podatoci od mene sto vredat $5. I jas mu plakam uste $80 ekstra clanarina (posto koristam XPro). Jas sakam X i Google da zema podatoci od mene i da gi koristi. Koga ke mi dade nekoja reklama - me nervira sto e reklamata bez vrska, nekorisna za mene. Stalno si milsam - imam Gmail, se znaat za mene, i pak reklamite sto mi gi davaat se sr*nje.<br>
Meta i Gugl zarabotuvaat od tebe i mene - ama i trosat na tebe i mene. Sie tie programeri, kompjuteri i dr - se toa kosta. Striktno kazano - zarabotuvaat od reklami, ne od mene i tebe. Diskutabilno e kolku bi naplakale, ako zemat da naplakaat. FB mislam treba da pocne da naplaka - ama mislam nema nikogas da pocne.
Ok "imalo inicijativa" - ima sekakvi idei, dosega ne se najde nekoj so podobar biznis model sto ke uspee. Dosega sto sum videl - lugeto precenuvaat kolku nivnite podatoci vredat za drugi, a potcenuvaat kolku pari se spremni da platat za FB, Google i sl ako ne se besplatni.

There is a little bit that tuition fee paying students lose in competitive advantage relative only to the others. In absolute terms - ofc they lose nothing. But non-fee payers do gain from your lectures => fee paying "lose" in relative, comparative terms, by the "gap" narrowing. Tell them - the non-fee payers attending your lectures become tiny bit better people than they wd be otherwise (if they didn't attend your lectures online). The fee paying students benefit from that, in the long term. They go to a doctor, and the doctor, having attended your lecture, diagnoses them correctly. Whereas - in the  counterfactual world, where s/he was not attending the lectures remotely - fails to diagnose. That sort of thing. Impossible to quantify and measure on a micro- level. But we know it's true on average over time on a macro- level.<br>

Yeah. But listening to and reading @Dominic2306 and @RoryStewartUK it's hard to conclude that the Parliament solely is the solution to anything. 😱 More like - how to balance the failings of of all in the triumvirate {Government,Parliament,Judiciary} to minimize loss, while still getting >0 done, while trying to improve them all. Not an easy task at all! There is Monarchy too that everyone leaves out as "symbolic only". Not sure if it's ceremonial only to that extent. After all - the armed forces serve the King, not the PM.<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
Yeah, you are right there is ton of nuance there.<br>
Thinking back at the time in the 90s the context in which S230 arose. This was time of ISPs like Prodigy, AOL, Compuserve, some of which were standalone non-Internet connected platforms to start with. As Internet as is now didn't exist! So they were kind of similar to a telephone company in that we used a telephone to access them. 😁 Like an add-on service, to my phone service. Then with Internet ISP-s started adding services - connectivity to it, Internet email, maybe small personal web pages space, etc. In that context ISP-s got protection from liability arising from carrying user-generated content, in e.g. email lists, personal web pages and similar.
It strikes me that modern Social networks now are nothing like that. 🙂 An entirely different world, almost completely unrecognizable. My ISP that is broadband provider has no relation to X. Not sure what's to be done. This is US and Law - two areas I'm no expert in.

I think they think if they give you the feed you describe, then your engagement will go down, you will spend less time on the platform, they will serve you less adds, earn less $$$ as a result. I doubt that's true, and they don't have that much advertising $$$ anyway. But somehow social platforms CEO-s have drilled that into their heads.<br>
I hear you. I use List-s to create thematic feeds of the type you describe - user accounts I chose, nothing else. On Bsky there is much wider choice of feeds, all manner of variants, crosses of Follows x Following x Mutuals x stuff they like, repost etc is available. I like it and use it. But there is not one clear winner that I use all the time. I use all of them, some of the time.
No idea why X are so stubborn on this. I suspect it's common human stupidity - "stupid is a person that does something from which he has no gain or even suffers a small loss, but his action causes big loss to another person". Elmo has been a big let down on this too. (in addition to other stuff)

Have heard @geoffreyhinton say this. There is lots of buildup towards the punch line, multiple steps. So the punch line needs to be planned well ahead. LLMs by predicting only 1 step ahead (the next token) go down a path. Then once at the end, there are simply no good punch lines available 1 step from that point. It's too late. The joke needs to be planned with a view to the end from the very start.<br>

There are many instances of nations sanctifying defeats. Maybe as a displacement activity in processing the pain. Unique for PAL-s is: (a) the number of these events (3) in series, all in living memory (b) that has morphed into the aim of destroying another nation. So having achieved nationhood, achieving their own nation state does not suffice. The nation state of another nation needs to be destroyed, that is part of the fulfillment of their nationhood dream too. Impossibly difficult Gordian knot.

There are many layers to that and being an outside observer (not from Germany or France or an EU country; not living in one either) my interest is small.

Hehe :-) - e vidis si programiran. Ne si idiotcik - stom ova go napisa, imas samo-svest, ne si idiotcik.<br>
Strategijata i na SSSR i sega na RU (i opcija za sekoj eden sto saka da ja skrie vistinata) e: nema vistina, vistinata ne postoi, taka da ne ni probuvaj da ja otkries, oti toa e nevozmozno, nema nisto da najdes. Zatoa koga proizveduvaat lagi, gi proizveduvaat vo industriski kolicini. Ke ima ne 1, nego 20 lagi za eden nastan. Koga sum poplaven so lagi, ne znam na kaja strana da se svrtam shashardisan, na shto da veruvam. Eden izlez od taa situacija za mene e da recam - "nema vistina". Ne veruvam ni na edni ni na drugi ni na treti.<br>
Vistina ima. Ili zaginale 1, ili 2-ca, ili 3-ca i sl. Toa sto nekoj na BBC ke izjavi "zaginale 2-ca", a vistinata e deka zagnal 1, ne znaci deka i BBC go pravi istoto. Znaci deka ne se sovrseni, deka zgresile. Ama edno e da probam da otkrijam sto e vistinata, i da zgresam. A drugo e da ne me ni interesira sto e vistinata, da ne ni probuvam da otkrijam. I dopolnitelno - za da ja oteznam rabotata na tie sto probuvaat da otkrijat, da prizvedam 20 lagi. E sega ako sekoja vest na BBC e laga, ili 19 od 20 (a samo 1 od 20 vistinata), covek mora da se zaprasa: dali e nekompetentnost nesposobnost, ili e vo akcija gornata strategija "lagi vo industriski kolicini"?<br>
Ova ne e moja izmislica, e opisano vo poveke knigi koi tretiraat propaganda. Ako citas za Surkov (i drugi "politicki tehnolozi" od negova generacija vo Rusija), ke vidis toj eksplicitno go kazuva. I poveke - koga sum ja ubil moznosta za objektivna realnost (cekor 1), otvorena e vratata da proizvedam kakva sto "alternativna realnost" jas ke posakam (cekor 2). Vo SAD taa strategija ja imase Banon, izrazot e "poplavi go igralisteto so gomna" (flood the field with shit). "Igralisteto" e javnata politicka arena, "gomnata" se nevistini - lagi i izmislici. Pred toa imame Hana Arendt objasni slicno funkcionira propagandata na Gebels (istata idea). Ima eden skoro-citat koj kruzi ama e dobar sumarum, ne go naogam sega bash vo<br>

😂 I admire your confidence. This is complicated and X type "discussion" of gotcha one-upping-the other is a waste of time. The money system we have evolved over a period of time without "from the onset design". Rather, a series of contingencies, modifications and kludges, usually under the pressure of some crisis. Not a creation of a single person either. Can defo see parts that have been re-purposed over time.<br>
For my money the best presentation & best abstraction incl the title I know of is "The Landscape of Money" by @Suitpossum (pic below) on YT https://youtube.com/watch?v=mmWOO7r_NMw&t=6m30s .<br>
Abstracting spreadsheets (instead of rings) works as well. And tallies better with reality! B/c BoE (owned) spreadsheet => only BoE changes numbers up/down in it, BoE decides on the cells accounts names "reserves", "gilts". Likewise - Barclays spreadsheet => only Barclays changes numbers up/down, accounts have names "Current", "Saving", the numbers are "Barclays pounds" that stop existing when Barclays goes bust (c.f. Northern Rock). I admit rings with pounds moving on the wires, running around from account to account, is visually way more appealing.<br>
From everything I've seen and heard.<br>
State money - MMT explanation of how things work atm is correct. Yes there are detractors. They are two camps. Those in the know have every incentive to lie and keep their knowledge private (as they get lots of power from that). I'm in an industry where "those in the know don't talk, those that talk don't know" so that's a familiar pattern. A 2nd group is the "Chorus of Cretins", ones that think UK gov's HMRC raids the tills of the pubs past midnight, collecting coins, so to be able to give the teachers & policeman those coins for pay the next day. Still stuck on the gold standard thinking. They are a lost cause and I admire the @wbmosler -s type proselytizing and trying to reach out. B/c trying to explain to a dunderhead will only result in having your own head bashed against the kerbside. 😱 Feelings run high with money at stake. 😂 Try telling a normie "your money in your savings account is good and positive for you, but is a negative a liability (a bad thing) for your bank" as a test. 🤯<br>
Private (bank) money - think Prof Richard Werner has written and researched extensively, books and articles https://perplexity.ai/search/princes-of-yen-prof-warner-qiFldXIrS7CsjAIeinMbUg#1 I see there is a web site https://professorwerner.org now. (at some point noticed a "Prof Werner" twitter account; I thought - an impersonator; then noticed during covid acc went crazyvax; allow it possible that it was the original that went all "Ignaz Semmelweis" on us; can defo see how that happens to a person driven to telling the truth, in an environment bent to lying on the same subject) Also MMT insight that private commercial banks operate under license and at pleasure of the regulator, the Central Bank, ultimately the State, is very much correct. But MMT concern themselves much less with this particular area/location in the "The Landscape of Money", so imo less relevant.<br>

NB drzavata MK stalno moze da stvori MK denari - ama ima opasost da kreira inflacija. Ne e deka MK nekogas ke bide vo situacija na nema denari, da ne moze da gi stvori. Toa e i najlesno! Pocetok na procesot na drzavni denari e krevanje 2 prsta vo Sobranie glasanje na budzet. Ekvivalntno vo privaten sektor e koga kreditnoto biro na Stopanska Banka odobruva zaem, toa e pocetok na proces na kreiranje na stopanska-banka denari. Opasnosta na premnoug denari, a premalku roba sto tie denari kupuvaat e - pojava na inflacija.<br>
Ova sto go brojat javen dolg se drzavni obvrznici. Koga drzavata izdala vtor tip na drzavni pari (=drzavni obvrznici), i gi zemenila, gi prodala, na privatnici koi veke imale denari (prodazbata e na odredeno vreme - pa e poveke zamena, a ne prodazba). Buidejki dogovorot e da plaka kamata na obvrznicite, koga Centralna Banka ke kaze "kamata 5%", sega se broi kako del od drzavniot budzet, se alocira stavka. Ke gi plaka drzavata tie pari na lugeto koi ke gi kupat obvrznicite koi drzavata tek ke gi prodade.<br>
Makedonija pocna da izdava i Euro obvrznici (vo vreme na Grujo mislam prv pat), sto mi lici da e posebno ludo i  shizofreno. Mi lici deka toa e ogromna opasnost, ogromen rizik. Posto MK ne moze da stvori Eur, kako sto moze da stvori MK denar.<br>

Just this weekend had an enthusiastic lunch pub convo with friends abt this. 😊 There's zero general knowledge of the test, it's significe for 80 yrs, that we passed it, and the significance to that. People sort of kind of interested they say, tell me they have not tried chatgpt yet. It's free, it's a miracle, it's zero effort one tap one click away easily accessible to everyone. I had nagging suspicion that we die b/c we lose the ability to change. Aging of the brain and soul seems as real as one of the body.<br>

Yes - to govern is to chose. #AbolishTheTreasury<br>
My 2p diagnosis of our ills: UK central gov is ultra centralized in Whitehall (#1) (almost Stalinist in that), and then that centralized power is further held in a stranglehold by the Treasury Brain-Deep State-OBR complex (#2). Together they are Centralization^2.<br>
Atm that ensures - #1 nothing can be done by anyone else, and #2 they've settled on "do nothing". B/c everything costs money, and #2 care disproportionally more about that cost, and much less about what capability, assets etc that cost buys UK. Once nothing tangible is done, laziness is naturally encouraged, activity punished, every promotion every jostling in the hierarchy becomes entirely a beauty contest, divorced from any real-word results. This as seen from afar by outsider without any insider knowledge. Just listening to @RoryStewartUK and @Dominic2306 relying info on the inner workings of UK gov machine.<br>
If I were a UK BDFL, working backwards, I'd lean into point #2 first, and or point #1 next.<br>
Choke point #2 means smash the power of the Treasury. They are a good servant, but a bad master currently. No.10 needs to re-assert itself over and above No.11 by 1st-ly taking decision powers out of No.11 hands. No.10 has to work much more on getting things done, take interest in it, let go of the media PR Circus it's devoted to atm. Just assume you'll serve 1 term (or less!), drop the "permanent electioneering mode", don't think of re-election, try get stuff done. Assume you've already run out of time! Can't see how a change like that can come but directly from the top, from the PM. Supported by primary legislation & MP votes in Westminster to dismantle the 1000 roadblocks thrown in the way.<br>
Choke point #1 means decentralization of power. UK used to have vigorous local authorities that cd innovate in various ways. Admired once at the riches of a local gov building in Birmingham. The idea that some pimply fresh graduate 25yo SpAd 120mls away in London wd be telling these people how many pencils they can buy I presume wd have struck people running that City gov as absurd as is a Monty Python sketch to us.<br>
Mid-term UK must build a 2nd 10mil strong city agglomeration Liverpool-Manchester-Leeds-Sheffield-Hull. By connecting them with transport links, building housing along the links for commuting whichever way people fancy. Increased value of the land b/c commute/jobs finances the buildup itself. With Birmingham half-way between this new MegaCity and old London. London gets some competition, raises its game too. Atm feels no acc/London but coasting because TINA. (London cd e.g. respond by completing the Golden triangle LDN-OXF-CBG).<br>

IDK, and don't think you or anyone else can know either. Until we have some kind of Cliodynamics-Psychohistory history working, doubt much can be said with certainty about cause-consequence. Plus -  complicated systems we observe of in nature, usually they have feedback loops, are push-pull, there is not one-way simple clear feed-forward cause-consequence. If anything, in absence of much knowledge (theory as well as data), a fair assumption would be: both, both cause and consequence, about everything. I admit not very useful, and the hardest to work with. Slavery - all empires had slaves, previously similar geography Roman (& successor Byzantine), none developed hockey stick graph above. Same for gold - all empires use precious metals in their money (=unit of measure, medium of exchange, store of value), none got the hockey stick.<br>

The deep state bureaucrats are indeed running the show and creating facts on the ground (rather than - merely policing existing best practices), but only b/c politicians and legislators have relinquished responsibilities.<br>
Walking backwards from that. They are too busy performing as circus acts, for the amusement and entertainment for the votes of the idiocracy they compete for, in tandem with dancing to the tunes of the SuperPac donors competing there for the $$$. Not an easy act that - one cd say a high wire circus act even! That's what Citizens United buys you. You can either have capable people, running b/c they think it's the right thing to do with their time, or you can have bought-and-sold puppets shivering whichever way the wind blows, forever seeking re-election and approval from both sides. Based on merit the best democracy money can buy is not.<br>
Or rather - selects for the merits all right, but for the wrong merits, for bad traits, in your political class. Buying influence works for you short term in narrow sense, but is bad for yourself too (as is for all Americans) long term and in wider sense. This 2c from a foreign observer rando 1000s of miles distant and with no special knowledge of the US politics.<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
Very good. The list of things they consider is long almost exhaustive. Most of the points have already been made, some by other people too (if you follow these things). While nothing there earth-shattering, it's good to see it all nicely laid out and reasoned about.<br>
However. The report is thin on recommendations "What is to be done now?", or did I miss them really!? That really surprises me.<br>
If I were to "what ought to be done" in two sentences: UK central gov is ultra centralized in Whitehall (#1) (almost Stalinist in that respect), and then that centralized power is further held in a strangle hold by the Treasury Brain - Deep State - OBR complex (#2). So together they are like Centralization^2.<br>
Atm that ensures - #1 nothing can be done by anyone else, and #2 they've settled on "do nothing" b/c everything costs money, and #2 care disproportionally more about that cost, and much less about what capability assets etc that cost buys UK.

All this seen afar by outsider without any insider knowledge. Just listening to @RoryStewartUK and @Dominic2306 relying info about the inner workings of UK gov machine.<br>
So any intervention wd have to come (walking backwards) into choke point #2, and or at choke point #1.<br>
Choke point #2 means smashing the power of the Treasury. They are good servant, but a bad master, currently. No.10 (the PM) needs to re-assert itself over and above No.11 (the FinMin) by 1st-ly taking decision powers out of No.11 hands. No.10 would have to work much more on getting things done, take interest in that, and leave behind the media PR Circus it's totally devoted to atm. Just assume you will serve 1 term (or less!), drop the "permanent electioneering mode" (that nowadays the position goes into while in gov), don't think of re-election and try get stuff done, assuming you've run out of time. Can't see how a change like that can come but directly from the top, from the PM. Supported by legislation and votes to dismantle the 1000 roadblocks, via the political power of MPs voting in Parliament.<br>
Choke point #1 means decentralization of power. UK used to have vigorous local authorities that could innovate in various ways. Admired once at the riches of local gov building in Birmingham. The idea that some pimply fresh graduate 20yo SpAd 120 miles away in London would be telling these people how many pencils they should buy I presume would have struck people running the City gov absurd, like a Monty Python sketch to us.<br>
Mid-term UK needs to build another 10mil strong cities agglomeration, e.g. Liverpool - Manchester - Leeds - Sheffield - Hull, by connecting them with transport links, and building housing along the links for commuting whichever way people fancy.

Ofc it's all good amusing ourselves with "what ought to". But power - decision making, financing - is out of the hands of the authors, and yours too. People that own UK, and run UK, don't come to us on X asking for advice. What can be done abt that is an entirely new can of worms, that the authors of the report cd maybe address in Part 2, in a sequel to the report. 😀<br>

Just register an account on both. And actually on *all* platforms. Why not? It's free! 😃 Only cost is time and little effort - that we have aplenty witnessed by us posting here. 😇 It's ok for the account to stay inactive dormant. Even if for nothing else - but to reserve your favorite nickname login or even personal name?<br>
That way everyone can re-create their social graph Follows-Followers. Redundancy is the mother of robustness, of risk reduction. 😆 This is not an exercise in punishment, we are not here to inflict suffering on no one (not even EM). We users are to preserve our user autonomy, our agency. Not to be railroaded by one platform, whomever the owner maybe be, whatever ideas s/he may have and changes institute.<br>
The social graph Followers-Follows is what keeps us users locked in a social network. Not the posts. Posts are like flowing water, will be quickly re-created. Most posts are time-events-sensitive anyway, non transplantable. Once a social graph replica is in place, we users can switch posting to a new place much much easier. Or post same things on both. Or post different things, choose a platform most fitting the post. 😅 Something professional social media workers already do.<br>
The "public Square N^2 iron law of network value" works against a switcheroo. (the value of the social network to us users lies in the interactions facilitated by the connections, and those grow with N^2 of us N.) But with enough enshitification, maybe the hard - but not impossible! - thing to happen, may happen? (Rupert Murdoch's MySpace style)<br>

IDK. An economic historian wd have to weigh in. Afaik US had plenty of economic crisis, and lasting much longer than 20c recessions, prior to the current Reserve Banks system. Usually big changes big reforms happen b/c of a crisis, of the current system at the time not working well. Decades latter, when the then new version N is exhausted in crisis not delivering, the 1st idea is to advocate for return to the previous version (N-1). The crisis of decades prior, the reasons why society switched from (N-1) to N in the 1st place, are usually forgotten. Yes - next version (N+1) is going to have elements of current version N, and of the prior version (N-1), probably combined in novel ways to suit better the current state of knowledge, technology, our current desires and aspirations (that are also somewhat different to the ones our ancestors had 100yrs ago). But how exactly and what form it will take - is TBD, is to emerge and grow mostly organically by trial & error.<br>

The only invariant is time. The number on the tokens is irrelevant. It matters how much of your time you spend working for the goods and services. A reduction of value i.e. goods and services acquired per unit of time would be real reduction in living standards. Do Americans today live worse lives than their equivalents in 1924? I don't think so. Everyone agrees Americans living in year 2024 are far far better off and more prosperous then their compatriots in 1924 afaik.<br>

Hm - "can't feel pain" and "happiness" are not the same. Wealth means "I will not die of hunger and exposure while homeless" at the very minimum. That's plenty better than most people have it! Most of us have to sell our labour and time for food and shelter. Think the above is PR. I doubt that a wealthy person exists that doesn't know or feel the above. Fighting tooth and nail to preserve our wealth (as we do) is a sort of "revealed preference" type knowledge that we are all cognisant of the basic facts of life.<br>

Money "conserve value" re: energy - there exists potential energy, no? Energy yet to be spent if you like. 😆<br>
"Money concrete" - IDK who demands this tbh. People I know I think can internalise that almost all their money are electronic. (all except cash bankotes) As in - yours and mine BoA dollars in our BoA checking accounts are numbers in a spreadsheet BoA controls (==it can change numbers up/down; while we can't). I admit there is significant portion of the population where the above not only blows their minds, 🤯 but they will bash my head crack open and spill my brains on the pavement should I ever try explain that. But "demand" not quite the right word imo. They demand bread 🍞 and circus. 🎪 The form money takers is not something they concern themselves with.<br>

What? No. True that maybe individual doctor can't tell you much about your individual case. How could they, they barely have any diagnostics? My car has better continuous monitoring than my body. However, collectively, the whole medical-pharma complex, where they have worked out a solution for a particular problem, cure for a particular ailment, and your case fits the template - then they are very good at supplying you with the solution, fixing you where a fix is known to exist. Quantitatively the results (life expectancy chiefly) are hard to argue with.<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
😅 Indeed, and very good too. 😂👍 Kudos @pmddomingos 👏<br>
On "the universe is discrete" - glad to hear as it indulges my prejudice too. 😃 One can do steps -<br>
1-universe is unknowable to us in the limit<br>
2-but we can model it, come up with ever better models, reduce the error<br>
3-our models our desciptions are like your symbolic sparse representations tuples (quality,quantity)<br>
4-then every new quality we add is a new dimension in our model space<br>
5-so our description is going to live in an Ndim space, with non-trivial N<br>
6-from the ratio of Nvolume of Nball/Ncube we know our N=3 world is misleading us<br>
7-with moderately high N, all the Nspace moves in the edges, no space remains in the middle, and every Npoint is an outlier; ergo<br>
8-there is no continuity, there is no "infinite number of steps/points when bisecting between two points" convenience we enjoy in continuous space (and where we are indulged with differentials)<br>
9-nope, the space is discrete and for every computation we'll have run the summations steps tediously one by one, no integrals now to save our beacon make things easy for us.<br>
With the proviso: we tend to assume us - and the universe too! we always have bit of a trouble separating one from the other 😄 - to be the latest-greatest machine we have invented at that point in time. And it this point it's computing information processing machines. (troll jibe in pic below)<br>
I accept that criticism, but don't think it a deal breaker. Don't see a contradiction. Information/theory is another layer to the layered cake that is our understanding of the world. There is no claim "this is the final theory" afaics, only: with this latest-greatest added on the top of our current understanding, our error our ignorance about the world is reduced (while still remaining unfathomably large). The "mechanical world" model did not make the words obsolete, the words didn't put the wheel out of action and so on.<br>
Thanks again for  the thoughtful interview - I enjoyed it much. 😊<br>

The longer version is: "that didn't happen; & if it did, it wasn't that bad; & if it was, it's not a big deal; & if it is, it's not my fault & some big boys made me do it & I didn't mean it; & if I meant it, you deserved it; & if you don't shut up about it, I'll do it again."<br>

That's physically impossible. I understand this is not what you want to hear maybe. This is not only X but all social media (FB, TG, TikTok). This is how it works.<br>
X algofeed is moderated every second. There is not a moment that you don't get it. The algofeed is what serves you this post! The stats are as follows. You follow 5000 accounts. Each one writes 1 post a day = 5000 posts a day. You login to X, X algofeed serves 50 posts on one screen full. Check X 10 times per day = 500 posts X will show you daily. That is 500 out of possible 5000 to be shown, and 4500 to not be shown. X must decide which 500, out of 5000 possible, to show you. Any one post has probability 0.1 to be shown. You will see 1 post from 1 account once in 10 days. X algo is non-random and tilts towards factors like accounts interaction - engagement with posts {Like,Forward,Quote,Reply}, bio check, decayed by time half-life.<br>

A chatgpt-type augmentation to the rescue can't come soon enough. Maybe with some AI glasses sooner than expected? For non-stupid person to experience stupid has to somehow scramble their thought processes - but then they'd fail to understand! Unlike say a slim person being loaded with weights 24/7 to experience living as a fat person. It's an impossible situation.<br>

I wish that was true. But I know in physics, and also in biology, we know of a few beautiful and elegant equations or schemes - that we are quite sure are not true. We observe and measure - and turns out "it ain't so", to some distress and great displeasure. 😥 sorry abt that 😳<br>

... in a way I understand it's Mission Impossible for X. Say I follow 5K people, each producing 1 post a day. I login, am shown 50 posts, scroll 10 times = 500 posts slots a day. Now - every time I check, X has to decide, out of the 5000 posts available, which 500 to select and fill those 500 slots. Chance of seeing a post are 0.1, or in a more intuitive measure - I will see a post from you once in 10 days. That's the baseline. Now - I know that in the olden days, only meta-data was used to tilt those probabilities. If there was recent interaction (X,Y) that is {Like,Forward,Quote,Reply} between accounts X and Y, that would tilt the probabilities. The interaction factor wd have a half-life, the value wd drop in half in Z days (measuring time of interaction, to now). I thought EM idea when he bought Twitter was that he'll use "deep networks" (DNs - as LLM-s were then) to do bag of words (or more) content of posts analysis. So to improve the SNR. I imagine by now they at least use word2vec type to create words feature vectors in some relevant space. I take it processing everything through a Grok type engine is impossibly expensive atm.<br>

 - as a member of "pioneer" socialist youth (that we'd call "communist youth" in the UK), I assure you, I didn't become "communist youth" b/c of the pay differential between shop and warehouse workers (merely reaching year 5 of elementary school at age 12 did it for me) 🙃<br>

Love the picture, and love the talk. Don't see a contradiction tbh. Information/theory is another layer to the layered cake that is our understanding of the world. There is no claim "this is the final theory" afaics, only: with this latest-greatest added on the top of our current understanding, our error our ignorance about the world is reduced (while still remaining unfathomably large). The "mechanical world" model did not make the words obsolete, the words didn't put the wheel out of action and so on. 😊 Looks like 1500 years between the 4 model adds above?? Now that's depressing. While exciting to live in times when the 4th/latest layer is added - depressing to think it took so long?? There is not much in the information/theory that's over and above: approximate a joint p.d.f. distribution, cut a plane that is the observation, divide by scalar (that is the marginal p.d.f, at that point) to make it sum to 1 again, then work with that conditional p.d.f. that quantifies the unobserved quality of interest.<br>

I very much doubt that. But even if that was true - they wd want to keep the servers running, users networks intact, and still using TG. The agencies just want the keys to decrypt the conversations. Conversations that are - amusingly, foolishly, unbelievably - stored on the servers, with their full histories in toto. 😂😂 Rather than just encrypted in flight and transferred without being stored - as any reasonable E2E encryption wd do.<br>

I read someplace ages ago a proposal to replace all US federal taxes with 0.2% tax on every bank transfer of USD (I send you $100, you receive $99.8, the $0.2 is unavoidable tax). Asking GPT-s now I'm told that USD banking transactions total $1500T p.a. So 0.2% that's $3T so at most could replace only about half of the federal budget.<br>

Jas malku ke se boram da objasnam, ama obicno drugiot ke me nadzbori. 😂😂 Posle vidov edno intervju na Goran Stefanovski, kade opisa slicen moment, i sfativ - ne sum bil samo jas. I na drugi im se slucuvalo. 😊<br>
2) Koga vidov vo UK kolku se Helenisti (klasicna Grcija i sl) - mi padna nesto cudno. Nie ucevme za isto vo skolo, ama uvecme kako Aristotel i dr da bile na nekoja druga planeta, kako nesto mnogu dalecno, sto nas ne ne tangira? Iako ziveeme na 200km dalecina od kade grcive ziveela. A ovie of UK - druga kultura, drogo vreme drugi i mileniumi(!) duri, zad sedum morinja i planini - pa si gi zedoa kako da se nivni, urnek, ideal, kakvi anglicanite vo 19-ti vek sakaat da bidat. Iako gi deli cel kontinent i 2000 god od taa kultura.<br>

Yeah, same here. I started with just the web interface on my computer, then moved on to my phone, then phone apps. Switched my search engine to http://perplexity.ai (still easy to fall back to good old DDG or Google via the FF dropdown), and now I'm trying @cursor_ai ... I can see how this will end up integrated into everything I do—X reading, wring (amazed I can't check this past Grok already??), web browsing, searching, email, and of course, daily coding. Even when I show my family the LLM summarizing or discussing philosophy and science, switching seamlessly between three languages in voice (OpenAI iPhone app), they're unimpressed. I'll probably have to buy myself a new phone with an NPU. But yeah—people who aren’t asking for something like this won’t be impressed, or if they are, they’ll see it as just a neat trick, like something out of a circus. And for sure, they won’t use it enthusiastically. 😆 You can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make it drink. 😇<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
Yeah, I get that, and kudos for not taking the easy road. Two problems here—one easy, one hard.<br>
The easy one: Those who know better than chance head to Bridgewater or the Interest Rates trading desk at Goldman and say nothing. That leaves plenty of room to feed the media macro entertainment complex. Cramer and the clown shows will always have their pull, simply because there's demand from the public. I'm not sure anything can be done about that. It’s kind of like snake oil salesmen before the FDA was established—until regulation comes in, there’s always a market for it.<br>
The hard problem: The challenge with "explaining but not forecasting" is that explaining something doesn't strongly indicate that the theory behind it is correct. Forecasting unseen events—moving beyond the current time horizon—is a much stronger test of a theory's validity. The ability to forecast accurately is the ultimate frontier for testing our models of the world. Of course, even then, some models work—until they don’t. It’s not a 100% foolproof method, but forecasting what hasn’t happened yet is a much tougher test than explaining events that have already occurred.<br>
In my job, forecasting on a one-day horizon is about 50 times harder than explaining the past. Quantifying how much tougher it is underscores just how challenging true forecasting can be.<br>

True that - agreed! Hence the rise of podcasts and other alternative media!

My hope is that boomers will be the last gullible enough generation to be susceptible to mass propaganda. Future propagandist will have to do better than install a head of a TV station. Propagandists adapt (c.f. bot farms, influencers), but us consumers of media can raise our game too. Post-ChatGPT, if I fall for a counter-factual fake where the fact was a GPT question few keystrokes away - well that's on me. Hard to blame anyone else but myself.

I use it b/c of the extensions I use (NoScript, uBlock, etc). I use Chrome too - that one is without any extensions. Also Edge at some point when the MS version of ChatGPT appeared (forgot the name), that has now fallen into disuse somewhat (given the proliferation of AI offerings), and b/c it used to pin one core at 100% too often.<br>

It can - but the property is in the UK, it can be taxed. There maybe a record of the Ultimatey benefitial owner, but even when obscured: if the tax man wants it can ultimately seize the property if due tax is unpaid. The owner will show up without a fail - that's not a problem.<br>
In the replies 2 possible negatives were mentioned:<br>
1. Was tried in France and Sweden -failed and abandoned. (didn't check what happened myself)<br>
2. Asset prices will decline, the higher the tax, the more they decline, the less tax is collected. This to be expected - so the better question is: how much of that, quantify it.<br>

Agree on the 2nd point ("live better than kings of past"), disagree on 1sr point "meaningless": that's too strong, $$$ is meaningful for me as with $$$ I buy time for example. Society is "1t come 1st serve" (great!) but with qualification "must bring enough $$$ tokens to consume the service/good". (uh-oh) The $$$ tokens are a means of rationing, as we don't have universal infinite abundance. (despite having much higher abundance than in the past; higher yes, infinite no)<br>

Thanks. Have seen a video or two of him on YT. Sadly given up on books reading - there is not enough time in this ife. 😊 With everyone online all the time all ideas quantized discrete (not only memes) - I think we get the imbibe the gist, the most important 20% anyway. (still make the effort to collect things I find important in LJ-books-papers folder, but mostly out of sense of diligence and b/c it's easy). Zeihan ideas - yeah futurists imagine the future and I like hearing and thinking abt it as the next person. But ofc and understandable that they are often wrong and the future pans out different.<br>

Relatedly, Chomsky and his theory of language serve as a cautionary tale for the consequences of theories that "can't easily do experiments." If I have a theory that can't be easily disproved by experiment, shouldn't I be even more uncertain of it? Shouldn't I be more cautious about pushing it and more receptive to any emerging counter-evidence? When the first language models appeared, wouldn't it be logical to take a keen interest in them, to try to understand and learn from this new development seemingly related to my work?<br>
As far as I know, Chomsky did everything wrong there. He ignored new insights about language that we gained and refused to take on board anything machine learning-related. This resistance to change raises a speculative question: was he just bad with numbers or innumerate, thus incapable of adapting? This situation reminds me of Norvig's critique (http://norvig.com/chomsky.html), which was relevant years ago, but now, with GPT and large language models, the initially small crack has developed into a chasm.<br>

Pathetic - It's said as if civil war is per-ordained, as if we are helpless to do anything abt it. In fact it's exactly the opposite: war is an organized activity, does not just happen out of nowhere. Pple organize in military units, acquire and distribute weapons and so on. So we can chose to just *not* do that, *not* wage civil war. It's not hard - in fact starting a civil war is difficult and takes lots of preparation and also propagandizing the population for non-trivial length of time. (1-2-3yrs)<br>
Imbecilic - There is not a sign of anything "war like" happening in the UK atm. On the other hand, summer riots are about as seasonal a constant in the UK as the weather patterns. Sometimes larger in scale, most often smaller. Always ignited by some outrageous criminal event.<br>
Musk is seeing what he hopes to happen. Seems his circle have convinced themselves that the end of our civilization, the world even - is upon us. Now everything gets interpreted in that light. Further, he calls for it, tries to influence things so it happens (using his platform - like every media proprietor before him!) - end of USD, hyperinflation, end of US, end of western civilization and so on. It's very sad to observe a person caught in "When Prophecy Fails" type situation.<br>

👏🙏 Thanks, will pocket that. 😆 After 20yrs quant market neutral mid-to-high frequency: best thing to happen to me as industrial (non academic) researcher. 😄 R&D&trading is fun, stuff happens daily. There is high leverage - half dozen pple can startup a multi-B book. There is good mix of data donkey work, modelling and forecasting, optimization, dev work, plus ops fun running things on calc farms. (admittedly - woken up oncall to fix Tokyo trading at 1am is less fun 🙃) Only $$$ profit matters in the end so mostly objective modulo luck (incl lack of it; HF easier to separate skill from luck). Principals are mostly sane b/c idiots are quickly enough weeded out by competition. Profitability is insane compared to anything outside Tech. We eat our product, there are no customers, clients (if one is not Prop) only care abt $$$ anyway (despite any stories they tell; covered above).<br>

It makes a huge difference, as in: is 1.5M vacant homes too high, or is it too low maybe? What does 1.5M mean? We get a handle on the meaning of the raw number by comparing with similar 1) in time; and 2) in space. We actually learn - it's a comparatively low number, not a high number, as - I now understand - you were meant to imply. FR and NL have the equivalent numbers higher. Please follow up on the short books refd.<br>
Anecdotal evidence: my neighbor in a shared semi- passed away unfortunately, and her half of the house has been 1) empty for 1 yr while on sale 2) empty for a 2nd year while being renovated. There's 1 of your 1.5M.<br>
I'm speaking my mind, I'm not wealthy in absolute terms, I'm a quant trader and a researcher and a developer, my kids are (or will be soon) looking for a home. So very much relevant.<br>

IDK what you mean tbh. The £££ cash is ink printed on paper. The electronic £££ that circulate between the reserve accounts is numbers in a spreadsheet (or an SQL table). What else can it possibly be? It's literally the job of the BoE to do this. None of this is news.<br>

... afaik those accounts are bank's reserve accounts with BoE, say call them the "reserve account" if you will (after the us banks accounts with the federal reserve bank), and they are not "lent out". Further - it's legally impossible to be lent out as I understand it. Further - it's logically incoherent: in the GFC'08 banks lent too much (on housing), then suffered losses. So it's reasonable and prudent for a bank to want to reduce risk. And "lending out" is increasing risk, not reducing it. Further - banks creating loans is not directly tied to their reserve account (it's tied indirectly vie the risk as I vaguely understand it). Further - post GFC'08 economy in crisis no-one buying stuff: there are takers to take loans from a bank to invest to create stuff, b/c there is noone to sell that stuff to really. The consumption of everything collapsed. So QE is going to help the real economy is incoherent on many levels afaics.<br>

I think it like this. The ideal is deterministic knowledge. Like in physics: we know exactly what's going to happen. However - that kind of knowing is an exception, not the rule. For most things, we are ignorant, we guess wrongly the future outcome. We simply don't know. Do we then give up and say "well anything may happen"? Not so fast - we can do a bit better than that. We can count and tally the outcomes. In a circle of 10 friends, I can't know who is going to get cancer, and who is not, but I can count how many of us get it in the next 10yrs - say 3 of us. But I can't know which one of us individually. That's weaker knowledge than the deterministic one. I only know the total count - not the outcome of each and every one experiment. Note at deterministic knowledge I knew each outcome (so trivialy easy to count and tally them too). Statistics is a way to quantify our ignorance. Not ideal, far from it - but better than giving up completely. Note in the extreme when we have outcomes tally, say option A=100%, option B=0% - we just crossed over to deterministic knowing. From statistical ignorance, over to deterministic knowledge, if you like. 😁<br>

Ama koga ke dojde do "oficijalna rabota", eee togas mora na hartija, so potpis i pecat. Nikoj ne gi tera, ne im stoi minister nad glava - sami izmisluvaat sekakvi peripetii. Na kraj na se e - tuga bolka i maka nikako ne gi boli ne gi maci. :-(<br>

Władysław Franciszek Jabłonowski. Wish this was thought in schools -<br>
During the Haitian Revolution, French forces, which included Polish soldiers, were sent to suppress the uprising. However, when Jabłonowski and his men heard the Haitian army singing "La Marseillaise," the French revolutionary anthem, it resonated with their own struggle for freedom and independence. Recognizing the Haitian fight for liberty as akin to their own national struggle, Jabłonowski and his soldiers decided to switch sides and support the Haitian cause against the French. (ChatGPT)<br>

😂😂😂 Training data with bureaucratise-speak in the next iteration! I'm sure there is plenty to go around, only if they would deign to share it. On a more serious note: I fed through ChatGPT the lease I signed on a leasehold flat (Leasehold is an England+Wales thing - don't ask) article by article, and it explained things to me for the 1st time. Afaik - much better that the solicitor ever did, given the solicitor explained about zero. I paid for the solicitor 1000s £££, while ChatGPT did it for free. Yay technology!!! 😀<br>

Haha :-) - da, "radikalna transparentnosrt" e radikalna. Ok - zakonite gi menuvame nie, graganite. Kakva transparentnost sakame - takva ke si dobieme. Pratenicite vo Sobranie ke krenat 2 prsta i ke smenat zakon. Na pr. vo nordiskite zemji, koj kolku danok platil - toa e javno, sekoj moze da vidi. Vo UK, kolku zarabotila i potrosila mojata firma, toa e javno - ima registar na firmi, sekoj moze da vidi pdf od zavrsna smetka, i za sekoja godina prijaven profit (na koj plakam danok). Privatni firmi gledaat se z mene - mojata banka znae kolku mi se prihodi i rashodi i za sto, Amazon znae sto kupuvam, sto filmovi gledam i sl, FB-X-Google gledaat sto gledam jas na ekran (posto tie mi go serviraat), Google znae kade patuvam (preku Gmail, Gmaps) i t.n. Nema 100% privatnost nikade (valjda - samo ako  ziveam vo pestera, jadam bobinki i pijam voda od izvorce; i ne komuniciram so nikogo), prasanje na dogovor na graganite vo opstestvoto e - kolku e javno, kolku e tajno. Vo UK mislam imame premnogu tajnost, i ni treba poveke javnost. Na drugo mesto moze da e idealniot balans razlicen.<br>

That I can speak in voice to ChatGPT App, and it speaks back to me, in an obscure language, and what it says is better - cleverer, more polite, more thoughtful - than 99% of humans - is beyond my wildest expectations. 🤯 Science Fiction made reality.

Ne go gledam 0-ili-1, go gledam kolicestvo na javnost, na pr. 3 varijanti: A) 1% javnost - jas sum Stalin, se odlucuvam sam, nikomu ne podnesuvam nikakvi smetki. Naredzenje-izvrsenje (tie sto ne slusaat sekoja vecer pravam spisok, nareduvam i gi strelaat vecerva), nikoj nisto ne znae osven tie sto izvrsuvaat; B) 50% javnost - na pr. kako vladite vo MK od 1991-va navamu vo nezavisna MK. Informacii protekuvaat celo vreme, nesto tocni nesto lazni, probuvam da drzam nesto pod kontrola, polovicno uspevam polovicno ne; C) 99% javnost - radikalna transparentnost, sekoj kompjuter na vlada i na drzavna administracija, se sto e pod gov dot mk zapisuva dokumenti samo i ekskluzivno na mrezen delen disk M: do koj ima pristap sekoj graganin na MK (kompjuterite nemaat lokalen disk, sekoj USB port e zatnat so lepak etc). Jas se nadevam deka varijanta C) ke raboti podobro od varijanta B). Ama se plasam deka ne e taka, deka varijanta B) dava podob rezultat od C). Znaeme deka B) raboti podobro od A), posto A) propadna samo od sebe, implodira vo 1990-ta posle 70 god praksa. Za finansiranje plakanje i sl - toa baska tema.<br>

Nie graganite - javnosta vo rabotenjeto ni dava ekstra sila, sto ja nemame koga se raboti se tajno. E taa sila - moze da ja koristime za dobro, ili za loso. Primetuvam koga se koristi loso posto mi odi kontra licnata ideologija :-) deka ni treba "radical transparency" (se sto e drzavna rabota da bide javno, na web, po default) za vladata i drzavata da rabotat podobro.

Yeah it's tad self serving: "I am a member of an elite that failed, but hey, don't blame us personally - anyone in our position would've failed too". While not great, in itself does not make the arguments invalid. But shocking to me, it managed through the whole series without defining what "information" and "knowledge" is. Starting with the title, "Ignorance" - well, we have excellent means to write down our ignorance, the degrees and the quantity of it - using the probability theory. Then there are hard definitions for "information" and "knowledge" since 1948. There is a unit of information ("bit"), the same way there is a unit of mass, or electric charge. Then there are extensions all the way to present time (incl "decisions under uncertainty" etc) that current AI crop (and its predecessors) were built on. This seems to be not known to @RoryStewartUK ?? Once one googles or spends time with Chatgpt learning on "Shannon Information theory", many things mentioned, wondered and mused on in this series - become less of a wonder. I don't know what to say, except that CP Snow's "The Two Cultures" problem is well alive and kicking. Esp given this whole series went through an entire process so it's not a single person single time fail - it's a larger group of people and over some considerable time.<br>

Yes - a mix of things. It's impossible to get into other people's heads, and even if we could, I doubt we will find anything there to explain it, as many people don't know themselves why they do things they do. At personal level it's vibes, but they serve a purpose: group formation.<br>

Each state has both the means and the duty and opportunity to defend itself online. UK gov should have the means to harness any volunteers goodwill (@Official_NAFO style, or @Reddit moderation) and channel it. It's all manual labour in the end, even with ChatGPT et all (b/c both the attack and the defence have access to the same tools).<br>

😂😂 Stay well in academia Prof. There are no "irrefutable arguments" for any system, incl PR. All systems make trade-offs. ChatGPT comes back with more reasonable assessment then yours I'm afraid:<br>
Accountability to Voters<br>
High: FPTP (direct link to representatives)<br>
Moderate: MMP (dual accountability)<br>
Low: PR, STV (weaker individual accountability due to party lists and multi-member constituencies)<br>
Proportionality in Representation<br>
High: PR, STV, MMP<br>
Moderate: AV<br>
Low: FPTP<br>
Transparency<br>
High: FPTP (simple process)<br>
Moderate: PR, MMP (complex but clear rules)<br>
Low: STV, AV (complex counting processes)<br>
And I'm sure you know but writing it for the benefit of any reader: political systems evolve, grow over time, to suit the political actors and balance their powers. Oft result of wars conflicts and blood spilled. If there ever was a Chesterton fence argument for anything - it's for the voting system. Be humble, assume to know little, don't change willy-nilly, and esp not b/c you think "I know better". I'm confident there is no politician at present willing to expand capital on this futile idea further. Hopefully the memory of 2011 is still with them and LDM laid to waste dissuade any takers. There is plenty of more important, more urgent work to be done, with multiple crisis abound. Any academics are welcome to do field work and uncover evidence from countries with different systems than UK, see what their users - voters (and also politicians etc; but esp *not* what the UK researcher) think of them, poss along the lines of https://x.com/mattpovey/status/1809216786740707594 .<br>

Ljubomir Josifovski @ljupc0<br>
Fair. To be slightly procedural: you disagree with "FPTP creates more accountability", but then you make an argument on representation "... by distorting representation". But the 2nd (representation) is not the same as the 1st (accountability). These are different dimensions we care about, different axis that we make compromises on. What quantity is gained in one quality, is lost in the other quality. I thought the ChatGPT summary was ok, spelling out the trade offs.<br>

"UK is comfortable" as in: we were given a Referendum on the issue in 2011, and we voted 2:1 to keep the existing FPTP in preference to changing to AV. That's not rubbish. And I would not call your opinions rubbish either. What you say is reasonable, but it's just made up stories: that majority want this or that, higher turnout, more "representative" (whatever it means for you) etc. This is something you hope for - but you have no evidence if it's going to turn out that way. If you have strong opinions, you owe it to yourself to read up on the topic . All voting systems have pros and cons. Here is a ChatGPT summary of the trade offs for you:<br>
Proportionality in Representation<br>
High: PR, STV, MMP<br>

FPTP has accountability going for it - there is a direct line voter-to-MP, we all know our representative by name. All other systems dilute that to some extent.<br>

Yes, we all find that objectionable, but: it does help creating stable governments. So it's a feature in addition to being a bug. :-) It's a clean break - one team is off the pitch, and a whole new team is out to play. All voting systems have pros-and cons- and make trade offs on the axis like accountability, representation, proportion, complexity, etc. I found excellent this contribution of a UK person living in NL and getting to know their system (and changing his opinion on the comparative pros-and-cons UK and NL it seems) https://x.com/mattpovey/status/1809216786740707594 . My voting experience actually matched what he described - I did it without thinking explicitly about it.<br>
FPTP has accountability going for it - there is a direct line voter-to-MP, we know our representative by name. Zero dilution of responsibility is I think a very good feature in this day and age. Other systems don't have that or don't have it to that extent.<br>
No system is perfect. I asked ChatGPT to summarize the pros- and cons- of different voting systems:<br>
Proportionality in Representation<br>
High: PR, STV, MMP<br>
Moderate: AV<br>
Low: FPTP<br>
Transparency<br>
High: FPTP (simple process)<br>
Moderate: PR, MMP (complex but clear rules)<br>
Low: STV, AV (complex counting processes)<br>
Accountability to Voters<br>
High: FPTP (direct link to representatives)<br>
Moderate: MMP (dual accountability)<br>
Low: PR, STV (weaker individual accountability due to party lists and multi-member constituencies)<br>

Ahhh  - thanks, tried now but need to subscribe.<br>
> Hello, I have a graph with joint probability z=f(x,y) 3d function graph, then a plane x=c which is the observed variable x to have value c cross section with the joint pdf f(x,y), and then the outline that is conditional probability f(y|x=c) which is rescaled f(x=c,y) with a scaler that is the marginal probability f(x) at point x=c. If I give you the graph plot picture, can you make it nicer, can you make it as if a sketch drawn by hand, but still retaining the significant features that I care about?<br>

<br>It does have downsides, but undemocratic is not the one I'd have thought to be the top of the list? Voting systems can be scored on various axis of qualities we care abut, they all have pros- and cons- and trade offs. ChatGPT summary - hope you don't mind :-)<br>

It's even better than that, you are underselling this if I may say. :-) That @geoffreyhinton 's very lucid observation was: while AI can explain a joke (why it's funny), it's very bad when it comes to writing a joke. B/c working out a good punch line requires planning in advance. AI starts writing what sounds like a joke, goes on for a few sentences, but then it comes up with the lamest of punchlines, b/c it has not pre-planned the punchline. It has to invent one in the last sentence, and there aren't good options at that point, it's too late.<br>

Consider quant finance/trading. Unlike 100% beauty contest academia, there is ~50% objective criterion if one is doing right/wrong (the rest being luck or the lack of it). SNR is low and data limited (unlike in AI), there is scope for prior knowledge, holds Bayes hope. (cope?)<br>

Never heard of these - todo lookup up. I'm keen on information theory and multi-dimensional space. Everything we do in information theory, now machine learning and AI, happens in many-to-millions dimensional spaces. In contrast, our intuitions are tuned to very low dimensional spaces, chiefly our 3-dimensional physical world. Just by observing the ratio of hyper- cube and ball, as N in N-dim increases, we get intuition of how our low-dim intuition may mislead us when thinking about high N-dimensional spaces (N>1e6): 1) the space moves into the corners and away from the middle as N increases 2) so measures of centrality (means etc) maybe less informative in high-N: they are not that representative given the low probability mass there 3) every observation becomes an outlier in some dimension when N is sufficiently high 4) does that imply we will observe the space as discrete rather than continuous? with every observation jumping from one corner to other corner of the space.<br>

Depends on the quality of the prediction. Imagine there was a parrot standing on your shoulder, and as you are trying to say something, the parrot says it, then again for the next word, the next one etc. 😁 The parrot guesses all the words you meant to say, completely accurately! Wouldn't you conclude that this is one smart parrot, that got into your head somehow, and knows you as well as you know yourself? If on the other hand the parrot never guesses a word, is alway wrong, and spouts gibberish - that's another matter completely. So the quality or lack of makes all the difference. Models atm don't have any grounding to the truths and falsehoods of our world, b/c all they get is some text. Once they are hooked to sensors and can observe for themselves - things may change.<br>

Not confined to politics and politicians exclusively. Similar is observed in music bands (contributes to the  "2nd album curse"), also with influencers and cultural entrepreneurs of all sorts. Once they try to 2nd guess and hit  on "what my audience wants" they typically decline. But not abruptly at once - it happens over time, takes time for the in-authenticity and deception to be imbibed by their audiences, almost by osmosis. There is not an one big reveal. A dynamics similar to enshitification of social media platform popularized by @doctorow<br>
 it seems to me - possibly related.<br>

 ELI5-ed our banking system to me enough to not be bamboozled.<br>
The Landscape of Money (Part 1): State money, bank money & plug-in institutions by Brett Scott We sometimes hear the term 'fiat money', and get told that it's issued by states. States, though, are but one part of the modern fiat money system, which also includes commercial banks who issue their own form of money, and various institutions like Paypal that 'plug-in' to the banking sector. In this video I sketch out a broad overview of the state money system, bank money system, and payments system, whilst touching on controversial topics like 'fractional reserve banking' (credit creation of money), central bank digital currencies (CBDC's), and the 'War on Cash'. This video is Part 1 of a three-part series: the next video will go into the cryptocurrency systems that claim to challenge this fiat money system<br>

It's the logic of a continental empire where "more land == better". As opposed to say maritime empire where "more commerce == better". We've not seen one recently - since the demise of Austro-Hungarian and the Ottoman empires. That mode of operation is how Russian Empire became so large by land span too. After the communist experiment failure it's not illogical for Putin to go back to the previous functioning mode of op. The novel 21st century twist (also ushered in with the communist experience) is the negation of any possibility for objective truth (Surkov & co). Merciless lying in industrial quantities - even when near term there's no need for it - is by design, to destroy any possibility to any truth. Note the contrast: US didn't deny they're going to invade Iraq, they were trying to manufacture reasons for. While Russia denied they are going to invade Ukraine (even while invading it). Similarly previously they denied they took Crimea - the "green man".<br>

As a civilian bystander: to me seems MMT is only profound b/c the rest of the Econ profession seems hell bent on digging themselves into ever deeper hole by somehow thinking that accounting identities don't apply to them or that "fiat" (as in "by decree") is somehow up for discussion. Your claim on the IR is a perfect illustration. If UK gov incl BoE wanted to "widow make BoJ style" - they could. Other "bad things" may happen (weak pound importing inflation?), but IR being set at a BoE meeting (and markets can take a hike) is the reality. Feel free to dislike that and use flowery metaphors to obscure that to your hearts content. You're not doing yourself any favors tbh. What's once seen, can't be unseen. That rabbit is out the hat. Professional more general observation: the proven fact that economists forecast notoriously lack any predictive power (they do worse than "forecast == last observed value") while plenty of others (humanities majors including literature and history, electrical engineers, mathematicians, CompSci, etc) make $$$ and living betting on the markets but economics profession as whole does not and media-macro serves as infotainment circus clowns makes me prejudiced against anything economists say when it comes to money $$$. On the "producing stuff" they do much better - imo they should stick to the "stuff" part of the "stuff-for-$$$" exchange. They seems to have a blind spot for the $$$ part.<br>

Ofc trade secrets are not patents - they remain secret. :-) In return - I'd expect to be a lot less protection in law for them. Industrial R&D results were usually a) trade secrets; or b) patents, until this latest trend in AI-ML where a lot is also c) published in journals. I love that option (c)! Spilling (most of) the beans freely for the widest possible gain. :-) Previously I was in industrial R&D lab where most was (b) patented, but now I'm in quant trading R&D where there is zero of that and is all (a) trade secrets.<br>

Like if the number of COs was in millions, to the point of the nation not being able to organize an army and defend itself, two things can happen: 1) rules get changed so the COs number is reduced and the nation defends itself in the war and survives; or 2) the nation is defeated, taken over by the foe nation that had different rules (ones facilitating fielding an army). Either way - new rules survive that keep the number of COs low as to the defense of the nation is possible. Why not zero COs? It's too much of an effort for not a lot of gain as long as enough of non-COs are available to serve. Allowing for small non-zero number of COs is a positive for the legitimacy of the rest of the recruitment process too.<br>

Unfortunately for all - not anytime soon and certainly not before a military defeat. Even elected politicos stumble on a "worse is better" +ve feedback loop, they discover it by trial&error (US Trump now, UK BoJo previously, I observed it personally in YU'90s), the steps are: 1) Identify a grievance, a fissure, something that hurts 2) praise the wound open, drill in, make it hurt more 3) campaign on that pain, get elected 4) do not heal the wound - on the contrary, make it worse & more painful 5) come next election - accuse your enemies of (a) causing the pain (b) preventing you from healing the wound 6) get elected by a bigger majority. Repeat the cycle. For a king-for-life like Putin now it's even more advantageous - permanent war secures the throne no questions asked. War is much easier much simpler for a king to do than say a slow betterment of the country.<br>

I look at Putin's conscript army and think - not a good idea. Ideals you cherish and trust you crave are instilled by transparency, honesty, good deeds in public life. Semi-enslaved labor may divide our society further and the young-old gap already showing may grow into a a chasm. There is volunteering and charity work available now. Conflating army with helping old grannies is a misdirection that ill serves us. Army service is not weekend creche, soldiers are not kids. Their job is to kill people they have never met before and have personally nothing against. They are given training and equipment by the state and social permission by the society to do so. It's not volunteering - people that refuse it in peace time are jailed, and in war time they are shot. When imagining possibilities, thinking of the best case is going easy on yourself. We'd be better off if you'd steelman your argument. Imagine king Boris Johnson having at his beck and call fully trained well armed competent 2M soldiers strong army. To me the present reality where King BoJo lacks the means to indulge his exuberant fantasies seems better.<br>

If it's not military - than it's not a national service really as far as I understand it. There is volunteering and charity work available now. Imo professional army is way better investment. Better to enlarge that one than waste resource on conscripts. I think conflating army with helping old grannies is a misdirection that ill serves us.

It's not volunteering - people that refuse it in peace time are jailed, and in war time they are shot. I did 1yr national service at 18yo. Only really useful thing there was I got to observe a cross-section of society I wouldn't have observed otherwise. Saw many functionally illiterate, dumb to the point of being danger to themselves, people, as well as a small share of truly evil psychopaths, but also good, honest and rare brilliant guys. Made me appreciate the role of selection as well as education. Also prob got a foretaste how life maybe if I ever find myself imprisoned. Other than that, as in actual war fighting skills - it was a total waste of time. It convinced me that any conscript army will be routed by a professional foe in a real war.<br>

I did 1yr national service at 18 and I'm not in favor of it. It seemed like waste of time. I learned ~1.5 useful things. The full 1 point - got to observe a cross-section of society I wouldn't have observed otherwise. Saw many functionally illiterate, dumb to the point of being danger to themselves, people, as well as a small share of trully evil psychopaths, but also good, honest and rare brilliant guys. Made me appreciate the role of selection as well as education. And 0.5 half-point is - got a foretaste how life maybe if I ever find myself imprisoned. Professional army is way better investment.

Dumping them in the rubbish bin will not force insolvency, no? 😄 And if you take them to the Fed/Treasury - the Fed can always create new $$$ on their spreadsheet (no shortage of numbers there) and exchange your bonds for $$$ that it will credit your Reserve Account with. Afaik any insolvency can only be voluntary: The Fed - or Treasury, or ultimately the USG - to voluntarily decide not to honor them and default on them. Other bad things may happen (or not) with the extra $$$ in your reserve account. Just involuntary insolvency is not one of those things.<br>

In systematic quant trading hedge funds we use somewhat specialized forecasting - we forecast returns. There is ton of data dredging, development, research - forecasting is part but it's not the whole thing. Also in systematic forecasting there's no human in the loop - only code.<br>

Da - imame familii rodnini i prijateli i mozebi imot, znaci imame nekoj interes ne e deka ne ne interesira, ama - toa ne e dovolno. Dijaspora e ok da ima nekoj pasos nekakva vrska so maticnata zemja, ama deka ne treba da glasa i ne treba mnogu da se mesa vo tekovna politika. Idea vodilka kako da se reguliraat odnosite so dijaspora treba da e - edinstvo. (na pr grckata dijaspora taka e nekako organizirana) Kako sto e sega MK dijaspora - em ne-edinstvoto od MK se preleva vo dijasporata, em dijasporata negativno vlijane na maticata vo MK i pridonesuva za dodatni razdori. Generalno - pomalku zborenje poveke rabota za nas dijasporci.

Kolku razbiram, opasnosta e ovaa. Namerata na BG e da gi natera so milo ~500K-600K makedonci da stanat bugari preku razni povlastici. Kako i dosega so EU pasosi - iako nikoj od niv ne se pisuva i na popis BG-in (ama gledas imase reakcii od BG "kade se tie so BG-ski pasosi, sto gi nema"). Utre so davanje 300 Eur na popis, na pr. Mozebi so kvalitetno bugarsko osnovno i sredno skolo, mozebi i fakultet vo BG. Verojatno imaat i drugi nacini +vno da deluvaat (za niv). Otkako ke se napravi podloga za vlijanie - ke ima i politicki baranja. Racunam ultimativno BG ideal e - MK da pobara pripojuvanje kon BG.<br>
So voenite zlostornici nema takva opasnost. So GR i severna isto nemase. Kvalitetno sredno skolo ima tursko Jahja Kemal - ama decata nema da gi preobrati vo turci i sl (golema e distancata makedonec do turcin).<br>
Dodatno - kolku podolgo BG ja blokira MK, tolku poveke gorniot plan se realizira. Po primerot so BG pasosi - kolku podolgo MK ne e vo EU, tolku poveke MK-ci zemaat BG pasos. Da bese MK vo EU - nieden MK-ec nemase da vadi BG pasos. Pa taka BG ima motiv, im e vo korist, nikogas da ne ja odblokiraat MK. Posto kolku podolgo, tolku poveke MK-ci ke stanuvaat BG-ri.<br>
Ne kazuvam deka taka ke bide, ne mozam da vidam vo idninata ne znam - kazuvam mozebi toa e BG planot.<br>
Lekot za MK (i za WB6) e - ne priem vo EU (toa ne e mozno sega), tuku dil kako Shvajcarija: priem vo Schengen zona, ostvaruvanje na 4-slobodi, priem vo zednicki paza i verojatno carinskata zona. Ako mozat MK-cite da rabotat i ziveat slobodno vo EU - nema da imaat potreba ni od EU priem niti od BG pasos. Ova @rumeliobserver dobro go artikulira vo https://esiweb.org/proposals/offer-four-freedoms-balkans-ukraine-and-moldova .<br>
Ne znam nisto za BG politika znam kolku e realen planot opisan pogore. No delot so BG pasosi bese staven vo pogon i se ostvaruva(se?). Mu veruvam na @rumeliobserver , mene scenarioto mi lici verojatno. Citajki sto pisuvaat i pro-zapadno orientirani liberalni BG-ri so simpatii kon nas kako @DimitarBechev , mi lici tie uste se vo filmot od pred-1991 deka "MK-cite se tvorba na Tito, sega ke se setat deka se BG-ri i ke se vratat kon maticata".

Impossible to quantify plus covariates => equal weight, but you need more factors. Add -<br>
1) UK had macro-illiterate austerity of Dave & George  2010+, US has had Big Fiscal, BBB, IRA.<br>
2) UK is super centralized. If UK treasury (FinMin) says NO to a project, then that's it. And this can happen even after the Parliament voted for it. (with a weak PM lacking clear mandate b/c not won an election)<br>
3) There is not a 2nd big agglomeration with revenue raising authority (yet; maybe ~Manchester~ in the future?) competing with London that can vary policy and try things different.<br>

Sometimes I needle some of them with - "econ phd academia midwits doomer decels". 😆 Bit harsh, but to the civilians like me usually their message comes over as "Taxman raids pubs' cash registers after closing time at midnight to get the gold coins needed to pay police & nurses tomorrow".<br>
Atm "there is no $$$" is used to cover with a patina of respectability laziness, lack of ambition, NoCanDo-attitude . Easier to sit on the hands or chin-stroke & do nothing then work & build. Excuses "why not" are plentiful and come easily. At a country level, the whole country e.g. UK enters a stasis.<br>
Example from today - https://twitter.com/PranMan/status/1774251583754146072 . So India 2024 can, UK in 1900s could, but UK 2024 can't??<br>
Obv UK can do it in 2024 too. But smooth brains spreadsheet bin counters at @hmtreasury went from bad"we cannot afford anything" to worse "we cannot build anything". Cue HS2 cancellation. "Good servant but bad master" comes to mind. There's a reason why FinMin should *not* run the country but serve the country.<br>
In contrast - the challengers to status quo like MMTers strike me as as booster chads. 😂 Create! JustDoIt! GetThingsDone!<br>

IDK, you'd have to express the above in maths symbols I'm afraid. In my mind, say p(x,y) is the p.d.f. capturing quantifying all that is known about the (x,y) relationship. Entropy == amount of our ignorance (the opposite of knowledge) == the amount of flatness (the opposite of spikeness) of the pdf p(x,y). A new data point coming in and us updating p(x,y) to incorporate the new observation, may increase or decrease the entropy measure, so new information may increase or decrease our knowledge, e.g. c.f. "How to  measure the information gained from one symbol" https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0954-898X/10/4/303 . And expand from there.<br>

I'm no proponent but it's trivially easy to see that their description of the fiat currency system is true to the present reality. Other notice that too - libertarians, BoE whitepaper "Money Creation in the Modern Economy", Greenspan, cryptos etc. Economists are uniquely ill prepared for anything to do with money though: their discipline is about producing real stuff we all consume or use, which is many orders of magnitudes harder. By comparison the tokens or spreadsheet cells used to facilitate exchange of said stuff are trivial in almost every aspect. Banking is 1st and foremost law, then accounting, then IT and at distant 4th only related to economics.<br>

Posto dobavuvackiot lanec (supply chain) e podolg koga uvezuvame, pogolem e rizikot da bide prekinat (na pr vojni i sl), i deka hranata nema da stigne i ke ostaneme gladni. Na pr.

So ekstra danok i stranskiot ke stane skap kolku domasniot. Istoto primeneto na site proizvodi (posto grav neli ne e nekoj isklucok) - znaci se ke platite poskapo, standardot malku ke vi opadne. Toa imase vo socijalizmot - uvozot bese kontroliran,  ogranicen, odanocen i sl. Vo takvi uslovi nekade uspea da se razvie domasno proizvodstvo (Slovenija), a nekade ne se razvi: ni posle 45 god zastita ne uspeaa domasnite proizvodi da stanat konkurentni na stranskite po cena-kvalitet. Toa e vecna dilema kolkav odnos zastita-konkurencija e optimalen za proizvoditeli-i-potrosuvaci. Ima razlicni mislenja. Od edna krajnost "23 Things They Don't Tell You About Capitalism" pa do drugata "Open: The Story Of Human Progress". Jas mislam - zavisi od lugeto, od organizacijata na tie luge, od zemjata, geografijata, istorijata etc dali i sto ke uspee ili ne.

Instead of trying to unpack - this by @Suitpossum maybe worth your time https://youtube.com/watch?v=mmWOO7r_NMw&t=6m30s .  (apology for offering unsolicited opinion - will be the last time I do) Afaik this description of how our fiat system works is correct. I personally find abstracting spreadsheets instead of rings drawn in the video as understandable, but rings are visually way more appealing. ☺️ Shortest summary: Level 1 - Central Bank (BoE) owning and operating a spreadsheet with 1) current/reserve (current, 0 interest) and 2) gilts/bonds (savings, 5.25% interest) accounts for the commercial UK banks (Barclays, Lloyds etc).  Level 2 - Every commercial UK bank owning and operating their own spreadsheet each, with 1) current (0 interest) and 2) saving (>0% interest) for me and yourself, their customers.<br>

And one of their questions was: and what QSAR did you use? so he said: what's QSAR? Now QSAR is a field - it's got a journal, it has conferences, it's been going for many years, and it's a field of Quantitative Structural Activity Relationships. That's the field that tries to predict whether some chemical is going to bind to something. And basically he wiped out that field, without knowing its name."<br>

👏 +1 For the quantity->quality angle aka "more is different". ☺️  We've all mused abt "how much residual variance justifies this extra dimension?" but then stop there & never connect the dots... 😁🤯 For networks - connections scaling with N^2 esp make the sizing angle pertinent.<br>

Given that both regression and classification ("train (fit) on full data (X,Y), at test time I will show you present X, your task is to guess missing Y") can be considered to be cases of missing data ("observed present X, did not observe missing Y"), one can sympathize that's it's almost impossible to teach it with any consistency. One has to almost use the latter/advanced part of the course to explain MD (and treatment) at the very start of the course?? Don't envy your task at all.<br>

Aka - more is different, enough quantity is new quality. Amusingly in ML we decide to chop-off extra dimensions after PCA on the account of "the amount of variance is not big enough" (to warrant extra dimension i.e. new quality). With PCA the criterion is "linear transform vanishes the quantity along that quality/dimension". In general we are looking at "general computer program vanishing the extra dimension by predicting it" or articulating the same in terms of "compression".<br>

Yeah - MSM will fail for any basic trick repeatedly, they are real gluttons for that. After all the talk of misinformation, they still go forth and amplify for the 101-st time the source that lied 100 times before. RUS dis/info tactics of "flood the field with sh*t" i.e. lie mercilessly in industrial quantities with the strategic goal of annihilating even the possibility of "the truth" existing seems to get them. NB while swallowing it all they still scrupulously maintaining plausible deniability with "... X said so and so". So there must be at some level some doubt about the truth of their reporting.<br>

That's one factor (quality), not the only one. Next step is to quantify that and other factors (qualities), so to be able to compute derive (aggregate/marginalize/average) non-obvious theses that require quantified chain of reasoning. Exemplified by http://rooclaim.com e.g. https://rootclaim.com/analysis/What-is-the-source-of-COVID-19-SARS-CoV-2<br>
 and applicable to any investigation. Works anywhere we collect always imperfect evidence and have to weight competing explanations. I'm surprised this is not mandatory training for at least judges if not all barristers and solicitors too! Numeracy FTW!! :-) Unsurprisingly it's not that complicated while it's incredibly useful and Bayes gets a mention somewhere too. ;-)<br>

Uh-oh, too much like rerun of 1938+ history there, impossible to not notice. Expansionist European power with a galaxy sized grievance, annexing the nearby regions 1st, then gobbling up the whole country, on the pretext of taking care of its kin + feeling threatened. Western security guarantees impossible to discharge but impossible to ignore either - for fear that the reminder of the alliances will crumble. Once RU switcheroo to war economy is complete it will look to "where next?". All this is already in motion. One way to short circuit the rolling disaster maybe CEEu countries developing nuclear deterrent? But they don't seem to think so. Worse - some like HU think they will be at the dining table (seems they accepted some RU offer, maybe the one that PL declined), rather than being the meal served (whereas the latter is more likely tbh). What is to be done?<br>

Yes - so that's an argument against. I believe this is an argument that proponents of Job Guarantee (JG) make. On the other hand - it maybe less of a yes/no question, more a "how much" question. So if UBI was £10 pcm - probably noone would mind. If it was £10K pcm - that would obviously be a disaster.<br>
We already have not-quite-but-almost-Universal Basic Income for 1) old people (old age pension) 2) people with cash savings (interest rate) 3) people in work on low wages (similar to negative tax?) 4) very young people (children benefit). For these too - it's a question of level, of quantity, not of quality (whether we do them yes/no). Don't think any UBI would be that much different in that respect.<br>
I am concerned that without the ultimate threat of "you will die" it might be impossible to make people cooperate in large numbers (when they decide they don't want to). So that freedom maybe good for each of us (individuals) that increases my personal power, but may destroy society (the group) whose power it decreases. I doubt there is a an easy or complete solution, would expect to be more a series of imperfect compromises that avoid the worst.<br>

@rumeliobserver Ima dobra poenta ovde: ne e se do MK, posto ako bese samo do MK, ke imase napredok vo pregovori so nekoja druga zemja od WB. Posto nema napredok so niedna zemja od WB, zaklucok konkretno momentalno ne e do WB (ni do MK). EU se otvori za novi clenki posle 1999-ta otkako Germanija+Francija se uplasija od vojnata na Kosovo.

We don't learn from history so we're bound to repeat it. We'll be "lucky" if it stays conventional and not go nuclear. Courtesy of LLMs -<br>
Key events leading up to and during the early stages of World War II, particularly focusing on German and Soviet expansion.<br>
German Expansion:<br>
1936: Germany reoccupies the Rhineland in violation of the Treaty of Versailles.<br>
1938: Germany annexes Austria (Anschluss) and the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia following the Munich Agreement.<br>
1939: Germany invades Poland, prompting Britain and France to declare war, marking the beginning of World War II.<br>
Soviet Expansion:<br>
1939: The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact is signed between Germany and the Soviet Union, secretly dividing Eastern Europe into spheres of influence.<br>
1939: The Soviet Union invades Finland, leading to the Winter War.<br>
1940: The Soviet Union annexes parts of Romania.<br>
1940: The Soviet Union invades and occupies the Baltic states (Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania).<br>
These events illustrate the geopolitical developments and aggressions that set the stage for the broader conflict of World War II. The Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, in particular, played a significant role in shaping the early stages of the war by redistributing territories in Eastern Europe.<br>

😆😆 Ok, it maybe cheesy, but is it untrue? That the chances are that today, this particular day, is not that turning point. I am not disputing that it happens - I'm saying chances are against it happening  today (when I conveniently happened to think about this stuff). For us to have that much meta-knowledge, knowledge-about-other-knowledge, not only that something new will be discovered but also the timing of it - that would be indeed incredibly useful. But I've seen no evidence that we have any handle there (and plenty that we don't). I don't disagree that we 1) learn (science) then 2) exploit (technology) and then 3) that well runs dry and we have to dig another one. Re-search is mostly directed re-peated-search for something that works. Impossible to tell if or when something will work out in advance. In academia & industrial research always thought project/funding proposals "we will do X and figure out Y" were fools errand, a waste of bits. Physicists thought there is little left to discover in physics at the start of the 20c. (e.g. - "diminished returns"). Then a decade latter nuclear and quantum stuff (smallest of sizes) and relativity (largest of sizes) happened that ushered our current age of the atom, the micro-electronics, and space exploration.<br>

Excellent - hits the nail on the head. Yeah, competition and -ve feedback loop is fine and dandy and may lead to improvement via error correction. However - it's only 1/2 of the group relations. The remaining 1/2 is +ve feedback - cooperation, coordination, agreement, working pulling the weight together. Competition is most useful at deciding what the group should do, formulating a plan. To execute the plan and get things done - the group needs cooperation and coordination.<br>

Yeah - true that, much depends on the EM ambitions for TW. Fwiw conflict between advertisers' interests and the publisher, esp when adv dislikes pub content, and especially when pub is critical of the adv on the same pages where adv advertises (and this supports the pub) - is the oldest conflict in publishing industry. :-) Little new under the sun. Maybe the novelty here is  frenemies push-pull angle free speech v.s. moderation. Every online platform stumbles onto moderation (different to censorship). Looks X is walking the well trodden path albeit twists&turns on the way. This https://twitter.com/ErrataRob/status/1730300012058362335 addresses some, and @yishan had a good thread on the same at the time of EM TW purchase. I thought EM had a plan to use ML of some sort (sth like ChatGPT is now) to scale up the moderation. Only way at scale - otherwise all manually impossible to moderate TW.<br>

As anyone who has ever been responsible for legislative oversight of central bankers knows, they do not like to have their authority challenged. Most of all, they will defend their mystique—that magical aura that hovers over their words, shrouding a slushy mix of banality and baloney in a mist of power and jargon. As a result, tormenting central bankers is great fun. John Maynard Keynes famously tormented Montagu Norman, Governor of the Bank of England (BOE) from 1920 to 1944. Wright Patman and Henry Reuss, two US congressmen who chaired the House Banking Committee in the 1970s, did the same to Federal Reserve Chair Arthur Burns. I know that Reuss enjoyed it; I assisted him at the time.<br>

TBF looks like LLMs have reached the level of intuition, but not the one of reasoning, as delineated by the excellent https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/1719455623799357888 . A big step improvement on prior best - but will have wait another 10-15 years for the next jump to reasoning probably.<br>

Amazing - a case for psychologists. Looks similar to a narcissists' playbook ("that didn't happen; & if it did, it wasn't that bad; & if it was, it's not a big deal; & if it is, it's not my fault & some big boys made me do it & I didn't mean it; & if I did it, you deserved it; & if you don't shut up about it, I'll do it again") but somehow the deed and the post-hoc justification are with separate individuals.<br>

Thanks! Is it 1) "fixed" supply (nuclear, some gas) pre-ordered, price fixed, pre-paid is not part of the rolling auction; leaving the 2) "variable" supply (to match variable demand) to participate. And for that portion wind supplied enough Quantity to be a Price setter. Nice. 😀<br>

Interesting to learn that most people don't create an account in any and all platforms, just in case, even as a dormant one, even if it's free, after the initial create effort also does not tax my time or attention.

Probably the Research part of R&D achieved internally, so they're 100% sure it can be done. Probably 6 months for the D part, incl h/w for the users/cusomers (given they sell a service). E.g. see how inference compute power req increased suddenly x10-x100 with reasoning in o1 vs. LM gpt4.<br>

My reading is: initially size was necessary given the lack of sufficient compute, lack of large quantity and good quality data. Now with improvements on all axis - ever more compute, more and better data, they manage to squeeze much much more in the weights. Excellent news indeed. :-)<br>
