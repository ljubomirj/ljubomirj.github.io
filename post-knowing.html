        <h1>Knowing - what do I mean when I say I know something</h1>

        <p>I was told "the joint probability density function between two variables X and Y captures all there is ever to be known about the relation between them" 25 years ago (Â¡Hola! <a href="https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mcarreira-perpinan/">Miguel</a> :-)), and it's been a blessing and a curse. Blessing - yeah joint pdf \( f_{X,Y}(x,y) \) does capture everything. Curse - often I read an article and think of the author "wish someone told you too".</p>

        <p>Example below illustrates the point on the example of a joint pdf \( p = f_{X,Y}(x,y) \) that is a mix of two Gaussians in 2D space \( (x,y) \). Then we observe the variable \( X \) and the observations is \( x=1 \). That is equivalent to the joint pdf being cut by the plane \( x=1 \).</p>
        <p>The intersection of the joint pdf \( p = f_{X,Y}(x,y) \) and the plane \( x=1 \) is \( f_{X,Y}(x=1,y) \) and is the best description of how the model \( f_{X,Y})(x,y) \) is affected by the observation \( x=1 \). That intersection \( f_{X,Y}(x=1,y) \) is outlined below. It is a function that is a scaled conditional \( f_{X,Y}(x=1,y) = f_Y(y|x)f_X(x=1) \), where the the conditional pdf is \( f_Y(y|x) \), and the scaler \( f_X(x=1) \) is the marginal pdf \( f_X(x) \) of \( X \) at point \( x=1 \).</p>
        <p>The marginal pdf \( f_X(x) \) is computed from the joint pdf \( f_{X,Y}(x,y) \) by marginalization, by integrating out \( Y \) as \( f_X(x) = \int f_{X,Y}(x,y)\,dy \) and then plugging in \( x=1 \).</p>
