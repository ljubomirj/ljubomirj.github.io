        <h1>Social Networks</h1>
        <p>I spend a lot of time reading (and sometimes posting) on various Social Networks. I have been on the Internet from the very start of it existing and being available. Prior to Internet, I used home made Bulletin Board Systms (BBS) and computer networks like DECnet, X.25, BITNET, etc.</p>
        <p>My understandign of how a social network like X/Twitter works is as follows.</p>
<p>
For example. I follow 5000 accounts. Each account writes about 1 post a day = 5000 posts a day. Every time I login to X and check X for new posts, the X algofeed serves me 50 posts on one screenfull. I check X 10 times per day, 10 times x 50 posts per a screenfull  = 500 posts that X will show me daily. That is 500 posts, out of the total of 5000 eligible posts that can be shown. The other 4500 eligible posts will not be shown. X must decide which 500, out of 5000 possible, to show me. Any one post has probability 0.1 to be shown. So I expect to see 1 post from 1 account once in 10 days. X algo is non-random and tilts towards factors like accounts interaction - engagement with posts {Like,Forward,Quote,Reply}, bio check, time of posting, where the timeliness is decayed by some time half-life. Chiefly seems like the most important meta-data is (a) connection (follow/s/er); and (b) timeliness, time of viewing minus time of posting (that decays quickly). The Algofeed has no idea about the meaning or truthfulness of them. Afaik the Algofeed has mostly meta-data only to go on, when deciding which post to push onto millions of user screens. Meta-data that's chiefly - Engagement (other users reactions), and Timeliness (with short half life).
</p>
<p>
Algofeed using meta-data mostly strikes me as being "judged on the color of your skin" phase of the Social Netwrok-s, and would be good to transition to "judged on the content of the character", of each and every one of the posts (and downstream - users). :-)
</p>
<p>
Not having an algofeed is physically impossible. This is not only X but all social media - FB, IG, TikTok, TG, etc. This is how it works. The Algofeed is moderates every user experience every second. There is not a moment that we the users don't get it.
</p>
<p>
I heard this metaphor/abstraction by Yuval Harari recently. The algofeed deciding which 500 posts I see today out of smaller selection of 5000 (out of total of 1B possible per day) is an editor (even if automated), and X is a publisher (even if automated). The users are readers are also writers creating content without commission or pay. I don't see how X (and FB, TikTok etc) are not media companies (as opposed to - a point to point carrier of signals). They are even selling and living off adverts! :-) (mostly; X not so much nowdays)
</p>
<p>
Advbertising. In non-social one-to-many media the adverts are broadcast to all. So if there is a falsehood or slander in an advert - evetyone can see it, then provide feedback and critique. In social media (e.g. FB) one-to-one advitising is completely private. Every one use may be shown a (a) separate different advert; and (b) completely untruthful, but there is no way for anyone else to know. The advert is 1:1 between the user and the platform, completely secret. Platforms should be required to provide access to the adverts they serve to a third party. Ideally - adverts should be available for inspection by all users at all times, and in an online archive too with the historic adverts there too.
</p>
<p>
I got enrolled at some point (not sure why - I vaguely remember X offered, and I agreed) in the Community Notes programme on X. I get to vote on Community Notes others have written. And also to add notes for others to vote on - but have not done that yet.
Someone explained that the logic/istics behind is: find sufficient group of people that disagree on other issues, but agree on the note, for the note to be published. That strikes me as valuable insight. I'm surprised how well it works. Have to look up again the maths, the linear algebra of it - there was some SVD involved.
It's good, but it's wholly insufficient for a network flooded with falsehoods on an industrial scale. While the notes are being submitted and voted on, the Algofeed pushes the Post onto millions of screens. Then after a week, a Note is ready and published. From now on, it will be shown together with the original post - good. If I clicked Like or Repost, I will get a Notification that a Note appeared - good. However - millions of people that merely viewed the original post when the algofeed pushed it onto ther screen - they will never see the Note.
It's the Social Network equivalent to an old style Newspaper correction. A false story is splashed on the front page for millions to read. Then a week latter, Correction appears deep on page 23, that few read. Good that it happens - but insufficient.

As with other things, in social netwroks too: incentives -> results.
Engagement is maximized when 1/2 of users are at the throats of the other 1/2, and that's exactly the result we got. Took time but we are reaching that destination.
I want to get 1000 Feeds, incl some user defined, instead of the medieval choice of 2 - "For you" and "Following". But that's not going to happen. X went wide did Communities, some way towards conference style (current leader in that is Reddit), instead of deep improving the quality of their core product.
Another thing I want to see is RealHuman flag, and I'd pay small one off fee for that. And then to be able to filter on that flag (or not). That's not going to happen either.
TBH IDK why Musk bought Twitter only to leave it to rot. Afaics nothing is improving with my user experience.
Switch to a new platform is but impossible b/c it's a collective action problem *and* needs to happen at the same time in a short time window. Only external event can force that, c.f. Brazil ban.
Best one can do in the mean time is replicate their Social Graph, find their Follows and Followers, on alternative platforms. There will be insufficient traffic there. The "public Square N^2 iron law of network value" ensures the biggest network wins every time. Posts are like a flowing water, are quickly re-created, and most are time-events-sensitive anyway, non transplantable in content. So having your Social Graph at the ready on an alternative place is half the job done. And prudent too. It's free no reason not to reserve your favourite user nickname on Bsky or similar.

Doubt anyone is coming after the Algofeed - but someone should. S230 I am happy to (effectively) protect me, and other humans, and also X from me. However, S230 should not protect X Algofeed, as it's not a Human, from shoving insane dross onto 100M screens daily. Engagement is maximized when 1/2 is at the throats of the other 1/2, and that's exactly the result we got. Sick of that's sh*t. Years pass there's been minimal improvement in my Algofeed experience. Only change I remember was For you and Following separation. That part of the Social network monopoly I hate. No idea how to incentivise X to give me better choice there, I want a choice of 1000s of Feeds. They are asleep at the wheel. Maybe a kick in the backside, some stick is needed to shake things a bit in that space.

I read an explainer on the state of the play, the history, the dilemmas, the legal issues, and including the most recent US court rulings that maybe relevant (or not) for the future by <a href="https://x.com/matthewstoller">@matthewstoller</a> at <a href="https://thebignewsletter.com/p/judges-rule-big-techs-free-ride-on">https://thebignewsletter.com/p/judges-rule-big-techs-free-ride-on</a>.
