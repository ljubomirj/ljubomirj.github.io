        <h1>Twitter surviving - personal considerations, tips, practices</h1>

        <p>This is a write down of how I (think I) use X (formerly Twitter). This is not - how to be popular, or how to be an influencer, or how to get a flock of followers. Even to the contrary - these are probably anti-patterns if your are aiming for fame & fortune.</p>

        <p>These are written down what I think are my personal tips, previously unwritten guidelines, my own practices, of how I use X. I have gotten a lot out of X! There are many people that complain about all manner of things - but many many more that don't. The number of interesting things, links, discussions out there - is mind boggling. By SNR - it's way way better than the forums of old. I think - I put a only a little more effort than the minimal (abour zero), to gain a whole lot more out of X. Same goes for Bsky. By default - both are pretty bland. But - put some effort in aggressivelly shaping your Follows-Followers, blocking and muting the worst offenders accounts (to whatever your taste is), muting words (esp related to some event - politics elections, football tournaments, etc), adding accounts to thematic personal List-s, and you may see disproportionate returns. There are interesting things out there - but they are like small fish in a humongous ocean. A very low probabbility finds. So like a gambler tilting the odds of fortuna ever so slightly to his advantage at every opportunity - do try to shift the otherwise unfavourable odds, make them be little less so.</p>

        <p>Lately I notice similar usage patterns developing in my Bsky usage. Given there is only X and Bsky, and what was Twitter is now X, I will use the term the "Twitter" as a generic term to refer to both of them. Think possibly Mastodon is similar enough that it can be encompassed too. In the furture - hopefully other networks too. The format seems general enough to be own genre. A social media network, primary text-based read/write, with short public posts as default, where posts can be considered minimal units of messaging, quantas of ideas.</p>

        <p>X - tips, guidelines, my practices.</p>

        <ol type="a">
			<li>On mobile use browser <a href="https://x.com/home">https://x.com/home</a> or X app, <a href="https://bsky.app/">https://bsky.app/</a> or Bsky app. A browser tab is better than an App insofar one can open many tabs, with many views, while the App is only ever a single view. Further, better to use open web standards, and avoid using closed walled garden App-s where possible. What's used lives and develops, what's not used dies off.</li>
            <li>On desktop use XPro <a href="https://pro.x.com">https://pro.x.com</a> <a href="#" onclick="toggleShowImage('xpro-decks-lists-comms-1234')">Tweetdeck</a> and deck.blue <a href="https://deck.blue/">https://deck.blue/</a> <a href="#" onclick="toggleShowImage('deck-blue-2')">decks</a>. Default to LISTS deck, check Personal, and only dive into individual lists when time to spare.</li>

        </ol>

        <p>TL curating, dual aim: maximize SNR, maximize interaction. Assume value comes from connections between nodes.</p>
        <p>Expected hit rate ~1% for minimal interaction (Like) that carries zero risk cost to the reader when reading a post user wrote.</p>
        <p>Rules of thumb - break them with a reason, but not without.</p>

        <ol type="1">
        <li>
       Accounts to follow: any that seem interesting, notable, authors of books, videos, blog posts, podcasts etc you have already read, heard, watched.<br>
       If recognize the name or the face => follow. Those that are real people - select +Notify on them to be reminded of their existing.
        </li><br>

        <li>
       Follow back everyone that follows you as a default, to start with. Give the possibility of interaction a chance (even if it's a small one).
       Exceptions are obvious spam accounts: elonmuskXXX, phishingXXX, celebrityXXX, influencerXXX, cryptoXXX, tradeXXX, casinoXXX, girlXXX, motivationalXXX.
       Don't follow obvious trolls, fakes, pseudoanons that are high volume general posters unless thematic (technology, science) that is of personal interest.
       When deciding - "should I follow or not?" - the question asked is: will I like to see this user posts in the future? Have a best guess - yes or no?
       Look at the combined total of info available to you, forecast a) is the user a real human? b) will I want to read posts from them?

<pre><code>
       Info:      1-pic   2-namesurname     3-bluecheck                \     / Scan for "thick" pic/name/bio, "thin" is a "unfollow" signal as default;
                          4-@nick           5-followsyou                +---+  look at follows/followers>5 ratio, last post/reply months or years ago;
                          6-bio personal intro presentation hashtags   /     \ look of the number of posts or replies on their page, is it >100?

       Up/Down:   1-pic presentce/absence, girlpic no/yes; 2-namesurname human like yes/no; 3-bluecheck yes/no; 4-@nick {girly12345,crypto,trading,engagement} bad;
       weight     5-followsyou yes/no; 6-bio missing or bad words - motivational, spammy, political, slogans, tags, politician/name, current/campaign moras.
       Filtering: red flags - no pic, bad name namesurname12345, bad nick girl12345 (except where name and nick match), bad bio missing, bad words "travel love crypto animals
                  countries flags trading politics god christ orphan", acc ratio follows/followers>5; look for collaborating up/down yes/no decide if to Un/follow.

        </li><br>

    <li>
       Prominent accounts of interest add to Lists (independent of following/follow status). Be generous add to >1 list. Create new lists and split existing lists at will.
       Lists: Bio-logy, CEEu-Central Eastern Europe, Chem-istry, Comp-uting, Cul-ture, Data, Econ-omy, Edu-cation, Fin-ance, Hist-ory, HPD-en, Int-elligence, Law, MKD-onia,
       ML-Machine Learning, Phi-losophy, Pol-itics, QT-Quant Trading, Sci-ence, Tech-nology, Urb-anism, Med-ia, NIL (sink list).
       Assign account to list relative to the siginficance meaning of that account to yourself. Don't be objective - be very subjective.
       Depending of how special/general/distinct the list v.s. other TL feeds, do/don't set at list level "Don't show these posts in For You".
       Use "Not interested in this post" and "Show fewer posts from XXX" in the "For you" TL to shape the "For you" TL X provides.
    </li><br>

    <li>
       Assign accounts that are prolific but boring, silly, propagandists, low SNR, low quality, crazies etc that X algo pushes into sink (/dev/null like) list NIL.
       Then tick "Do not show these posts in For You" for that list in the individual list settings.
    </li><br>

    <li>
       If something is worth forwarding, then follow the account. If after a time turns out no synergy - simply unfollow. Give people chance, find out.
       New follow account - try add to a list. Look their bio, keywords matching a list - e.g. Tech-nology, Phi-losophy - honour & add to that list.
       Unfollowing. Favour doers, avoid acc known for being known, non-human, #SLOGAN-s, nick123, marketeers, crypto, girlface, neuro, flags, bolded.
       Take a look at acc photo-name-nick-bio, ask yourself: do I recognize, can I recall of anything about this acc? If NO => then Unfollow.
       If you recognize the acc profile, then: do I recall their posts, will I want to read again tomorrow? If NO => then Unfollow.
       Don't spend time checkng list membership - just Unfollow. Accounts that follow your lists - also follow them, look for synergy.
       Scan the Follows list, keep Follows&le;Followers, both &lt;4K accounts, ~4K is about max that's sane & can be manually maintained.
    </li><br>

    <li>
    Your own posts. Use delete more than you are using now.<br>
    Reread after posting, maybe again latter if there is further interaction. Doesn't read as good now as it did then? Delete now. Reduce further detracting from the global SNR.<br>
    Like your post on posting - reasons:
        <ol type="a">
            <li>To remind yourself that you should really like what you post, never be ashamed of it. If you can't bring yourself to click Like - delete the post.</li>
            <li>Keeps you honest and on your toes not sloppy. Don't be lazy - make that extra effort, spend 30 sec more, google that link or that claim you are making, avoid obvious lazy errors that decrease the general SNR of the convo. Don't hide behind irony, allusions and other plausible-deniability cowardness. (jesters at Kingg's court, unfortunates in a totalitarian regime - they need those tools; but not you; you suffer no ill consequences, while being given a megaphone to the world)</li>
            <li>Reddit and Hacker News automatically credit one uptick to a post to start with, just for posting. Even if a post turns rubbish:
                for the chance taken & effort put in writing something, in prefrence to not writing/keeping quiet - a small reward is deserved.</li>
            <li>Symbolic poetic gives it small good luck push, as if a departing boat, a reminder - once posted, posts start a life of their own.</li>
            <li>So they show in the Liked tab, in context with all the other things read at the time and assumed liked and making an impression enough to post.</li>
        </ol>
    ChatGPT massage and make more readable longer posts. Try indicate to a knowing user that ChatGPT was used without being explicit:
    <ol type="i">
        <li>Use <b>**bold**</b> and <i>*italic*</i> formatting as is ChatGPT default, both for that but also b/c longer posts will warant some markup.</li>
        <li>Don't explicitly disclaim - not only would the space used be inellegant, but may give credence to the "naturalistic" falacy.<br>
           (e.g. we don't ack the keyboard/computer used to type it either)</li>
    </ol>
    </li><br>

    <li>
        Mutuals - accounts where we mutually follow each other. Unfollow mutual iif to significant extent, one of, or both (a)+(b) below, happen:
        <ol type="a">
        <li>No interaction, no synergy. They don't like or reply to your posts, or your replies to their posts, never repost anything you post.</li>
        <li>Suspected Gell-Mann amnesia: stuff you know for sure, you see them post untrue/silly takes. Assume similarly clueless abt stuff you don't know.</li>
        </ol>
       That opens a slot - that would've been taken by their posts - for the Algofeed to put some other post, also from a mutual account, in that slot.
       Don't spam, don't bother people indifferent to you. Maybe they have muted you. Maybe X for does not show your posts to them b/c there's no mutual interests' match.
       Noone's at fault - tried, didn't pan out. Chances are low to start with, it's to be expected, this will be the norm not the exception.
       The aim is bi-directional interaction of high SNR b/c that's *multiplicative*: 100 good connections outweight 1000 poor connections.
    </li><br>

    <li>
       Accounts that blocked you - block back too no exceptions. The tit-for-tat is paradoxicaly way for better cooperation.
       Otherwise prefer (a) NIL sink list shunting; or (b) temporary turn off reposts or mute accounts X is too keen on. But periodically do scan list and unmute.
    </li><br>

    <li>
       Increase the chance of interaction. Keep active - post, quote, reply, repost, like. Heed X "Who to follow" - follow accounts, unfollow if no traction.
       Add interesting posts on Highlights. Periodically scan, find topical or interesting post, repost if still relevance not expired with the time passing.
       There are 8e9 humans, 1e8 on X. Chance to match interests 1:1 is low 1e-16. Keep looking for high SNR interactions. Keep trying to improve the 1% hit rate.
       X/Twitter user moderation is manual, there are no automated tools => seems the physical limit is about 4K acc: 4K follows, 4K followers.
    </li>
    </ol>

        <p>
        X algofeed is moderated every second of the time. Stats as follows. You follow 5000 accounts. Each one writes 1 post a day = 5000 posts a day. You login to X, X algofeed
        serves 50 posts on one screen full. Check X 10 times per day = 500 posts X will show you daily. That is 500 out of possible 5000 to be shown, and 4500 to not be shown.
        X must decide which 500, out of 5000 possible, to show you. Any one post has probability 0.1 to be shown. You will see 1 post from 1 account once in 10 days.
        X algo is non-random, tilts towards factors like accounts interaction, engagemnt via {Like,Forward,Quote,Reply} of posts, bio check. Prob decayed by time with half-life. Link(s) in post penalize post ranking.

        XPro tweetdeck (TLDR: for every list in Lists, add Deck==list; add Deck==list-of-Lists; add Deck==Personal, add Deck==Communities):
        <ol type="i">
            <li>Have List==Deck, add important frequent prominent posters from a List into the Deck.</li>
            <li>Where account belongs to multiple List-s, chose one List only and add it to that one list Deck only.</li>
            <li>Have a separate deck LISTS for all lists, and add all your X Lists in it.</li>
            <li>Have a separate deck for Personal feeds: Search from:ljupc0, @ljupc0 Notifications, Home For you, Home Following, @ljupc0 Grok, Profile My Profile, @ljupc0 My Bookmarks, @ljupc0 Messages, @ljupc0 Explore.</li>
            <li>Have a separate deck for Communities you have joined - add deck Communities and add a selection of joined communities in it.</li>
