        <h1>Knowing - what do I mean when I say I know something</h1>

        <p>Was told "joint probability (density) function between two variables X Y captures all there is ever to be known between them" 25yrs ago (Hola! Miguel! :-)), and it's been a blessing and a curse. Blessing - yeah f_X_Y(x,y) does capture everything. Curse - oft I read sth & think of the author "wish someone told you too".</p>

        <p>TODO TBD</p>
