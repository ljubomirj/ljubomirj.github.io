# Why Write

Q: Why write in public when you can write in private?

A: Yes I have a plain text file \~/logBook for simple note taking. That just works, no fuss.\
I do minimal extra work to have it versioned in \$HOME/.git, and structured in sections FIXME / TODO / DONE / DONTDO.

However. I catch myself bothering people close to me, family and friends, with things I find interesting to talk about and or discuss, that they find less interesting even boring. :-)

So these home pages are written is to take those themes out of my system, while not bothering any of the above mentioned. Only people to read will be online randoms that stumble on this by their own volition - so fine.

Q: Why not use social media, social networks?

A: Yes I do use social networks - most often X [\@ljupc0](https://x.com/ljupc0), sometimes Bsky [\@ljupco.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/ljupco.bsky.social), rarely Mastodon [\@ljupco](https://mstdn.io/@ljupco), and lately I even typed couple of \"Old Man Shouts at the Sky\" rants on Substack [\@ljubomirjosifovski](https://substack.com/@ljubomirjosifovski/posts) to get them out of my system.

There is tons of interesting stuff there, mostly on X due to its user size and \"the Iron Law of public N\^2 square\". I post there, but it seems mostly replies and comments to what other post. Rarely I have something super interesting and urgent that I want to communicate to the world by having the algofeed stuff it into people\'s timelines.

Then while doom scrolling I stumbled upon -

` `[`https://x.com/CJHandmer/status/1839816029473779775`](https://x.com/CJHandmer/status/1839816029473779775)` `[`Casey Handmer`](https://www.caseyhandmer.com/)`, PhD `[`@CJHandmer`](https://x.com/CJHandmer/)` This is your periodic reminder that you should write a blog. It doesn't have to be fancy, it doesn't have to be well-edited. It just has to be something you can cumulatively add to over time. It's easiest to write about stuff you like, and ignore your non-existent audience. 12:54 AM · Sep 28, 2024 `

My initial thoughts were [sceptical still](#){onclick="toggleShowImage('even-so-ees')"} - why do it, when there are

![](even-so-ees.jpeg){#even-so-ees style="display: none; width: 100%; height: auto;" onclick="zoomImage(this)"}

a.  logBook for things private;
b.  X/Bsky/\... for things public; and even
c.  ChatGPT when audience of \>1 is needed, while not exactly needing to broadcast to the whole wide world.

But then I\'ve come around! I\'ve learned to like ethese pages, my online \$HOME in the cyberspace. :-) In addition to them being useful in laying ideas to rest, and moving on. Being bothered for a period of time by the same ideas makes for a boring living. Writing it down here in multiple versions and longer form that can be come back to, add to, revisit old - I like that. It\'s not one-off, fire-and-forget of online quick paced quanta of ideas. I can only ever hold limited number of ideas in my head at the same time, and not juggle them for long before they crash and are forgotten. This goes towards ensuring 1) they are not lost, \"like tears in the the rain\"; and 2) can be turned over faster, juggle different balls up there. :-)

Further - it\'s not only \"unload to writing so my head can fill up again\". The act of formulating ones maybe vague thoughts and ideas, contributes to their formation. It\'s not like that what I say, exists inside me fully formed prior. And now I just broadcast it to the world. No - until we communicate out clearly, ideas we communicate are not fully formed. The process of communication contributes meaningfully to the process of creation, is part of it.

Further, with making them public, there will be other people around, that may read, and come back to push back and even judge me! So there is an aspect of Bet-On-It, take some risk, (even if a tiny risk), or being criticised, or even ridiculed. Concentrates the mind. Motivates the self to some self-discipline. A bit of QC - Quality Control not the worst thing to expose oneself willingly. Most thoughts I have, as with most of us humans - are ofc rubbish, better forgotten.

Since starting this, I came across [Simon Willison's blog](https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/) -\
\
*\"You should start a blog. Having your own little corner of the internet is good for the soul!\"*\
\
\...and now I think there is truth in that.

Another \"please do write - it\'s worth it to you and us too\" [Why write a blog at all?](https://substack.com/inbox/post/145980491) by [Adam Singer](https://x.com/AdamSinger) since articulates it better than I ever could myself.

# My computer \$HOME

I spend most of my time typing into a computer, reading on the computer screen, watching videos or listening to audio playing on a computer, talking and seeing other people through a computer screen. I mostly live in the text world of a terminal [emulator](https://gnome-terminator.org/), [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) command line and the [vim editor](https://www.vim.org/), with [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/) and [Chrome](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/) windows into the world.

Nowadays I use [Xubuntu](https://xubuntu.org) [LTS](https://ubuntu.com/about/release-cycle), on the desktop and on my laptops. I update every 3-4 years to the new version, but other than that - it\'s completely uneventful. The [Xfce](https://www.xfce.org) GUI changes only slowly if ever - and that\'s how I like it.

On the computers used by rest of the family I put Ubuntu as it\'s better looking. They also use Windows desktops and Macbooks for laptops. The Macbooks with the M1-M4 ARM CPU-s have spectacular battery life in addition to great screens. I am looking forward to the day when I add an [ARM Thinkpad](https://www.perplexity.ai/search/arm-thinkpads-wtf0g0o0REahidqJVzJs5w#0) to my daily use. Have couple of [Thinkpads](https://www.reddit.com/r/thinkpad) for the RAM I need. Initially I had 32GB, but now that has grown to 64GB. Can\'t imagine to have less and would like to move to 128GB on the laptop. Have had that much on the desktop for 10 years now. That\'s my first need: get as much RAM as I can. And the 2nd - get as fast an SSD and better NVME as I can. My daily job involves lots of data, and keeping all data needed in memory is the best UI for me. And when not in memory - then on ssd drives and preferably nvme ones.

With the advent of local LLM-s caught the bug with [LocalLLama](https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/)-s. So I finally got myself a 2nd hand (thaks [Hoxton Macs](https://www.hoxtonmacs.co.uk)!) M2 mbp wth 96gb (V)RAM. And it\'s glorious! :-) Love it - the battery life, the screen, but most of all - running local models has been a blast. With [brew](https://brew.sh/) - everything on the command line \"just works\". I get to run tons of local models, mostly [GGUF](https://huggingface.co/docs/hub/en/gguf)-s off [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/models), used with [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggml-org/llama.cpp) and [LMStuidio](https://lmstudio.ai/). In addition, have been gorging on [arxiv](https://arxiv.org) [ML/AI](https://arxiv.org/list/stat.ML/recent) papers and [github](https://github.com) [code](https://github.com/ljubomirj) for a year now - and I\'m still smiling. 😊 This is the best of computers and computing! 🥰

Daily I live in bash and vim mostly inside screen (the multiplexer) inside terminator (the terminal emulator). I use the shell tools, incl awk (that I like) and the rest of the gnu shell tools (grep, sed), git, gcc and g++, make, ssh, rsync, rcopy, Spyder, python, [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com) with [Cline](https://cline.bot) and [Roo](https://github.com/RooCodeInc/Roo-Code) AI-s, Firefox, Thunderbird, Chrome, Edge, Double commander, Evince, VLC player. I like them all - my life would be worse if these free software tools didn\'t exist. Thank you [GNU](https://www.gnu.org) [software](https://www.gnu.org/software/software.en.html), thank you [Linux](https://www.linuxfoundation.org), thank you [FSF](https://www.fsf.org).

Lately I\'ve been having [codex](https://github.com/openai/codex) and [gemini](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli) CLI-s to write lots of code for me, mostly my python, javascript and style-sheets html. They are very good at it! In fact *\$ codex -m gpt-5 -c model_reasoning_effort=\"high\"* is excellent in achieving anything complicated involving the command line: I command codex-gpt-5-high, and it commands the shell. As far as l\'m concerned - my AGI has arrived. 🤯 This is the ghost in the machine - manifest!

In my daily job I used to write quant trading systems and frameworks. But nowadays I\'m all-in back to ML/AI, catching up with everything going on. I use a mix of C/C++, Matlab in the past now octave and python with numpy (and pandas), scripting in bash, awk, plotting in gnuplot, data fetching in sql, kdb.

Everything that I do more then few times on the command line, I \"can\" it into a bash alias or function, and put in my .bashrc. In part to document and not forget. I love that command search works, I can type \$ xyz then press (TAB) and bash will seek to complete for commands starting with xyz. And bash will keep cycling through the completions for as long as I keep pressing the (TAB) key.

I keep my dot rc files under git and that\'s worked without fuss. Looks like this:

    # Keep dot files and other config in git (https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11070797).
    # Step 1: $ git init --bare $HOME/.githome.
    # Step 2: make function (rather than alias to allow for composition like $ GIT=githome gilg; change dir so paths work independent of the current dir):
    githome() { (cd "$HOME" && git --git-dir="$HOME"/.githome/ --work-tree="$HOME" "$@";) }
    # Step 3: disregard files by default, only track explicitly added files: $ githome config status.showUntrackedFiles no.
    # Now use the usual git commands prefixed by githome: $ githome status; githome add .vimrc; githome commit -m "Add vimrc".
    # Issue 1: Can not commit links. For host specific dirs, woraround: 1) move dir to dir-host; 2) link dir to dir-host; 3) add dir-host to git. Example with ~/.config dir:
    #   ljubomir@hostA:~$ l -d .config*
    #   lrwxrwxrwx  1 ljubomir ljubomir   14 Mar 24 14:26 .config -> .config-hostA/
    #   drwx------ 34 ljubomir ljubomir 4.0K Mar 29 12:24 .config-hostA/
    #   drwx------  3 ljubomir ljubomir 4.0K Mar 24 14:52 .config-hostB/
    # Issue 2: To pull from host with temporary IP edit $ vi .githome/config, change the IP below:
    #   [remote "hostC"]
    #   url = ljubomir@192.168.1.117:.githome
    #   fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/hostC/*

    # List all files under management and pretty print if run without args, githome otherwise. (https://mitxela.com/projects/dotfiles_management)
    giho-ls() {
      (cd /
      githome ls-files | while read i; do
        echo -n "$(githome -c color.status=always status "$i" -s | sed "s#$i##")"
        echo -e "¬/$i¬\e[0;33m$(githome -c color.ui=always log -1 --format="%s" -- "$i")\e[0m"
      done
      ) | column -t -s¬
    }
    # Have "local -" to make option "set -x" local to the function only
    giho()                  { local -; set -x; githome "$@"; }
    giho-fetch-hostA()      { local -; set -x; githome fetch "$@" hostA master:hostA; }
    giho-merge-hostA()      { local -; set -x; githome merge "$@" hostA; }
    giho-push-hostA()       { local -; set -x; githome push --follow-tags "$@" hostA master:$(hostname -s); }

Other canned common git commands look like:

    # Git shortcuts. Take the "git" command from the environment via GIT var to allow for goodies:
    #   - use with githome: $ GIT=githome gist
    #   - color terminal (off by default): $ GIT="git -c color.status=always" gist |m
    gi() { ${GIT:-git} "$@"; }
    gist() { ${GIT:-git} status "$@"; }
    gidf() { ${GIT:-git} diff "$@"; }
    gilg() { ${GIT:-git} log -C --name-status --pretty="%h %ae %ai : %s" "$@"; }
    gilgt() { ${GIT:-git} log -C --oneline --stat --decorate "$@"; }
    gi-fetch-hostA() { local GIM=${GIM:-master}; local -; set -x; ${GIT:-git} fetch "$@" hostA ${GIM}:hostA/${GIM}; }
    gi-merge-hostA() { local GIM=${GIM:-master}; local -; set -x; ${GIT:-git} merge "$@" refs/heads/hostA/${GIM}; }
    gi-push-hostA() { local GIM=${GIM:-master}; local -; set -x; ${GIT:-git} push --follow-tags "$@" hostA ${GIM}:"$(hostname -s)"/${GIM}; }

I like and use .bashrc search-previous-command all the time via .inputrc:

    $if Bash
      # Filename completion/expansion
      set completion-ignore-case on
      set show-all-if-ambiguous on
      # Append "/" to all dirnames
      set mark-directories on
      set mark-symlinked-directories on
      # Match all files
      set match-hidden-files on
    $endif

    # Ctrl-Left
    "\e[1;5D": backward-word
    # Ctrl-Right
    "\e[1;5C": forward-word
    # Up
    "\e[A": history-search-backward
    # Down
    "\e[B": history-search-forward

Usually I don\'t customize anything much. I spend most of the time on the command line or in vim anyways, the GUI is mostly vanilla whatever Xfce decides. I notice now my PS1 etc have grown over time:

    PS1='${debian_chroot:+($debian_chroot)}\[\033[01;34m\]\u@\h\[\033[00m\](${STY}:${WINDOW}):\[\033[01;34m\]\w\[\033[00m\]\$ '
    PROMPT_COMMAND='echo -ne "\033]0;${XUSER} (${STY:-$$}) ${VIRTUAL_ENV_PROMPT} ${USER}@${HOSTNAME}:${PWD}\007"'

A researcher, an explorer - usually they need a log book. At work as a researcher I always kept a log book, usually using 2 facing pages per 1 week.

At \$HOME have settled for a \~/logBook that\'s plain ASCII text file under git. Love git for versioning so I don\'t worry that I will delete destroy something by mistake. Also great for synchronisation and replication to various boxes - done with \$ git fetch/merge/push. I have FIXME TODO DONE DONTDO sections. They are \^searchable in vim, e.g. /\^TODO(enter). The entries are short-ish, sentence or 2 or 5, separated by empty line. I start entries with \"- \" so to search easily with /\^-(space)(enter) in vim. Entries move wholesale between sections, the idea is to move them around without further editing. Entry that spends enough time in TODO without moving to DONE is moved to DONTDO after some time. No new entry is added to TODO while the FIXME section is non-empty. If need to, move the blocker from FIXME into TODO. These are housekeeping rules rules of thumb---can be broken with a reason, try not break them without a reason.

I have spent most of my adult life with and around computers. The 1st home computer I saw was ZX-Spectrum 16K that my school [friend](https://www.youtube.com/@AlojzRop) got before me in the last year in elementary school probably 1982-83. Remember the prices still: ZX-Spectrum 16K was £100, 48K model was £130. Commodore C64 was £200. Latter I managed to persuade my parents to buy me a C64 probably around 1985. I learned Basic and 6502 assembler on it, mostly from the [Racunari u vasoj kuci](https://www.racunari.com) (Computers in Your Home) magazine ([recent 40 years anniversary reprint](#){onclick="toggleShowImage('racunari-at-40yrs')"}; click to zoom; the [sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxlndeU3SVY&list=PLw5gIizo9P7eitGr359_UDToGOCInSaa_&index=1) of the [time](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zmt0TNsciU) - yeah, \"[it\'s more fun to compute](kraftwerk-its_more_fun_to_compute-extended.mp3)\"---it always has been).

![](racunari-at-40yrs.jpg){#racunari-at-40yrs style="display: none; width: 100%; height: auto;" onclick="zoomImage(this)"}

By 1987 I finished High school and enrolled BSc undergraduate [studies](https://life.ieee.org/ieee-president-attends-plaque-unveiling-of-ieee-milestone-in-north-macedonia/) in [Electrical Engineering](https://feit.ukim.edu.mk/en/), that turned into [Computer Science](https://www.finki.ukim.mk/) from year 3 onwards. (all together 4.5yrs+diploma work; [the sounds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lv1OLc-M4D0) of my home [town](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skopje)/[country](https://mk.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9C%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B5%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%98%D0%B0) I grew up in, by the [incomparable VS](https://vlatkostefanovski.com.mk/)) Did 1yr National service in-between High School and University, and there I programmed pocket computers HP-71B, Sharp PC-1500 (with the tiny printer), Apple II clone with a Z80 CP/M board and a hard disk (!! remember that CP/M had partitions, but no directories?). Once back home and at Uni from 1988, I finally got my 1st PC (don\'t recall the year exactly) - AT with Intel 80286 CPU, 1MB RAM, Hercules graphics card, 20MB HDD, that probably run MS-DOS 5 or similar. I squeezed a 2400bps modem in the budget too (without MNP5 error correction or compression). The modem proved an excellent decision as it got me into the online world of BBS (e.g. [Sezam](http://pc.pcpress.rs/tekst.php?id=15834)) and latter Internet. All that financed paid for by my ever kind and generous parents - thank you mum and dad!

Since - I\'ve never been too far from a computer for any significant time. Nowadays it\'s mostly Linux (Xubuntu, CentOS, Ubuntu), for a long time earlier it was MS-DOS/Windows (3.1-95-XP-10, cygwin), various Unix too (Solaris, HP-UX, Ultrix, AIX), as well as VAX VMS. And of course - we all carry a magical shiny slabs in our pockets that are super-computers of the old. Mostly various Android for me, but it\'s looking like I\'ll be switching over to iPhone for the AI NPU (Neural nets Processing Units) hardware.

These days I \'m mostly at my [desk](#){onclick="toggleShowImage('garden-office-desk')"}, in a [garden office](#){onclick="toggleShowImage('garden-office')"} (at [end of the work day](#){onclick="toggleShowImage('garden-office-end-day')"}). Sometimes I get a [visitor](#){onclick="toggleShowImage('garden-office-visitor')"} or [two](#){onclick="toggleShowImage('garden-visitor2')"} or [three](#){onclick="toggleShowImage('garden-visitor3')"}.

# Social Networks

I spend a lot of time reading (and sometimes posting) on various Social Networks. I have been on the Internet from the very start of it existing and being available. Prior to Internet, I used home made Bulletin Board Systems (BBS) and computer networks like DECNET, X.25, BITNET, etc.

### X/Twitter

My understanding of how a social network like X/Twitter works is as follows.

Example. I follow 5000 accounts. Each account writes about 1 post a day = 5000 posts a day. Every time I login to X and check X for new posts, the X algofeed serves me 50 posts on one screenful. I check X 10 times per day, 10 times x 50 posts per a screenful = 500 posts that X will show me daily. That is 500 posts, out of the total of 5000 eligible posts that can be shown. The other 4500 eligible posts will not be shown. X must decide which 500, out of 5000 eligible, to show me. Any one post has probability 0.1 to be shown. I expect to see 1 post from 1 account once in 10 days. X algo is non-random and tilts towards factors like accounts interaction (e.g. bio check), engagement with posts {Like,Forward,Quote,Reply}, time of posting. With the timeliness of all these factors is decayed by some half-life (from the event time to now). I presume the most important meta-data is (a) connection (follow/s/er); and (b) timeliness, time of viewing minus time of posting (that decays quickly).

### Algofeed

The Algofeed has no idea about the meaning (let alone the truthfulness) of any content in the post. So afaik the Algofeed has meta-data only to go on, when deciding which post to push onto millions of user screens. I thought by now with all the LLM-s (and DNN-s before) posts and accounts would have been judged by the content much much more, even if with a single word2vec type vector. And that the Algofeed would take that into account. But I have not seen anything to indicate that there is any content processing.

Algofeed using meta-data mostly strikes me as being \"judged on the color of your skin\" phase of the Social Network-s, and would be good to transition to \"judged on the content of the character\", of each and every one of the posts. (and downstream - users)

There\'s is no censorship involved - I can go to every one of those 4500 accounts home pages, and read every one of those 4500 posts.\
There\'s no moderation - those 4500 posts are perfectly fine.\
They are not even totally suppressed - another user may have his 500 shown posts come from the 4500 not shown to me. (the algofeed will on average prefer some over the others though)\
The algofeed simply has to make a selection, as it\'s not physically possible to fit 5000 posts on my screen. As simple as.

Not having an algofeed is impossible. Not only X but all social media - FB, IG, TikTok, TG, etc. This is how it works. The Algofeed moderates every user experience every second. There is not a moment that we the users don\'t get the algofeed doing something for us. I read people write \"I don\'t want no algorithmic feed. Just give me the posts of users I follow in reverse time order\". Well - you just described a specific algorithmic feed. (aside: I do want that feed too, sometimes. There is no reason why us users can\'t have the choice of 1000s of Feeds. To some extent that happens on Bsky; that is afaics the only remotely plausible X/Twitter competitor atm).

### Publisher 9/10-ths, carrier 1/10-th

I heard this metaphor / abstraction by Yuval Harari recently. The algofeed deciding which 500 posts I see today out of smaller selection of 5000 (out of total of 1B possible per day) is an editor (even if automated), and X is a publisher (even if automated). The users are readers are also writers creating content without commission or pay. I don\'t see how X (and FB, TikTok etc) are not media companies (as opposed to - a point to point carrier of signals). They are even selling and living off adverts! :-) (mostly; X not so much nowadays) This idea is unlikely to be accepted easily. I also like to have the freedom to find all manner of crazy insane untrue stuff online. I defo see though how there is tension between freedom, disagreement, competition and order, working in unison, cooperation. Good [\@harari_yuval](https://x.com/harari_yuval) on [\@seanilling](https://x.com/seanilling)\'s \"The Gray Area \| Yuval Noah Harari on the AI revolution\" <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uhx1sdX2bow> on this.

We have implicit abstraction in our heads that X/Twitter is a kind of public square, with many-to-many N-to-N, ultimately all-to-all communication. It ain\'t so. That N-to-N does not scale to N=100M users, it breaks down after N=10 or so.\
When a user posts something, that post is simply recorded on a computer (disk). Nothing more. Yes - it\'s the user that presses the post button. No - that doesn\'t push the post into millions of timelines. It\'s the algofeed that takes that post, and shoves it into millions of screens.\
I am inclined to agree with Harari on that. Social media are Media, X is a publisher, and their algorithms are their editors. It\'s fair to judge the algofeed should by the same criteria as the editor of any old media. It\'s new kind of media, but it\'s still Media. All elements are here, with small differences in operation or business model, and plenty of automation in top.

### Other, wishlist

Advertising. In non-social one-to-many media the adverts are broadcast to all. So if there is a falsehood or slander in an advert - everyone can see it, then provide feedback and critique. In social media (e.g. FB) one-to-one advertising is completely private. Every one use may be shown a (a) separate and different advert, and (b) completely untruthful, and there will be no way for anyone else to know. The advert is 1:1 between the user and the platform, completely secret. Platforms should be required to provide access to the adverts they serve to a third party. Ideally - adverts should be available for inspection by all users at all times, and in an online archive too with the historic adverts there too.

Community Notes. I got enrolled at some point (not sure why - I vaguely remember X offered, and I agreed) in the Community Notes programme on X. I get to vote on Community Notes others have written. And also to add notes for others to vote on - but have not done that yet.\
Someone explained that the logic/istics behind is: find sufficient group of people that disagree on other issues, but agree on the note, for the note to be published. That strikes me as valuable insight. I\'m surprised how well it works. Have to look up again the maths, the linear algebra of it - there was some SVD involved.\
It\'s good, but it\'s wholly insufficient for a network flooded with falsehoods on an industrial scale. While the notes are being submitted and voted on, the Algofeed pushes the Post onto millions of screens. Then after a week, a Note is ready and published. From now on, it will be shown together with the original post - good. If I clicked Like or Repost, I will get a Notification that a Note appeared - good. However - millions of people that merely viewed the original post when the algofeed pushed it onto their screen - they will never see the Note.\
It\'s the Social Network equivalent to an old style Newspaper correction. A false story is splashed on the front page for millions to read. Then a week latter, Correction appears deep on page 23, that few read. Good that it happens - but insufficient.

As with other things, in social networks too: incentives -\> results. Engagement is maximized when 1/2 of users are at the throats of the other 1/2, and that\'s exactly the result we got. Took time but we are reaching that destination.\
I want to get 1000 Feeds on X, incl some user defined, instead of the medieval choice of 2 - \"For you\" and \"Following\". X went wide did Communities, some way towards conference style (current leader in that is Reddit), instead of deep improving the quality of their core product.\
Another thing I want to see is RealHuman flag, and I\'d pay small one off fee for that. And then to be able to filter on that flag (or not). That\'s unlikely to happen too it seems.\

### Replicate your social graph Follows-Followers

Starting a new platform is so hard as to be impossible, because it\'s a collective action problem \*and\* needs to happen at the same time in a short time window. Only external event can force that, c.f. Brazil ban.\
Best one can do in the mean time is replicate their Social Graph, find their Follows and Followers, on alternative platforms. There will be insufficient traffic there. The \"public Square N\^2 iron law of network value\" ensures the biggest network wins every time. NB the posts have rarely have permanent relevance. They are more like flowing water, are quickly re-created. Most are time-events-sensitive anyway, the content is non transplantable in time. It\'s not the posts that keep users locked in the social network.

The \"social graph\" that is Followers-Follows is what keeps users locked in a social network. I saw the \"portable social graph\" 1st on [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social). So having your Social Graph at the ready on an alternative place is half the job done. It\'s also prudent - anything may happen to X/Bsky/FB etc, incl being banned by a misfiring algorithm (there is rarely any human support). Given alternatives are free - I see no reason to not reserve your favourite user nickname on Bsky or Mastodon or similar.

Periodically there is discussion on X/Twitter if users need or want to switch to some other network. I don\'t think people will switch any time soon, unless forced to do. I keep accounts on multiple platforms anyway. Imo the largest single public square N\^2 wins every time - that\'s the iron law of social anything.\
It\'s expected and explained in (computer) networks: the number of connections \~N\^2 grows with the square of the number of nodes \~N. And the value to us, users, lies in the interactions facilitated by those connections. And those connections accrue with the square of the user base. Between a larger (2N) and a smaller (N) public square, the larger one will provide as much value in a \~day as the smaller one in a \~week. Users will switch smaller-\>larger, increasing the difference, in a +ve feedback loop. Until approx only 1 remains standing. Ultimately it\'s a winner takes all.\
Switching to another network is a very specific collective action problem. Social media natural monopoly network effect can only be circumvented by synchronization, moving \*at the same time\* by millions of users. The timeliness makes all the difference - must be all at the same time. So Brazil user base may switch b/c the ban forces them to move at the same time. UK user base is unlikely to switch as there is no ban.

### TINA, but use tools available too

There are no reason to not create a Bsky account. It\'s easy and free. Comparing X:Bsky=100:10 millions of real users (assuming much bigger X bot ratio), ratio 10, squared makes it 100. Do I see as much interesting stuff on X in 1 day, as I see in Bsky in 3 months? Possibly. For me maybe the ratio of value is lower, but \~2 months seems plausible to me.

Personally, I find my Twitter experience positive overall. I read about negative encounters, but I rarely see ugliness on my TL. I believe it the 1st time when people show me who/what they are or stand for: I am quick to block and mute, not into giving 2nd chances (online; IRL I\'m not like that). There are another 8 Billion people that we can interact with online! No need to easily avoidable aggravation. I rely on Lists - Sci-ence, Tech-nology, Comp-uting, Bio-logy, Che-mistry\... - to curate my feeds beyond just \"For You\" and \"Followers\". Lists help shape the timeline, maintain focus and have ok SNR. Additionally, I tie individual Lists to separate Decks on XPro, effectively creating personalized thematic websites. [XPro decks setup for X Lists](#){onclick="toggleShowImage('Xpro-decks')"}. (click to zoom)

![](Xpro-decks.png){#Xpro-decks style="display: none; width: 100%; height: auto;" onclick="zoomImage(this)"}

I find [Bsky](https://bsky.app) ok, just fine. The [Feeds](https://bsky.app/feeds) feature is much better than on X! Users are not constrained to the 2 feeds (\"For You\" and \"Followers\") that X deigned to supply. I count Mutuals, FollowersLike, OnlyPosts, Folowing, LatestFromFollows, BestOfFollows, Discover, PopularWithFriends, QuietPosters, WhatsHotClassic, CatchUp, TheGram\... And there many more to choose from. Seems both users and developers can create both simpler and more complex feeds, with dozen baselines provided by Bsky. Pleasantly surprised to find [deck.blue](https://deck.blue/) [bsky decks](https://bsky.app/profile/deck.blue) too. Transferring user lists is a chore though, finding the same people is hard. \"Sky Follower Bridge\" works well as described in [https://www.wikihow.com/Import-Twitter-to-Bluesky]{href\"https:="" www.wikihow.com="" import-twitter-to-bluesky\"=""}, but it\'s still weekends of manual work. Ofc, even if you find the same people, most post on X much more than on Bsky. Going back to short/original length posts and having to chain long post as 1/ 2/ 3/ etc parts is annoying tbh.\

![](deck-blue.png){#deck-blue style="display: none; width: 100%; height: auto;" onclick="zoomImage(this)"}

### Algofeed and S230?

Doubt that anyone is coming after the Algofeed - but maybe someone should. S230 I am happy to (effectively) protect me, and other humans, and also X from me. However, S230 should not protect the X Algofeed, as it\'s not a human, from shoving insane dross onto 100M screens daily. Engagement is maximized when 1/2 is at the throats of the other 1/2, and that\'s exactly the result we got. Years passed, yet there\'s been minimal improvement in my Algofeed experience. Only change I remember was \"For you\" and \"Following\" separation as top-line option (it used to be in Settings or some such half-hidden place before Musk). I hate it that things stagnate, nothing changes for ages, hundreds of suggestions posted on \"X bugs & features\" Community are ignored. I guess this is what Social Network monopoly looks? No idea how to incentivise X to give me better choice there - I want a choice of 1000s of Feeds. X are asleep at the wheel. Maybe a kick in the backside, some stick is needed to shake things a bit in that space?

I read an explainer on the state of the play, the history, the dilemmas, the legal issues, and including the most recent US court rulings that maybe relevant (or not) for the future by [\@matthewstoller](https://x.com/matthewstoller) at <https://thebignewsletter.com/p/judges-rule-big-techs-free-ride-on>.

Thinking back at the time in the 90s the context in which S230 arose. This was time of ISPs like Prodigy, AOL, Compuserve, some of which were standalone non-Internet connected platforms to start with (and connecting to the free Internet afterwards, some trying and failing in creating own private walled gardens). As Internet as is now didn\'t exist! So they were kind of similar to a telephone company in that we used a telephone to access them. Like an add-on service to my phone service. Then with Internet ISP-s started adding services - connectivity to it, Internet email, maybe small personal web pages space, etc. In that context ISP-s got protection from liability arising from carrying user-generated content, in e.g. email lists, personal web pages and similar.

It strikes me that modern Social networks now are nothing like that. Now it\'s an entirely different world, completely unrecognizable to how things were in 1990-s when these laws were put in place. My ISP that is broadband provider has no relation to X. Not sure what\'s to be done. This is US and Law - two areas I\'m no expert in.

### Medium, message

The medium shapes the message applied to current social media - examples.

a.  Reddit. Thematic conferences where a new message is longer post on some topic in that conference. Replies discuss that topic in great detail. Audience: like minded randoms around the globe that will not be met IRL, interested in the same topics. By the tail end can be extreme niche subjects.
b.  Facebook. Personal stuff, short messages and photos, documenting IRL what\'s happening to me in my life, along the times axis. Audience: close family, close friends.
c.  Instagram. Pictures and videos for looks, feelings. The most superficial or aspirational version of myself. Pure form, no function. Audience: everyone that would envy me, friends, distant relatives.
d.  Twitter. Text mainly, short text messages. Text - content is the king not the presentation. Short - quantas of ideas, no place for long or subtle discussion. Shit posting and meming, esp on X. Audience: random unknown strangers, some under IRL names but lots of anon- and pseudo-anons, and bots.
e.  Substack. Text mainly, personal web sites for writers. Longer text form, but also nice pictures and designs. Real people, and almost all under their real life names too. Highest SNR but takes effort. Audience: public intellectuals.

\"The medium is the message\" is a catchy way to say the medium that carries the message affects the message itself, its content. The medium makes some kinds of messages easy to transmit (so they spread more), and other kinds of messages hard to transmit (so they don\'t spread). Given that messaging in turn in/forms our ideas, and ideas in/form our stories, and we humans are influenced greatly by the stories in our heads, and then we influence and change the real world around us, it follows: the change of medium of communication is going to change our lives our behaviours. The Gutenberg press did that and there was huge change, then with the radio and latter TV too, and now in our lifetimes initially the Internet and latest social media are doing it too.

# Twitter surviving - personal considerations, tips, practices

This is a write down of how I (think I) use X (formerly Twitter). This is not - how to be popular, or how to be an influencer, or how to get a flock of followers. Even to the contrary - these are probably anti-patterns if your are aiming for fame & fortune.

These are written down what I think are my personal tips, previously unwritten guidelines, my own practices, of how I use X. I have gotten a lot out of X! There are many people that complain about all manner of things - but many many more that don\'t. The number of interesting things, links, discussions out there - is mind boggling. By SNR - it\'s way way better than the forums of old. I think - I put a only a little more effort than the minimal (about zero), to gain a whole lot more out of X. Same goes for Bsky. By default - both are pretty bland. But - put some effort in aggressively shaping your Follows-Followers, blocking and muting the worst offenders accounts (to whatever your taste is), muting words (esp related to some event - politics elections, football tournaments, etc), adding accounts to thematic personal List-s, and you may see disproportionate returns. There are interesting things out there - but they are like small fish in a humongous ocean. A very low probability finds. So like a gambler tilting the odds of fortuna ever so slightly to his advantage at every opportunity - do try to shift the otherwise unfavourable odds, make them be little less so.

Lately I notice similar usage patterns developing in my Bsky usage. Given there is only X and Bsky, and what was Twitter is now X, I will use the term the \"Twitter\" as a generic term to refer to both of them. Think possibly Mastodon is similar enough that it can be encompassed too. In the future - hopefully other networks too. The format seems general enough to be own genre. A social media network, primary text-based read/write, with short public posts as default, where posts can be considered minimal units of messaging, \"quantas of ideas\".

X - tips, guidelines, my practices.

a.  On mobile use browser <https://x.com/home> or X app, <https://bsky.app/> or Bsky app. A browser tab is better than an App insofar one can open many tabs, with many views, while the App is only ever a single view. Further, better to use open web standards, and avoid using closed walled garden App-s where possible. What\'s used lives and develops, what\'s not used dies off.
b.  On desktop use XPro <https://pro.x.com> [Tweetdeck](#){onclick="toggleShowImage('xpro-decks-lists-comms-1234')"} and deck.blue <https://deck.blue/> [decks](#){onclick="toggleShowImage('deck-blue-2')"}. Default to LISTS deck, check Personal, and only dive into individual lists when time to spare.
    ![](xpro-decks-lists-comms-1234.png){#xpro-decks-lists-comms-1234 style="display: none; width: 100%; height: auto;" onclick="zoomImage(this)"} ![](deck-blue-2.png){#deck-blue-2 style="display: none; width: 100%; height: auto;" onclick="zoomImage(this)"}
c.  Search own history - on X <https://x.com/search?q=(from%3Aljupc0)&src=typed_query>, on Bsky <https://bsky.app/search?q=from%3Aljupco.bsky.social> (click on Latest).
d.  Search own history in date range \[2024-03-03,2024-05-13\] on X <https://x.com/search?q=(from%3Aljupc0)%20until%3A2024-05-13%20since%3A2024-03-03&src=typed_query&f=live> then click on Latest to reverse sort by time.
e.  More X search tips at <https://help.x.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-advanced-search>.
f.  Filter own X TL feed with \"filter:follows -filter:replies include:nativeretweets\" so <https://x.com/search?q=filter%3Afollows%20-filter%3Areplies%20include%3Anativeretweets&src=typed_query&f=live> or shorter <https://x.com/search?q=(from%3Aljupc0)&src=typed_query&f=live>.

TL curating, dual aim: maximize SNR, maximize interaction. Assume value comes from connections between nodes.

Expected hit rate \~1% for minimal interaction (Like) that carries zero risk cost to the reader when reading a post user wrote.

Rules of thumb - break them with a reason, but not without any.

1.  Accounts to follow: any that seem interesting, notable, authors of books, videos, blog posts, podcasts etc you have already read, heard, watched. If recognize the name or the face =\> follow. Those that are mutuals - select +Notify on them to be reminded of their existing. X-algo mostly cares about \'Follow\'-ing, but not about \'Mutual\'-s where we both follow each other. Notifications were broken for most of X existing, but work lately. So use them for Mutuals. Mutual is a much stonger signal, N\^2 instead of mere N. X is stupid/malevolent here - so use Notifications as a reminder for (Mutual,Now) post. Notifications should only be shown for Mutual-s. Where they are not a Mutual - turn off the Notification check mark.
    \

2.  Follow back everyone that follows you as a default to start with. Take a chance on the possibility of interaction. (even if it\'s a small one.) Exceptions obvious spam accounts: elonmuskXXX, phishingXXX, celebrityXXX, influencerXXX, cryptoXXX, tradeXXX, casinoXXX, girlXXX, motivationalXXX. Don\'t follow obvious trolls, fakes, pseudoanons that are high volume general posters unless thematic (technology, science) that is of personal interest.
    \

3.  When deciding should I follow or not, the question asked is: will I like to see this user posts in the future? Have your best guess - yes or no? Look holistically at the combined total of info available, forecast a) is the user a real human? b) will I want to read posts from them?

                Info:      1-pic   2-namesurname     3-bluecheck                \     / Scan for "thick" pic/name/bio, "thin" is a "unfollow" signal as default;
                                   4-@nick           5-followsyou                +---+  look at follows/followers>5 ratio, last post/reply months or years ago;
                                   6-bio personal intro presentation hashtags   /     \ look of the number of posts or replies on their page, is it >100?

                Up/Down:   1-pic presence/absence, girlpic no/yes; 2-namesurname human like yes/no; 3-bluecheck yes/no; 4-@nick {girly12345,crypto,trading,engagement} bad;
                weight     5-followsyou yes/no; 6-bio missing or bad words - motivational, spammy, political, slogans, tags, politician/name, current/campaign morass.
                Filtering: red flags - no pic, bad name namesurname12345, bad nick girl12345 (except where name and nick match), bad bio missing;
                           bad words - "travel love crypto animals countries flags trading politics god christ orphan", acc ratio follows/followers>5;
                           net evidence good/bad flags/words - look for collaborating up/down yes/no decide if to Un/follow.

    \
    If spending more time than a split second to decide: Grok \"Summarise Profile\", check profile Pinned post, 1st page of Posts, Replies, Highlights.

    \

4.  Prominent accounts of interest add to Lists. (independent of following/follow status.) Doesn\'t have to be 1 single list, but don\'t overdo it: don\'t want too many lists to look same like the personal \@acc. Create new lists, split existing lists at will. Lists: Tech-nology, ML-Machine Learning, QT-Quant Trading, Comp-uting, Data, Sci-ence, Chem-istry, Bio-logy, Phi-losophy, Edu-cation, Fin-ance, Econ-omy, Hist-ory, Cul-ture, Med-ia, Law, Pol-itics, Urb-anism, HPD-Harpenden, MKD-Macedonia, CEEu-Central Eastern Europe, Int-elligence. Assign account to list relative to the significance/meaning of that account to yourself - be very subjective. Depending of how special/general/distinct v.s. other feeds, do/don\'t set at list level \"Don\'t show these posts in For You\". Accounts followed that are high volume so there is 0 interaction - use Lists, add to list then Unfollow. Use \"Not interested in this post\" and \"Show fewer posts from\" in the \"For you\" to shape the feed.
    \

5.  Accounts prolific posters, but boring, silly, propagandists, low SNR, low quality, crazies etc that X algos pushes - add to sink /dev/null list NIL. Then tick \"Do not show these posts in For You\" for that list in the individual list settings. Block is now uni-directional - use it more. Avoid Mute - it\'s another chore list to go through in future un-Mute scans.
    \

6.  If something is worth forwarding, then follow the account. Give it a chance, find out. If after a time turns out no synergy - unfollow latter. Exceptions---big accounts with HUGE following: like mass-media of old 1:N boradcasting, zero interaction---don\'t follow. New follow account---add to a list. Look their bio, keywords matching a list - e.g. Tech-nology, Sci-ence - honour & add to that list.
    \

7.  Unfollowing. Read the \"Following\" feed, find a posts you dislike, check \@acc, if not a mutual - then Unfollow. General rule-favour doers. Don\'t follow acc known for being known, non-human, #SLOGAN-s, nick123, marketeers, crypto, girlface, neuro/disorder, flags, bolded. Take a look at acc photo-name-nick-bio, ask yourself: do I recognize, can I recall of anything about this acc? If NO =\> then Unfollow. If you recognize the acc profile, then: do I recall their posts, will I want to read again tomorrow? If NO =\> then Unfollow. Don\'t be petty. If you like someone\'s posts - keep following. There is still \>0 value in one sided interaction. Don\'t spend time checking list membership, assume already checked and added. Accounts following your lists - follow too, look for synergy.
    \

8.  Manual \"Activity Feed\". When \@acc appers in Notifications, use the opportunity to check their posts. Go throught the top pages of their Posts, Replies, Highlights. Read posts, like and re-post, reply to any of interest. Keep in mind un/follow decision is a low-regret one. Be proactive, un-follow if Algofeed is too pushy, re-follow to check back after a time. Don\'t bother with numbers, don\'t spend time on QC checking lists, give up on manual curration. Just keep adding users to the lists. When the ratio Follows/Followers is too high, X will not allow you to add to Follow. Then go through the Followers list, just looking at the list Un-follow ones that a) can\'t recall reading from b) don\'t follow you c) lack BT d) lack pic e) lack bio f) lack IRL name.
    \

9.  Your own posts. Like your own posts on posting - or not! Use AI to spruce them up - or not!\
    Reasons for liking your own:
    a.  To remind self that you should really like what you post, to never be ashamed of it. If you don\'t like what you post---how is anyone else to?\
        Keeps you honest on your toes. Don\'t get sloppy. Don\'t hide behind irony, allusions and other plausible-deniability cowardess.
    b.  Reddit and Hacker News automatically credit one uptick to a post to start with, just for posting. Even if a post turns rubbish:\
        for the chance taken & effort put in writing/doing, in preference to not writing/keeping quiet, a small reward is deserved.
    c.  Symbolic poetic gives it small good luck push. As if a departing boat. A reminder---once posted, post starts a life, a journey, of their own.
    d.  So they show in the Liked tab, in context with all the other things read at the time and assumed like for making an impression enough to post.

    Reasons against liking your own:
    e.  It\'s a bit pathetic, looks needy.

    Use ChatGPT to massage and make more palatable longer posts. Try indicate to a knowing user that ChatGPT was used without being explicit:
    g.  Use \*\***bold**\*\* and \**italic*\* formatting as is ChatGPT default, both for that but also b/c longer posts will warant some markup.
    h.  Don\'t explicitly disclaim: wastes space, is inelegant, gives credence to the \"naturalistic\" fallacy. (we don\'t ack keyboard/computer either)

    \

10. Mutuals - accounts where we mutually follow each other. Even if no significant interaction, persist. No interaction is probably to X never putting your posts in the their feed and vice versa. Chances of someone checking anyones personal page is \~0. Only ever unfollow if suspect reading theirs reduce your knowledge. E.g. suspected Gell-Mann Amnesia. Don\'t worry about the numbers, give up on manual curration. The aim is bi-directional interaction of high SNR b/c that\'s \*multiplicative\*: 100 good connections outweigh 1000 poor connections. For that to happen---more likely if mutuals, than not.
    \

11. Accounts that blocked you - block back too no exceptions. While it\'s emotionally satifying (+1) and tit-for-tat is (paradoxically) fine strategy for better coordination (+2), the final decider (+Inf) is: obviously they found the interaction unsatisfactory. So now: don\'t insist, that would be both stupid and semi-violent. Block them so to minimise any temptation for any future interaction that X may tempt you into. There are another 8B humans to potentially interact with. Give people a chance. Otherwise prefer (a) NIL sink list shunting; or (b) temporary turn off reposts X is too keen on. Avoid Mute - keep the Mute list empty, it\'s too much hassle to be maintaining manually both a Mute and a Block list. From time to time semi annually go through the blocked list and unblock every account (ragardless if still blocked). It\'s manual and 50 accounts/pop before getting throttled by X - but still persever and clear the list. Then start a new cycle from ground zero.
    \

12. Increase the chance of interaction. Keep active - post, quote, reply, repost, like. Heed X \"Who to follow\" - follow accounts, unfollow if no traction. Add interesting posts on Highlights.

# Knowing - what do I mean when I say I know something

I was told \"the joint probability density function between two variables \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) captures everything that there is ever to be known about the relation between those \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\)\" 25 years ago (¡Hola! [Miguel](https://faculty.ucmerced.edu/mcarreira-perpinan/) :-)), and it\'s been a blessing and a curse. Blessing - yeah the joint pdf \\( f\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\) really does capture everything. Curse - often I read an article and think of the author \"wish someone told you too\", you poor soul.

So for me knowing something about \\( X \\) means knowing the distribution, the pdf \\( f_X(x) \\). Most of the time our knowledge is more than 1-dimensional, we have at least two qualities that we want to quantify the relationship of. So knowing something about \\( (X,Y) \\) jointly, for me means knowing the joint pdf \\( f\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\).

Knowledge is knowing the joint probability function - either density p.d.f. or cumulative c.d.f. (using p.d.f. mostly to illustrate). Density p.d.f. or cumulative c.d.f. is an implementation detail. Depends on the mechanics of the contraption, can be both in the same device, is up to the implementation.

So knowledge is - joint density, is co-counts, counting number of times things of interest co-occur, happen together. (in the 1st approximation; more accurate would be to say - knowledge is absence of ignorance, and our ignorance is what we measure by the joint density, the co-counts etc; our ignorance is never zero and consquently our knowledge is never complete)

Probability is the measure of the residual uncertainty. Like length measures distance, probability measures uncertainty. Randomness is what gives us probability distributions that are not Dirac impulses, and thus gives us information content to work with.

NB the single letters \\( X \\) and \\( Y \\) are multi-dimensional, \\( N \\)-dimensional and \\( M \\)-dimensional vectors. The domain of the pdf is \\( (N + M + 1) \\)-dimensional in general, with \\( N \\)-input \\( X \\), \\( M \\)-output \\( Y \\), 1-extra dimension where counting or quantity of probability density or mass happens. [+]{.sec-toggle aria-controls="time-detail1" aria-expanded="false"}[[ *(The one extra dimension where counting happens is time. Time is somewhat special TBD will concern with it latter. For now: without time there is no discrete events or observations and no counting either, so no joint density, so no knowledge either. Time is necessary - but not sufficient - condition for us to get to know the world around us.)* ]{style="font-size: 90%;"}]{#time-detail1 hidden=""}

Time in space-time \\( (x,y,z,t) \\) plays the same role as the \\( p \\) axis in a joint probability \\( p=f(x,y) \\): it is the special dimension that lets us count, accumulate, and order events. No time, no counting; no counting, no density. Conversely probabilities are always positive while time only flows forward---both axes are bounded and one-way.

The split \\( (X,Y) \\) is arbitrary as decided by us. Usually - \\( X \\) is what we observe easily but we don\'t care much about, \\( Y \\) is what we don\'t observe directly but care about would like to know which one. So by relating \\( X \\) to \\( Y \\), we want to deduce something about \\( Y \\), while observing \\( X \\).

These things of interest are \"qualities\". Quality is one dimension out of N in an N-dim vector space. Within one \'quality\' that\'s \'what\', we will measure counts those will be \'quantity\' or \'how much\' or \'how many\'. [+]{.sec-toggle aria-controls="time-detail2" aria-expanded="false"}[[ *(TBD consider latter, but: while and to the extent the dimension N can\'t be forecast with 0 error from the other (N-1) dimensions, it exists as a separate dimension. Once it can be forecast with 0 error from the rest - it collapses and stops existing afa we are concerned.)* ]{style="font-size: 90%;"}]{#time-detail2 hidden=""}

Space itself can be phrased this way: what is truly "nearby" has a non-trivial joint distribution \\( p(\\text{here},\\text{nearby}) \\neq p(\\text{here})p(\\text{nearby}) \\). What is far apart factors and therefore forgets about each other. Closeness is simply dependence.

In the simplest case of a single quality, single dimension X in 1D, knowledge of X is the p.d.f. of X \\( f_X(x) \\). Everything that there is to be known about X is described by the re-normalised histogram of X where we count which ones of X, and then how many of which one.

The first non trivial case of knowledge is where we have two qualities, two dimensions X and Y, \\( (X,Y) \\) in 2D, knowledge is the joint p.d.f. of X and Y that is \\( f\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\).

Everything that can be known about the relationship between two qualities X and Y is captured and described about their joint p.d.f. \\( f\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\).

If we know the joint p.d.f. \\( f\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\), we can derive the prior distributions both for X that is \\( f_X(x) \\), and for Y that is \\( f_Y(y) \\), by marginalisation. Marginal p.d.f.s are \\( f_X(x) = \\int_y f\_{X,Y}(x,y) dy \\) and \\( f_Y(y) = \\int_x f\_{X,Y}(x,y) dx \\). Marginalisation is \"adding up\" the probability mass in the dimension(s) we don\'t care about, the one(s) we marginalise out. Marginalisation maybe thought as \"forgetting\" - the detail is lost, but we achieve efficiency (less parameter), and robustness - we are not dependent anymore on the variable that was marginalised out (we are independent of it now - at least in our p.d.f.), [+]{.sec-toggle aria-controls="time-detail3" aria-expanded="false"}[[ *Keeping detail so not cost free, it takes resource implementing it. So if we don\'t need a particular dimension particular quality for whatever our goals are - it\'s better to forget about it.* ]{style="font-size: 90%;"}]{#time-detail3 hidden=""}

Once we observe one of the qualities that are \\( (X,Y) \\), e.g. X, that shrinks the domain from 2D to 1D, and now everything that can be known about Y is described by conditional p.d.f. \\( f\_{Y\|X}(y\|x=a) \\) that is computed by plugging \\( x=a \\) into the joint p.d.f. \\( f\_{X,Y}(x=a,y) \\), then dividing re-normalising that function by the prior p.d.f. of X \\( f_X(x) \\) at \\( x=a \\) giving rise to new conditional p.d.f. \\( f\_{Y\|X}(y) \\) for Y that is defined as \\( f\_{Y\|X}(y) = \\frac{f\_{X,Y}(a,y)}{f_X(a)} \\).

Below I illustrate this point on the example of a joint pdf \\( p = f\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\) that is a mix of two Gaussians in 2D space \\( (x,y) \\). We observe the variable \\( X \\), and that observations is \\( x=1 \\). The question is - what do we now know about the variable \\( Y \\), having observed the variable \\( X \\) (to be \\( x=1 \\)).

The observation \\( x=1 \\) is equivalent to the joint pdf being cut by the plane \\( x=1 \\). The intersection of the joint pdf \\( f\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\) and the plane \\( x=1 \\) is \\( f\_{X,Y}(x=1,y) \\). This curve is the best description of what we now know about the distribution of the unobserved variable \\( Y \\).

The starting model that was \\( f\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\) is affected by the observation \\( x=1 \\). The effect is the intersection \\( f\_{X,Y}(x=1,y) \\), and is outlined below. It is a function of \\( y \\), that is a scaled conditional \\( f_Y(y\|x=1) = \\frac{f\_{X,Y}(x=1,y)}{f_X(x=1)} \\). The conditional pdf is \\( f_Y(y\|x) \\).

The scaler \\( f_X(x=1) \\) is the marginal pdf \\( f_X(x) \\) of \\( X \\) at point \\( x=1 \\). The marginal pdf \\( f_X(x) \\) is computed from the joint pdf \\( f\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\) by marginalization, by integrating out \\( Y \\) as \\( f_X(x) = \\int f\_{X,Y}(x,y)\\,dy \\) and then plugging in \\( x=1 \\).

Everything that can be known about about anything can be construed as a relation between two things. *(at the baseest level - myself and the world, the I and not-I.)* Call them X and Y. So all knowledge about \\( (X,Y) \\) (what X tells us about Y, what Y tells us about X) - is in that X-Y relationship.

Everything that can be known about X-Y relationship is captured and described about their joint p.d.f. \\( p=f\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\) or just \\( p=f(x,y) \\) the density; or c.d.f. \\( p=g\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\) then it\'s just \\( P=g(x,y) \\) the cumulative. And that\'s it. The probability distribution captures all that can ever be known about the \\( (X,Y) \\) relationship.

Once X \\( x=a \\) is observed, then everything that is known about Y is described by the conditional p.d.f. \\( p=f\_{Y\|X}(y\|x=a) \\) or just \\( p=f(y\|x) \\) at \\( x=a \\).

The 3D function \\( p=f(x,y) \\) is cut with a plane \\( x=a \\). The cross section is \\( f(x=a,y) \\). It\'s not a p.d.f. as it does not sum to 1. The area of the cross section \\( \\{f(x,y),x=a\\} \\) that is a scalar is the area under \\( f(x,y) \\) at \\( x=a \\). This is also the value of the marginal p.d.f. \\( f_X(x) = \\int f(x,y) dy \\) at \\( x=a \\), i.e. \\( p=f_X(x=a) \\). To convert \\( f(x=a,y) \\) into conditional p.d.f. \\( f(y\|x=a) \\) we divide joint p.d.f. \\( f(x=a,y) \\) with the scalar (constant) that is marginal p.d.f. \\( f_X(x=a) \\): \\( f(y\|x=a)=f(x=a,y)/f_X(x=a) \\).

Coming back to \"joint pdf captures everything there is in the relationship \\(X,Y\\)\". Putting it in a wider context.

When reading about knowledge, I have come across the following so collected here for future reference.

We can have 2 types of knowledge about the outcome of (repeated) experiment(s):

a.  [We know what will happen and when it will happen in each experiment. This is non-probabilistic, deterministic knowledge. NB it is a special case of [both](#know-pdf) [(b)](#aleo-pdf) cases below with the pdf being a Dirac impulse function.]{#know-dirac}
b.  [We know the possible outcomes, we know how many of each will happen if we do 100 experiments, but for each 1 experiment, we can\'t tell the outcome. This is probabilistic knowledge where we know the pdf (=probability density function) of the experiment outcome.\
    It is the aleatoric kind of uncertainty (see [below](#aleo-pdf)) - we know the statistics, the counts, but not what one outcome is going to be in every one experiment.]{#know-pdf}

Uncertainty - obverse to knowing, to knowledge, lacking (perfect, deterministic) knowledge, we can think of types:

b.  [Aleatoric uncertainty means not being certain what the random sample drawn (from the probability distribution) will be: the p.d.f. is known, only point samples will be variable (but from that p.d.f.). We can actually reliably count the expected number of times an event will happen.]{#aleo-pdf}
c.  [Epistemic uncertainty is not being certain what the relevant probability distribution is: it is the p.d.f. that is unknown. We can\'t even reliably count the expected number of times an event will happen.]{#epi-unpdf}

The probabilistic knowledge of type [(b)](#know-pdf) above and aleatoric uncertainty of type [(b)](#aleo-pdf) are one and the same.

The 2D \\( (X,Y) \\) example is also useful to illustrate a further point. Once we observe \\( X \\), and work out the conditional pdf \\( f_Y(y\|x) \\), the question arises - what next? What do we do with it?

If \\( Y \\) is discrete, we have a problem of classification. If \\( Y \\) is continuous, we have a problem of regression.

We have the entire curve to work with - and that\'s the best. But often, we approximate the entire curve, with a representative value, and soldier on. Then the question becomes: well how do we chose one representative value from that curve?

The \"\\( X \\) observed \\( Y \\) not observed\" is arbitrary - it could be the other way around. We can generalize this by introducing a 2D binary **mask** \\( M \\), to indicate what parts of the vector \\( (X,Y) \\) are present (observed), and what parts are missing (and thus of some interest, e.g. we want to predict or forecast them).

With present data \\( X \\) and missing data \\( Y \\) in \\( (X,Y) \\), then missing data imputation is actually equivalent to forecasting regression or classification. The same logic works even if the mask is in time, but the signal gets much weaker when the observed parts are in the past and the unknown parts live in the future---time Now inserts another dimension that has to be overcome.

Simplest case - X is 1-dim, Y is 1-dim, then knowledge of a \\( (X,Y) \\) relationship is the joint p.d.f. \\( f\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\) that\'s a 3-D shape. **Observation** is cutting that 3-D shape with a 2-D plane \\( x=a \\). **Intelligence** is using the 2-D outline \\( f\_{X,Y}(x=a,y) \\) that\'s the intersection between the 3-D joint shape and the 2-D \\( x=a \\) plane, to decide on the action to be taken. Now we have this new(er) knowledge (that normalised to 1 is conditional p.d.f. \\( f\_{Y\|X}(y\|x=a) \\)), while still aiming for the same desired end as before.

Knowledge of relation \\( (X,Y) \\) is the joint p.d.f. \\( f\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\). Observation is cutting that 3-D shape with a 2-D plane \\( x=a \\). Intelligence is deciding on the next action---now we have 2-D shape \\( f\_{X,Y}(x=a,y) \\), incorporating this newest knowledge about X (normalised to sum 1 is the conditional p.d.f. \\( f\_{Y\|X}(y\|x=a) \\)). All the while still aiming towards the same desired goal as before. (the goals themselves are outside of this, are not considered)

Conditioning Y on X is observing the \\( x=a \\), and then re-normalising \\( f(y,x=a) \\) such that it becomes a p.d.f. again to sum to 1 \\( f(y\|x=a) \\). Observing quality X that is \\( x=a \\), is shrinking the dimensionality from 2D to 1D. In general from \\( (N+1) \\)-dim back to \\( N \\)-dim.

## Chain of Reasoning (CoR)

If p.d.f. \\( f\_{Y\|X}(y\|x=a) = P(Y\|X) \\) is not very informative, we can undertake **chain of reasoning (CoR)**. We can find a reasoning step \\( Z \\), that is \\( P(Z\|X) \\), such that the conditional \\( P(Y\|Z,X) \\) brings us closer to our end answer than \\( P(Y\|X) \\) can bring us.

This is how hierarchies are made. Already \\( P(Y\|X) \\) is a hierarchical relationship. Now conditioning on \\( Z \\) too, \\( P(Y\|Z,X) \\), is another brick in the wall of a hierarchical relationship. Conditioning on X takes general N-dim \\( P(X,Y) \\), and reduces it down to at most \\( (N-1) \\)-dim space of \\( P(Y\|X) \\). Conditioning even more on Z to \\( P(Y\|Z,X) \\) does another slicing down, to at most \\( (N-2) \\)-space. From widest most detailed N-dim \\( P(X,Y) \\), to more general less specific \\( P(Y\|Z,X) \\) at most \\( (N-2) \\)-dim.

One can undertake **motivated slicing via \\( Z \\)**. For slicing by \\( x=a \\) the \\( P(X,Y)=f\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\) to get \\( f\_{X,Y}(x=a,y) \\) (then renormalised by marginal \\( P(X)=f_X(x) \\) at \\( x=a \\) into \\( f\_{X,Y}(x=a,y)/f_X(x=a) = f\_{Y\|X}(y\|x=a) \\) call it conditional \\( P(Y\|X) \\)) - we undertake that b/c we hope \\( P(Y\|X) \\) is going to be sharper, more informative than a presumed wide un-informative \\( P(Y) \\). So we could be selecting such \\( Z \\), that \\( P(Y\|Z,X) \\) is even sharper. And we have the \\( P(Z\|X) \\) to judge how justified we are to undertake our motivated reasoning \\( Z \\) step.

There are infinite number of \\( Z \\)-s we can slice-condition on. The trick is choosing \"the right ones\" for \\( Z \\). They can\'t be too divorced from \\( X \\), as then \\( P(Z\|X) \\) will be very flat. The \\( Z \\) chosen also can\'t be too divorced from \\( Y \\) - then it will not add anything over and above \\( X \\), which is already too far from \\( Y \\) for any useful guide, \\( P(Y\|Z,X) \\) will be as good (bad) as \\( P(Y\|X) \\). (even if \\( P(Z\|X) \\) may show relation to X) Looks like the size of the step when moving X→Y can be max \~20% in interestingness, but not more, to keep it true.

**Chain of Thought (CoT), Chain of reasoning (CoR)**

Extension to Type 2 intelligence: guided search through discrete space where reward is unknown in time and only becomes known after the last step in the sequence. Next step from Type 1 intelligence: pattern recognition single 1:1 input:output, reward known at every step.

CoR now often has to invent its own \\( Z \\)-s (or \\( R \\)-s for \"reasons\"), rather than simply conditioning on an observed variable. DSPy-style systems optimise not only the answerer \\( P(Y\|X) \\) but the question-poser that proposes \\( Z \\) so \\( P(Y\|Z,X) \\) becomes sharp. Both the query and the answer become learnable objects.

Non-reasoning autoregressive LLM-s: compute \\( P(Y\|X) \\), then they sample from that distribution. Hence parameters like *temp-erature*, *top_K*, *min_p*, *top_p*.

Diffusion models image denoisers: learn the first derivative of \\( \\log(P(Y\|X)) \\), use that to get from the current sample, to a better sample, and they iterate. They add noise to in every step, and that serves to sample the whole distribution, rather than pick and converge to a single one point.

Afaics the reasoning models add only one step extra. Assume there is no good choice \\( Y \\) for the \\( X \\) - say \\( P(Y\|X) \\) is flat uninformative, there is no good guess for Y. So let\'s figure out intermediate step Z. Then instead of \\( P(Y\|X) \\), go after \\( P(Y\|Z,X)P(Z\|X) \\). NB summing over Z will recover exactly \\( P(Y\|X) \\). The step \\( Z \\) is such that \\( P(Y\|Z,X) \\) is informative, where \\( P(Y\|X) \\) was not. So \\( P(Y\|Z,X) \\) brings us closer to a better guess for \\( Y \\), in a way that \\( P(Y\|X) \\) does not. Of course, what functions, and how they are fit, and how to chose bazillion of \\( Z \\)-s, and how to aggregate while searching - makes a world of difference.

Diffusers learning gradients and autoregressors learning the density are complementary. If/when we have access to both the function and its derivatives we can approximate more operators on top of the pdf itself---think H- and L- updates that reason about how the entire distribution should morph in one step.

## Marginalisation is Forgetting

When I compute \\( f_X(x) = \\int f\_{X,Y}(x,y) dy \\) margnialising out i.e. \"ignoring\" Y is irreversibly destroying any knowledge of how X and Y co-vary. The operation is a lossy compression; I cannot reconstruct \\( f\_{X,Y} \\) from \\( f_X \\) alone. A state with joint knowledge \\( f\_{X,Y} \\) has \"working memory\" of the relationship. Marginalizing to \\( f_X \\) is forgetting Y, freeing up parameters space removing memory so losing specifics. Choosing which variable to marginalize is an act of attention allocation. Storing a joint p.d.f. over \\( (N+M) \\)-dims cost drops when marginalizing down to \\( N \\)-dim. We trade accuracy for efficiency, effectivelly compressing, so the trick is to forget just enough but not more than that. We pay for any complexity for memory of extra weights and for using them in the compute. So there is always cost. If removing the specifics, maybe b/c conditioning on those specifics barely changes the p.d.f, if we endup with almost the joint p.d.f. even in the conditional - the we lose almost nothing by the removal and save on processing and mainteinance costs.

Conversely each new variable introduced in the join p.d.f, that can be latter used for conditioning, enables for learning the particulars with more precision, enables drilling down. This extra extra dimension atm with our one-off learning will only latter be used for conditioning and nothing else. But we can imagine a case of continuous learning, like CoR, that seeks to find the right conditioning variables. Only in CoR this is just find some among the existing variables, while in continuous learning we will be creating a new axis of variance to be added to the joint p.d.f. and the joint p.d.f.will be modified. It doesn\'t have to be zero-one, on-off. It can be continuous and even naturally occuring. With passage of time, a conditioning variable is ever more blurred, it decays, the conditional p.d.f. conditioned on that variable is ever flatter, ever less informative. At some point we just delete that extra variable and nothign changes in the p.d.f, as by that point the conditional p.d.f. was so flat observing the variable made almost not difference to the joint p.d.f. We can imagine the opposite process too, in continuous learning. As we star with sharpish informative conditional p.d.f., we keep discovering ever more examples related to the variable we are conditioning on. Maybe each new conditioning step is a re-memoization (loosely reminiscent of DRAM, or the Hebbs rule) preventing forgetting by keeping another dimension intact. But we pay in costs - the cost of memoisation, and the cost of compute when used latter. So we better gain some from the extra varaible too.

## Appendices (other related randoms; TBD refactor when feel like)

### A. Everything is a Computer in 2025 it seems [+]{.sec-toggle aria-controls="appendix-a" aria-expanded="false"}

::: {#appendix-a hidden=""}
Everything is a computer now atm. (2025) Information theory is the most general theory we got.

Knowledge is a p.d.f. Learning is acquiring a p.d.f. where we previously lacked one. Acquiring p.d.f. is figuring out what-s, and how many-s of those what-s.

Computing is taking our knowledge, the learned p.d.f.s we got, then manipulating those p.d.f.s, by either marginalisation, or conditioning, to create new p.d.f.s.

These new p.d.f.s then tell us something about what we care about but we can\'t observe, having observed things that are easy for us to observe, but we don\'t care about.

The general model of computation is one of discrete states. Every state is characterised by a different p.d.f. function. Transitions between states occur too. Those are also characterised by their own p.d.f.s. Markov assumption is that transitions depend on the current state, but don\'t depend on the path we took to get to the current state. So the future states are independent of the past states, only on the present state.

Computation is to information p.d.f. \\( p=f(x,y,\...) \\) what physics is to space-time \\( (x,y,z,t) \\). Both have a "special" dimension: probability mass \\( p \\) that always stays \\( \\ge 0 \\), and time \\( t \\) that only flows forward. Transformations manipulate the rectangular coordinates while respecting that privileged axis.

Information and knowledge move against entropy by copying and spreading. When information spreads from A to B, B gains knowledge, but A does not lose it---the operation is copy, not move. What costs energy is the physical act of copying.

### B. Missing Data Imputation [+]{.sec-toggle aria-controls="appendix-b" aria-expanded="false"}

::: {#appendix-b hidden=""}
With present data \\( x \\) and missing data \\( y \\) in \\( (x,y) \\), then missing data imputation is actually equivalent to forecasting regression (continuous \\( y \\) variable) or classification (discrete \\( y \\) classes). Big difference is whether \\( x \\) and \\( y \\) are contemporaneous, or not: not contemporaneous makes the signal connection \\( x \\rightarrow y \\) much, much weaker, by orders of magnitude. Time Now is a big barrier in knowing.

The mask view \\( M \\) above is the operational view of imputation. Once the mask is defined, we simply treat the missing cells as \\( Y \\) and the present ones as \\( X \\), and the whole machinery of conditional pdfs applies.

Once we have any curve \\( f_Z(z) \\) whichever way we got it (marginal, conditional), we can do derived statistics to it, in order to convert the curve into one (point forecast) or two (forecast and it\'s variation) points or however many we fancy (quartiles, quintiles, etc) to characterise the entire curve/area/volume/Nvolume (1D/2D/3D/Ndim) with, and reduce to characterise the whole continuous mathematical object with few discrete numbers.

So we have past and future separated by the now that marks the present for us. Say \\( X = \\) past, \\( Y = \\) future in our \\( (X,Y) \\) and we have the p.d.f. \\( f\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\).

The *past* has already happened, there is only one of it, it\'s certain and deterministic. Translated in p.d.f. language that means the \\( f_X(x) \\) or \\( f\_{X\|Y}(x\|y) \\) distribution **\*must\*** be a Dirac delta impulse. The \\( f_X(x) \\) can not be any other function shape than a Dirac delta.

The *future* has not happened yet. We know there two or more options for the future, it is never a single one. Translated in p.d.f. language that means the \\( f_Y(y) \\) or \\( f\_{Y\|X}(y\|x) \\) distribution **\*can NOT\*** be a Dirac delta impulse. The \\( f_Y(y) \\) can be any other function shape than a Dirac delta. But not a Dirac delta.

*Now* is a moving boundary between the all-Dirac past, and never-Dirac future. Living is the future out-running the past, the past failing to catch up the future. Death is the point at which the past finally catches up with the future. At that point all uncertainty ends, seemingly never to return back. Death collapses the future functions (p.d.f.s) from general forms with uncertainty (anything but Dirac Delta-s), into a Dirac Delta impulse. The uncertainty ends, the Past finally catches up with the Future, erasing the Now time boundary in the process. For self anyways. I detach from not-I completely irreversibly, the final separation.

Time is the special dimension on which everything we can imagine---real or counterfactual---happens. Time gives rise to the idea of infinity and, symmetrically, conceiving infinity gives rise to time: we imagine \\( N \\), then \\( N+1 \\), and so on, never ending. That mental sequence is how we make the jump from discrete to continuous.

Time as sequence of events is the counter that labels the observations; it is not itself modelled by a joint conditional p.d.f. Time must be discrete for counting to occur. A perfectly continuous time would defeat counting (what does "next" mean?). Discreteness hints the underlying latent space is very high-dimensional.

Time makes the jump from discrete to continuous space possible. When we imagine bisecting an interval for the \\( N \\)-th time, we also imagine the \\( (N+1) \\)-st time. Memory of \\( (N-1,N,N+1) \\) suffices, yet without that memory the limit process would fall apart.

Both time and space implement memory. Patterns live in time; they require the medium of time to exist. Those patterns can be converted 1:1 into spatial states that memorize the same information. The existence of a discrete entity can be in time (patterns) or in space (states).

Markovian blanket = in the present, memorising everything from the past, that is to be used to forecast the future. Everything that can be determined about the future, from the past, is written onto the present.

Time is the currency of life - time is what is spent in the process of living.

### D. Forecasts must have error \> 0 for information to exist [+]{.sec-toggle aria-controls="appendix-d" aria-expanded="false"}

::: {#appendix-d hidden=""}
The error is necessary for information to exist. In the limit where the error is zero, no new information is ever observed - everything is known, the uncertainty is zero.

Life exists only with uncertainty. Where/when the error is zero, everything is predictable. This is the state before a living thing is born, and after a living thing dies.

Life exists in that goldilocks region where there is limited uncertainty. If the uncertainty is zero, then we are not-born yet, or dead. If the uncertainty is too high, things are chaotic, too random, there isn\'t enough order and structure for life to exist.

Every living thing introduces another dimension, another axis, of non-zero uncertainty, into existence. When it dies, the uncertainty disappears, that axis of variance is no more.

In physics disorder (entropy) is something we measure at macro level as temperature. It is typically increased by adding energy. So - energy increases temperature increases entropy increases disorder increases error decreases predictability.

### E. Qualities, Quantities, and Dimensions [+]{.sec-toggle aria-controls="appendix-e" aria-expanded="false"}

::: {#appendix-e hidden=""}
**Quality and quantity.** Dimensions \\( (X,Y) \\) are qualities, and we quantify them each too. When do we add new quality and obversely when do we lose a quality (dimension)? ([LJ @ HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38261719)) The second "law" of dialectical materialism by Engels---\"the law of the passage of quantitative changes into qualitative changes\"---captures this nicely. Enough quantity becomes a new quality.

Suppose I have a 5-dimensional observation and I\'m wondering if it\'s really only 4 dimensions there. One way I check is - do a PCA, then look at the size of the remaining variance along the axis that is the smallest component (the one at the tail end, when sorting the PCA components by size). If the remaining variance is 0 - that\'s easy, I can say: well, it was only ever a 4-dimensional observation that I had after all. However, in the real world it\'s never going to be exactly 0. What if it is 1e-10? 1e-2? 0.1? At what size does the variance along that smallest PCA axis count as an additional dimension in my data? The thresholds are domain dependent - I can for sure say that enough quantity in the extra dimension gives a rise to that new dimension, adds a new quality. Obversely - diminishing the (variance) quantity in the extra dimension removes that dimension eventually (and with total certainty at the limit of 0). I can extend the logic from this simplest case of linear dependency (where PCA suffices) all the way to to the most general case where I have a general program (instead of PCA) and the criterion is predicting the values in the extra dimension (with the associated error having the role of the variance in the PCA case). At some error quantity \\( \\gt 0 \\) I have to admit I have a new dimension (quality).

Emergence, phase transition and similar: 1) where quantity is large enough (this condition is necessary but not sufficient) and becomes new quality 2) thus this new quality becomes a new dimension in the phenomenon investigated, so my observations data from N-dim vectors become (N+1)-dim. \"More is Different\" is a succinct summary of \"enough quantity becomes a new quality\".

An image is worth 16×16 words, but a program is worth \\( 2\^4 \\) images. Kolmogorov complexity says a learning system finds the shortest program that explains the data. Compression is learning. A forecasting error of quantity \\( \>0 \\) is the extra dimension---new quality---waiting to be captured. When the program makes perfectly accurate predictions, that dimension disappears or was never there.

**TBD Ndim Space.** Ratio of Ncube/Nball. Does our intuition fail us about the representative values of a distribution when we go from low \\( N \\) \\( (N = 2) \\) to high(er) \\( N \\) \\( (N \\gt 10) \\)? For large N, Nspace in Ndim: (a) moves into the edges (b) every observation is an outlier (in some dimension). Does that mean the space becomes discrete, it discretizes?

TBD Sparse representation, moving to symbolics and rules. Once the Ndim vector becomes sparse, we move from continuous representations to discrete symbolic rules. That's when we start writing down the rules explicitly.

*Deciding on whether to create/introduce a new conditioner/dimension/variable/quality in the joint p.d.f. - yes or no, considerations*

**Laplace's rule of succession.** From Tom Davidson at <https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Tg5pQCjpefFiqaKjw/limitations-of-laplace-s-rule-of-succession>. The general pattern is that if some trend has been going for N years, Laplace's rule says there's a 1/(N+2) probability the trend is broken next year and a 50% chance the trend continues for another N+1 years or more. Or if some event hasn't happened for N years, Laplace's rule says there's a 1/(N+2) probability the event happening next year and a 50% chance the event doesn't happen another N+1 years or more. Limitation: for N=0 the probability is 1/2 and that maybe a big overstatement. It typically overestimates the chance of unprecedented events occurring. In general, the problem is that Laplace's rule excludes evidence we already have at the start time about how likely something is to occur.

**Lindy effect.** *(deciding to create new conditioner/dimension/variable/quality-2)* From John D. Cook at <https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2012/12/17/the-lindy-effect/>. Lifetimes of intellectual artifacts follow power law distribution. Assume survival time is a random variable X with a Pareto distribution with p.d.f \\( f(t) = c / t\^{c+1} \\) for \\( t≥1, c\>0 \\). A power law because in that p.d.f. the probability (density) is proportional to power of t. If \\( c \> 1 \\), then expected \\( X \\) is \\( E\\{X\\} = c / (c-1) \\). Conditional expectation of \\( X \\) given \\( X \\) survived time \\( k \\) to now is \\( E\\{ X \| X\>k \\} = ck/(c-1) \\). So expected additional life for \\( X \\) is \\( ck/(c-1) -- k = k/(c-1) \\) and is proportional to the amount of life \\( k \\) seen so far. If \\( c = 2 \\), the expected additional life equals the life seen so far.

### F. Randomness, Search, and Open-Endedness [+]{.sec-toggle aria-controls="appendix-f" aria-expanded="false"}

::: {#appendix-f hidden=""}
Randomness, entropy is what enables search. Random steps are a way of searching through the global space. Without randomness we hill-climb to the nearest peak and stay there forever; the derivatives decay to zero, motion stops, intelligence halts.

There is no AI/ML without randomness: (1) Autoregressive LLM sampling---temperature, top_k, etc.--- prevent robotic outputs. (2) SGD uses noisy mini-batches; warnings about local minima never materialized because the noise keeps us moving. (3) Diffusion models follow the log conditional probability gradient but also add noise so they don\'t collapse to a single sample.

That what works will keep being done, and finally will be overdone. Then things need to change in order for them to stay the same. It\'s the dose that makes the poison: noise too small and we stagnate, too large and the structure dissolves.

Randomness is the source of uncertainty and therefore information. Random steps implement global search instead of local greedy search. Trial and error equals variation and selection: trial == variation, error == selection.

Open endedness in that way is reminiscent of the diffusion sampling, and the role the noise term plays. If we add too much noise, the denoising fails. Too little noise, and the steps are tiny, nothing new is learned. The step needs to be just right---not too small, not too large. Kelly-criterion thinking says we should keep \\( \\mu/\\sigma \\lesssim 0.2 \\) for comfortable compounding (halve the leverage when uncertain). That heuristics rhymes with how CoR steps are ideally "only" 20% more interesting than the previous step.

Kelly criterion leverage: \\( f = \\mu / \\sigma\^2 \\). Assume errors in \\( (\\mu,\\sigma) \\) estimates =\> deploy half-kelly leverage \\( f=\\mu/\\sigma\^2/2 \\). Market neutral fund leverage 3 origin: assume average \\( \\mu=2\\% \\) \\( \\sigma=4\\% \\) p.a. on gross book, so half-kelly leverage \\( f=0.02/0.04\^2/2=6.25 \\), so with capital \\( C=1 \\), aim for \\( (\\text{Long}=3,\\text{Short}=-3) (\\text{Gross}=6,\\text{Net}=0) \\) book.

Sufficiently high frequency feels smooth. Once the frequency is high enough, the alternation peak-trough merge into a constant line. Infinite frequency == zero period == DC no alternation.

### G. Life, Entropy, Knowledge, Intelligence [+]{.sec-toggle aria-controls="appendix-g" aria-expanded="false"}

::: {#appendix-g hidden=""}
Definions of life collected over time from various sources.

Life as Thermodynamic Evidence of Algorithmic Structure in Nature (2012) (mdpi.com). Organisms encode information about their environment in order to survive. The encoding costs energy and generates entropy. Organisms use that encoded information to gain or not lose energy. Only where the information cycle is net positive can life exist. Since life exists, nature cannot be "too unpredictable".

Living things decrease entropy; non-alive things increase entropy. (\"What is Life?\" by Erwin Schrodinger <http://www.whatislife.ie/downloads/What-is-Life.pdf>) Life is that what decreases entropy. (is this only taking into account the living thing only, within the boundary of it? b/c outside - the disorder may as well increase?)

Life is in a goldlocks region between max uncertainty (random, entropy) and min uncertainty (Dirac delta): not too random, not too certain, just right random/certain as to be interesting.

In order to achieve entropy decrease, life needs to exercise 1) control, and 2) adaptation. Control starts with enclosure. A piece of space is enclosed using a membrane, a barrier, a border. The inside of the barrier needs to gain enough negative entropy, so to sustain itself and the wall. Adaptation is achieved with intelligence.

All living things are part of the tree of life. They are all related. So the life-o-sphere is expanding. One can think of life-o-sphere as a whole as a giant organism that is living.

Atoms are only ever created and destroyed in rare nuclear reactions. Most of the time they are just reconfigured like Lego blocks. The atoms that make our bodies were lent to us. Atoms themselves are mostly empty space with smaller vibrating sub-particles. The relations between particles matter more than the particles themselves---like letters versus words.

Life is self‐reproduction with variation. Life is ability to make decisions about the future and take action, and thus influence and change your own future. Intelligent life in biological sense is the ability to achieve the same goal via differing paths, different means.

Life is recurring pattern. Joscha Bach \"We Are All Software\". We recognise the same person even if all molecules churned many times. The pattern repeats over time even if the details differ.

Life is a cycle of generation, degeneration, regeneration. \"I\" is a collection of particles that is arranged into this pattern, that will decompose and be available to nature to reorganize into another pattern. Death is part of a gift economy. You are given this enormous gift, life. You enrich it as best you can. And then you give it back. (Emily Levine, Andreas Weber). Children give you a glimpse of a second life, if not of an eternal one.

#### Intelligence

One definition of intelligence I\'ve heard is: \"intelligence is the computational part of achieving a goal\". And what is the goal of anything that\'s alive? The goal is to continue staying alive. Otherwise it dies and then stays dead forever. Short term we adapat to the enviroenment, and we adapt the environment to us. Long term we im-perfectly replicate, create im-perfect partial copies of ourselves. (could say \"it\'s the recipe for replication that replicates, our bodies are the material realisations of that machine\"; dependnt of what we take to be \"I\") Stupid systems found in nature are never living - always dead. Can safely infer: \"if alive =\> then not-stupid but intelligent\"? Reality has that search built in apparently.

Intelligence definitions over/heard or read over time, short enough to be collected:

- Behaving like a person. (Turing test)
- The ability to acquire and apply knowledge and skills. (dictionary)
- Attaining consistent ends by variable means. (William James, psychology)
- The computational part of the ability to achieve goals. (John McCarthy, AI)
- Ability to acquire capability - efficiently. (Challet)
- Doing more with less. (David Krakauer)

Looks to me the way we adapt to the environment, and the way we adapt the environment, we achieve that by having a model of the environment, and a model of ourselves - in our heads. Then we forecast into the future, make a prediction. Then the future happens, and we get the ground truth from the reality around us. Then we compute the difference, the error, and try to reduce it: both by changing the model in our head to be a better predictor of the future, and by activelly changing the future by changing our environment too. Afaik this is what Fristons theories are about. Last I heard it on this Joscha Bach [interview](https://www.appblit.com/scribe?v=dP4VlkSa87c&t=1578&g=d5SXWH6eCJMsc5ZyO7M7DtKSTak2) (\"Building an AGI to Play the Longest Games\"; Worthy Successor, [Episode 6.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dP4VlkSa87c&t=1578s) The Trajectory with Dan Faggella) Makes total sense to me.

### H. Brains, AIs, and Efficiency [+]{.sec-toggle aria-controls="appendix-h" aria-expanded="false"}

::: {#appendix-h hidden=""}
Digital intelligences (currently AI-s - artificial intelligences) need lots of energy. They can work \"as if\" perfect copies, separating software (spirit) from the hardware (substrate). They can all learn different knowledge from different experiences, but then share their knowledge back with everyone at high speed. So they can implement distributed learning at unit level. Separation s/w spirit from h/w substrate also makes them immortal.

Analogue intelligences (currently HI - human intelligences; but all animales and plants, all life really) can not work \"as if\" perfect copies, they are all one of a kind and unique. Their spirit s/w and their substrate h/w are entangled. They can\'t share their experiences easily. They are mortal, their spirit s/w stops existing when their substrate h/w dies. However, they have one big advantage: they use much less energy, orders of magnitude less energy than digital intelligences.

Energy lots of it is used to create the insulation of s/w spirit separate from h/w substrate. So digital intelligence being high energy, can\'t bootstrap itself 0-\>1 into being on its own. For that, only low energy is possible. And low energy implies analogue intelligence. So the bootstrapping of intelligence goes none -\> analogue (low energy) -\> digital (high energy).

Assume learning for 30 yrs \~ \\(10\^9\\) sec, visual processing sampling at 10 fps, that equals \\(10\^{10}\\) images as training samples. Assuming training a human brain with \\(10\^{13}\\) \"parameters\" (100B neurons × 100 connections). That makes 1 image per \\(10\^3\\) parameters. Meanwhile our best ANN-s train with way more images per parameter---they trade computation and data for smaller models, while biological brains sacrifice parsimony in weights to gain speed and low power.

Energy and intelligence travel together. Intelligence figures out what to do; energy is what gets it done in the physical world.

### I. Collective Intelligence and Networks [+]{.sec-toggle aria-controls="appendix-i" aria-expanded="false"}

::: {#appendix-i hidden=""}
All intelligence is collective intelligence. Humans are collections of organs and tissues, which themselves are collections of cells. A cell is itself a collection of molecular networks (and so on). The subunits are competent themselves. There is a scale up process in which these competent subunits give rise to an intelligent unit bigger than themselves (Michael Levin).

The value---and even the reality itself!---is in the connections, not the nodes. People move from villages to cities because density breeds civilization. Empires built trading outposts to create connections. Roman logistics favoured water routes because the connections mattered more than the raw distance. Value of a network scales with \\( N\^2 \\) not \\( N \\): the value is in the connections.

Mode of operation online vs offline diverges. Online geeks tend to cooperate in good-good positive sum interactions. Offline scarcity sometimes locks people into bad-good zero-sum trades. The larger, looser internet neighborhoods proved fertile for altruistic building of the web, Wikipedia, blogs, AI. Knowledge sharing thrives where connections are abundant.

Neural Networks architecture (N nodes of about the same power, with connections arcs between them scaling \\( N\^2 \\)) implementing Parallel Distributed Processing implementing intelligence - should be a grander lesson. Having a single node that is much more powerful than the rest is how cancer behaves. Intelligent systems survive by distributing power.

NB that any graph of N nodes can be described by a matrix \\( \[N \\times N\] \\). The graph operations are matrix operations---matrix multiplication implies a linear model at the base.

NB the standard deviation and risk as measured by it only goes down with \\( \\sqrt{N} \\) the number of samples. So having the collective intelligence go up with \\( N\^2 \\) the number of nodes counter-acts that. An individual node may sharpen its pdf with \\( \\sqrt{n} \\) data (and suffers curse of dimensionality). The system as a whole fights that by increasing \\( N \\) and the intelligence with \\( N\^2 \\).

N\^2 mechanism that makes the network powerful is sharing of knowledge, that all N see what 1 sees. So it\'s enough for every one of the N to see \\( 1/N \\) of the data in \\( 1/N \\) of the time, and to then share it with N others. So then all N get to see and learn whole data N. So the total knowledge is N, and is shared N times (redundancy), and that happens \\( 1/N \\) of the time---if the transfer of knowing between the N nodes is fast.

The real world can\'t be sped up. So the only way to speed up is to divide the work, get them to do the work in \\( 1/N \\) of the time, and then share the knowing between themselves.

### J. Types of Intelligence [+]{.sec-toggle aria-controls="appendix-j" aria-expanded="false"}

::: {#appendix-j hidden=""}
It\'s by logic that we prove, but by intuition that we discover. (Poincaré) To know how to criticize is good, to know how to create is better.(François Chollet)

Broadly three categories of problem solving patterns \-- recitation, intuition, and reasoning. Recitation: you simply recognize a known problem and apply the steps you\'ve learned. Like playing a chess opening. Recitation is a database lookup. Intuition: in the face of a novel situation, you pattern-match it to what you\'ve encountered before and you \"just know\" what to do. Like a very experienced chess player seeing the best move in \<1s. Reasoning: you consciously and deliberately analyze a novel situation, using a combination of abstract principles and step-by-step simulation. Like analyzing a chess position and simulating in your mind possible future trajectories.

Types of intelligence-s, (T-s): Type-1 pattern recognition, idea generation, guessing a not insane guess. Type-2 logical thinking, guided search through discrete space. Type-3 open endedness, directed but almost random hypothesis generation (active learning). Type-4 collective intelligence---AI-s coordinating (sometimes cooperating, sometimes competing) in AI society---where individual irrational behaviour aggregates into rational group-level feelings.

We share the meta-learning and meta-knowledge machinery with every other living thing: we\'re leaves on the same tree of life. We are made of collective intelligences (cells, made of molecules\...) and simultaneously build a collective intelligence (society). Human intelligence---and its stupidity---is collective too.

We live Type-3 intelligence whenever we seek novelty and interestingness. Having children brings that home: watching them learn to move, to speak, to press a button and discover a song. At first the joint p.d.f. \\( p(\\text{press button}, \\text{song plays}) \\) is flat. The first time, surprise! High residual error. So the kid repeats it four or five times until the distribution bumps up, the error shrinks toward zero, and knowing solidifies.

Type-4 intelligence is synchronizing with others---cooperation and competition at maybe 4:1---to build collective intelligence. Here emotions appear. They are mostly about other people, not much about self; introspection exists, but it is a small slice. Daniel Kahneman's "Thinking Fast and Slow" fits: Type-1 pattern recognition, Type-2 reasoning, plus these social Types 3 &iamp; 4 layered above.

Chains-of-Reasoning (CoR) is Type-2 reasoning layered on top of Type-1 N-gram guessing. Type-3 will graft naturally on Type-2: active learning with just-right steps (again that \\( \\mu/\\sigma \\le 0.2 \\) intuition). Type-4 collective intelligence pulls in social dynamics; we will want AI-s to have warm feelings toward humans and other carbon-based life forms.

Motivations behind \"possibly \\( \\mu/\\sigma \\lt 0.2 \\)\": (a) Kelly betting gives tolerable approximation errors when \\( \\mu/\\sigma \\) is small, hence the comfort zone above. (b) Distilling a smaller network from a bigger one typically lets us shrink by \~20% once the bigger one groks the pattern. (c) Bolting CoR onto a base language model often nets \~20% uplift. The same ratio pops up across scaling laws.

### L. Consciousness [+]{.sec-toggle aria-controls="appendix-l" aria-expanded="false"}

::: {#appendix-l hidden=""}
**Connection to consciousness.** Not a lot specifically, nothing over and above what\'s true of the brain as per the writing of Karl Friston (of his work I became aware recently; video <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iPj9D9LgK2A>, text [https://www.wired.com/story/karl-friston-free-energy-principle-artificial-intelligence/](https://archive.is/AngqY#selection-2139.0-2139.15); shortest summary \"brain machine works by minimising the discrepancy error between model forecast and observation by better model and/or action in the world\", aka \"minimize free energy\" principle). But had to write some recently, [so here](post-consciousness.html).

One view that seems testable to me: consciousness is like the conductor in the orchestra, it\'s the router in an Mixture of Experts model. Consciousness module is the router in MoE. Experts in the MoE are the individual members of the orchestra, every one playing their own instrument. So while the router is not a very big or a very special module (in fact - it\'s in many ways simpler then the specialised modules) - it\'s *a single point of failure*. So once consciousness (in HI brain) / router (in IA MoE) fails - no expert can learn properly, or even if the experts learns, the knowledge can not be utilised.

MoE architecture is the reason why it\'s so data efficient. Sparse representations, by virtue of injecting that prior knowledge in the process (\"these connections for this data do not need updating\"), can be data efficient. It\'s efficient to know in advance \"this data is no use to Experts 1,3,4,5, and is to be used to reach only Expert#2\". MoE maybe a reason why we have too many neurons. Our brains are less efficient than NN-s when it comes to utilising their weight. NN-s are much more efficient than us humans, when looking at efficiency in weights sizes space. Our brains trade parsimony in weights space, to gain efficiencies to gain speed and reduce power consumption - both achieved by MoE.

Further: sparse representations (and MoE is a macro-scale example) may make incremental learning, which is one way to implement continuous learning, practically doable. If only a limited set of weight need to be updated, for the brain to acquire new memory or knowledge, that means it can be done without losing all other previous memory or knowledge.

### M. Etc [+]{.sec-toggle aria-controls="appendix-m" aria-expanded="false"}

**Information can reduce knowledge**Amusing paper illustrates how new/more information can make the entropy (uncertainty) higher, thus reducing our knowledge. Where our knowledge measure is the spikiness of the probability density function. After the additional observation (new information), the conditional p.d.f. post the observation is flatter then before =\> our knowledge about the world decreased.

Michael R DeWeese and Markus Meister (1999), [\"How to measure the information gained from one symbol\"](DeWeese_Meister_-_How_to_measure_the_information_gained_from_one_symbol_-_ne9403.pdf), [Network: Computation in Neural Systems, 10:4, 325-340](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1088/0954-898X_10_4_303), [DOI: 10.1088/0954-898X/10/4/303](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/0954-898X/10/4/303)

The paper contains an example along the lines of: let\'s say I want to know if I have cancer or not right now. Let\'s assume that for my demographics, the chances of cancer at my age are 5%. So I can be reasonably sure that I have not got cancer (95%). Now I do a test, and the result comes back positive. Now - we know that half of the people that test positive turn out to have cancer for real, and the other half are false positives. After the test, my chances are 50:50 - I\'m perfectly ignorant! Whereas before the test, I was fairly certain I have not got cancer. So the *new information* provided by the test, it *reduced my knowledge*: from almost certain, do perfectly ignorant.

**Incomplete theory?** In betting when quant trading, we don\'t just take the point forecast (e.g. mean \\( \\mu \\) ) and run with it. We take into account the 2nd moment \\( \\sigma \\), some measure of variability around the 1st moment, as our measure of risk. We use it to counter-balance using the first moment in point forecast with e.g. \\( \\mu - \\sigma\^2/2 \\), or as part of a constraint on the size of the bet we will place. This is to express that we have at least two objectives. Yes we want to make earn \$\$\$ (#2), but in order to do that, we have to stay alive (#1). We need to live to trade another day. Going bust is a game over, once we stop trading on day \\( 50 \\), there is not trading on days \\( 51, 52 \... 100 \\) anymore. Our game is non-ergodic: a \\( 1..100 \\) sequence in time can not be replaced by ensamble of 100 copies of *us* in 1 time moment - that would imply independence. But us staying alive to trade day 100, depends on doing the same on days \\( 1, 2 \... 99 \\).

I like the Theory of Information finally gifted to us by [Shannon](https://people.math.harvard.edu/~ctm/home/text/others/shannon/entropy/entropy.pdf) in the 20-th century. But sometimes I think that it\'s more restrictive than it needs to be. Every result has a real physical embodiment, we could run an experiment, count, and see with our eyes that our intermediate result in a long chain of derivations holds (is true). That\'s great, but maybe an overkill - the theory doing more than it needs to. Because often we don\'t care about intermediate results, it\'s not a must that intermediate results have physical interpretation. We really only care about the start, and the end - don\'t care about the middle. The theory needs to work in the middle, but the practice doesn\'t need to. E.g. we happily run with complex numbers, and they make things previously impossible to compute - possible. And yet - we don\'t stop and requite 1:1 correspndence with reality at every step. It suffices that the 1st and the last step have mapping to reality. The intermediate steps - they don\'t need to. E.g. using complex numbers in Fourer Transform in signal processing. Or using 1000s-dimensional vector spaces that we can\'t even imagine, and certanily can\'t see. There are concepts like \'confidence\' supplementing \'forecast\' probailities, that are not as straightforward to express in the current framework as one would hope. Maybe [extension to complex probabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03759), or even just [ingenious](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02901) [tricks](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2512.07525), will come to be helpful and useful? TBS

Another unaddressed issue by the Theory of Information has always been - model size, how much data can support how big a model, or more general - model discovering structure in the data, HOWTO. The way we do model sizing by trial an error, and without much useful theory we can apply, always felt unsatisfactory. (\'make the model smallest it can be, but not smaller\' - is the extent of the help we practitioners get) It\'s delightful when the issue pops up even in ordinary computer use with puzzled users \"why can\'t I zip my zip file again, and shrink it even more??\" 😅 Recent interesting read [From Entropy to Epiplexity: Rethinking Information for Computationally Bounded Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03220) - TBS if anything practical transpires.

# ML LLM Dev Links and Notes of resources of interest

## Dev, LLM code writing, Agents - coding agents

It turned out coding agents are the 2nd big LLM killer-app. A wide application area with huge unserved demand. The moment people started mass copy-pasta code to-fro chat-gpt, was the moment we all realised: ah-haa! Why do people go through all the trouble, jump through hoops, inconveniences etc, to do that? Because they found it useful! I did it too, I too found it better than the alternatives: 1) coding for myself, solo, me-myself-and-I alone wiht my-code (now), and 2) pestering colleagues to read, them being grumpy the same way I\'m grumpy when my attentiion is dragged from writing what interests me, into reading something else someone else wrote what interests them. Thrashing my context inthe process. :-)

The agents have been tremendous success and seen tremendous progress. I\'m amazed. I got \$250 free CC-web credits when subscribing to a new Anthropic \$20/mo sub, and proceed to run Cluade Code - Web for 2 weeks now on-and-off. This was CC running on a virtual box somewhere in the cloud, and communicating via github push/pull and web gui. All the while running Curson for my day job - with the RL trained internal model that\'s both fast and good, it\'s a breeze to use. Then there are random CC session on demand in the terminal.

At the start of Oct-2025 codex became so good, that every time I have an idea, I just open a terminal in a directory, and run codex: I command the codex, codex commands the command line. 😆 For me AGI arrived with codex-5-high. I\'m loving that socratic dialogue became the new programming. 🥰 In a dialogue between myself and codex, a set of actions emerges materialises somehow, and the job is done. 🤯 In this New-as-old world, we got Chat-as-programming, Dialogue-as-code, LLM-as-cpu, Context-as-ram. Once the QA session exhausts what was on my mind, I pause Ctrl-Z codex into background. On the next session, I continue summon codex back in the foreground with \$ fg, and continue from where we stopped last time.

In VSCode I got Cline using OpenAI API on localhost:1234 served by LMStudio. Recently got plessantly surprised to find out both got streaming support for MiniMax-M2 xml based use of tools. Did not expect that! And before that got Claude Code in terminal to use local LLM served by LMStudio. Vai e local litellm proxy running in docker and translating between Antropic API CC wants, and the OpenAI API LMStudio provides.

## Coding agents - local in terminal without sweat, opencode + MiniMax-M2.1 ftw (Jan-2026) {#latest-greatest}

Current best local coder on my againig mbp (m2, 96gb ram) is [OSS agent](https://github.com/anomalyco/opencode) [[opencode]{.kbd}](https://opencode.ai/) with OSS weights MoE model [MiniMax-M2.1](https://huggingface.co/MiniMaxAI/MiniMax-M2.1) by [MiniMax AI](https://www.minimax.io/). The model [quants](https://unsloth.ai/docs/basics/unsloth-dynamic-2.0-ggufs) are by [Unsloth](https://unsloth.ai/) [MiniMax-M2.1-GGUF]{href\"https:="" huggingface.co="" unsloth="" minimax-m2.1-gguf\"=""} served from [HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/) - a single 55GB file [MiniMax-M2.1-UD-TQ1_0.gguf](https://huggingface.co/unsloth/MiniMax-M2.1-GGUF/blob/main/MiniMax-M2.1-UD-TQ1_0.gguf).

The agent, the model, the end point, the interleaved thinking and the tools use - it \*just runs\*! 🤯 Unbelieveable. I get 10-20 tok/s on average, the longer the context the closer to 10 tok/s. The config is simply:

\

    $ cat ~/.config/opencode/opencode.json
    {
        "$schema": "https://opencode.ai/config.json",
        "provider": {
            "LMStudio": {
                "npm": "@ai-sdk/openai-compatible",
                "name": "LMStudio",
                "options": {
                    "baseURL": "http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1"
                },
                "models": {
                    "limi-air": {
                        "name": "limi-air"
                    },
                    "tongyi-deepresearch-30b-3b": {
                        "name": "tongyi-deepresearch-30b-3b"
                    },
                    "minimax-m2.1": {
                        "name": "minimax-m2.1"
                    }
                }
            }
        },
        "model": "LMStudio/minimax-m2.1"
    }

No special gymnastics or incantations needed - all runs out of the box. [LMStudio](https://lmstudio.ai/) provides the end point the agent talks to on http://127.0.0.1:1234. Looking at the chat traffic agent-LLM is fun. 😊

## Coding agents - local in terminal, factory.ai-s droid (Nov-2025)

Heh - turns out eavesdropping on \@FactoryAI droid talk to \@lmstudio is not only useful but tremendous fun! Who knew?? 😂 The model/agent interaction is oft - \'were you raised by wolves, you two, per chance??\' 😄 Really? You thought \'\$ mkdir /Project\' will work, that\'s the way to go? fr! ffs Seems droid does not realise it was started in the \'current project directory\' to make things easier for it. Do people usually launch their agent on Mars, while wanting it to edit files on Earth??

All these xml-like conversations remind me - the language spoken (the protocol) needs to be human readable. And even better if reading well than poorly. Internet - in addition to being free - IETF very early on cottoned on the fact \"no human readable -\> no human will get interested -\> no one to make it work -\> stays cr\*p and dies for lack of use\". So one could follow SMTP, POP3 and be not only readable, but read oh-key at leasat in not excellent. Formalisation of these things into some xml monstrosity is good when teaching principles to students. It\'s bad if used in actual practice. Much better to in practice make use of every nook and cranny to your advantage, use any accidental twist and turn, to make things more efficient, easier etc. UTF-8 backward compatible variable length encoding comes to mind.

The setup is as straightforward as it gets. For Droid I used

\

    $ cat ~/.factory/config.json
    {
      "custom_models": [
        {
          "model_display_name": "LMStudio/qwen3-30b-a3b-yoyo-v5",
          "model": "qwen3-30b-a3b-yoyo-v5-qx86-hi-mlx",
          "base_url": "http://localhost:1234/v1",
          "api_key": "sk",
          "provider": "generic-chat-completion-api",
          "max_tokens": 262144
        }
      ]
    }

then once in \$ droid, select with /model.

Once you confirm LM Studio is running and serving on port 1234, this should work!

So the model is <https://huggingface.co/nightmedia/Qwen3-30B-A3B-YOYO-V5-qx86-hi-mlx>, a quantisation of <https://huggingface.co/YOYO-AI/Qwen3-30B-A3B-YOYO-V5>, derived from joining of 3 Qwen3 models:

\

    Model tree for YOYO-AI/Qwen3-30B-A3B-YOYO-V5:
    Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Instruct-2507
    Qwen/Qwen3-30B-A3B-Thinking-2507 (a reasoning model)
    Qwen/Qwen3-Coder-30B-A3B-InstructModel 
    Highlights:
    * merge method: yoyo_fusion
    * precision: dtype: bfloat16
    * Context length: 262,144 & 1010000
    Parameter Settings: Temperature=0.7, TopP=0.8, TopK=20, MinP=0.

## Coding agents - fully local in VSCode Cline (Nov-2025)

LMStudio serving MiniMax-M2 that was shrunk so it fits in my mid-memory laptop. And LMStudio supports tools with thinking interleaved and streaming that MiniMax uses - no need to lobotomise the protocol. Then - Cline knows how to make use of that too! No litellm proxy needed. A model [minimax-m2-thrift-i1/MiniMax-M2-THRIFT.i1-IQ2_XXS.gguf](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/MiniMax-M2-THRIFT-i1-GGUF) that fits my VRAM and nothig else is needed - perfect! Not very fast though, and uses all of my 25 Watts on my years old MBP M2. :-) Still - pretty good. All local VSCode - Cline - LMStudio - MiniMax-M2-THRIFT.

## Coding agents - fully local in terminal, Claude Code via litellm proxy (Nov-2025)

Make Claude Code CLI use LMStudio served LocalLLM API to run LLM inference localhost. This worked for me on 8-Nov-2025. I followed [Setting Up Claude Code Locally with a Powerful Open-Source Model: A Step-by-Step Guide for Mac](https://medium.com/@luongnv89/setting-up-claude-code-locally-with-a-powerful-open-source-model-a-step-by-step-guide-for-mac-84cf9ab7302f) with minor changes.

The current working setup is described below. The model is Qwen3-30B-A3B-YOYO-V3-qx86-hi-mlx by nightmedia on Hugging Face <https://huggingface.co/nightmedia/Qwen3-30B-A3B-YOYO-V3-qx86-hi-mlx>.

#### 2. Ensure LMStudio is started, model loaded and running, and LMStudio is serving the default endpoint localhost:1234

![](LMStudio-YOYO-pic1.png){style="width: 75%; height: auto;"}

#### 3. Ensure the endpoint is reachable

    ljubomir@macbook2(::main):~$ curl http://localhost:1234/v1/models

        },
        .......

...and the fake key is "working" ok

\

#### 4. Start docker while being in the right dir

    ljubomir@macbook2(::):~/litellm$ docker compose up -d

and verify docker is running file - check some logs

\

    ljubomir@macbook2(::):~/litellm$ docker compose logs -f litellm

5\. Setup the right env vars for Claude code, and start Claude Code cli (CC-cli)

\

    ljubomir@macbook2(::):~/litellm$ source claude.env

## Coding agentss - in terminal

Current workflow is:

\

    # An Architect model is asked to describe how to solve the coding problem. Thinking/reasoning models often work well in this role.
    # An Editor model is given the Architect’s solution and asked to produce specific code editing instructions to apply those changes to existing source files.
    # https://aider.chat/2025/01/24/r1-sonnet.html
    aider-openrouter-best() {
      local -; set -x; env AIDER_START="$(date)";
      aider --architect --model openrouter/deepseek/deepseek-r1 --editor-model openrouter/anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet;
    }

\

Atm waiting on a glitch to resolve -

\

    architect> litellm.APIError: APIError: OpenrouterException - 
    Retrying in 0.2 seconds...
    litellm.APIError: APIError: OpenrouterException - 

\

\...and so I\'m realising now I more often then not now I have it write code for me.

It\'s not even that much faster atm tbh! By the time I have thought through, explained in detail in INSTRUCTIONS.md --- I could have read up the sources, the docs, and done it myself.

The only explanation I have to offer, that I only now---waiting on the OR api to come back---have, is: it\'s \*\*much more fun\*\*!! 😍

It\'s much more fun to have someone else write the code, and even if need be talk them into \"no no---not that way, change this, change that\", than to do everything myself solo and in silence!! 😆

Ok---this I did not expect. 😛 That the most entertaining---wins. 🙃

Is [vibing](#){onclick="toggleShowImage('vibe-coding-ftw-2025')"} the way code wring will scale x10, x100 next??

### LLMs for coding - pre-history, chatgpt copy-pasta

1.  Start with ChatGPT copy&pasta - works but limited & manual, little time saved.
2.  Onto Cursor - nice but not much gained, not even wrong.
3.  Over to aider cmd line - some result there, even if cr\*p result\... but looks like it could be improved?
4.  Current VSCode gui + Cline addon + OpenRouter payg credits + Claude model. Well hello!! Finally produced something not obviously wrong.

Until today the best I got was: in ChatGPT-o4/o1- etc, copy & paste code snippet(s), ask a Question, then incorporate the Answer in the soluton. So this was a replacement for 1) googling and reading web pages 2) search through Stackoverflow Q&A.

This is the 1st time I got code inserted in 3 files. That required AI to 1) read through 5-6 files 2) compare and contrast, reason by analogy 3) take my requirement Q in considerion 4) edit 3 files, delete some code, insert some other code.

I have my main codebase, about 200K LoC in an array/matrix language mostly, with some C/C++/bash/awk/sql too.

I\'m agnostic Re: tools. Fallback always available is bash/vim/Makefile/gcc/g++/gdb/ddd/shell/\... tools. But if IDE like VSCode/Spyder/CLion/Matlab/DBeaver is available - I\'m happy to use. As long as it\'s not exlcusive, and one can edit/setup outside the IDE too. And esp important version contol - git now, prev hg, cvs, Teams. If that works - then all is good.

I tried Cursor. That looked hopeful, but did not get me results. I didn\'t like not being able to use existing API subscriptions in it. Also them using some kind of LLM in-house undocumented bodge. (I maybe wrong/maybe possible - didn\'t try too hard)

I then tried aider, a command line tool. That managed mutiple edits, but to not too good results. Waste of time wrt results, but: it was a good learning curve for me. I PAYG subscribed OpenAI -\> DeepSeek -\> OpenRouter.

OpenRouter leader board led me to Cline VSCode addon. Latest-greatest setup atm 1) VSCode 2) with Cline Addon 3) OpenRouter API key (payg credits) 4) select Claude 3.5 via openrouter/anthropic/claude-3.5-sonnet.

The dev task was as follows. Functionality A/B/C needs implementong. Look at existing wrapper X implementing A/B/C, while using Y external library for A/B. Create new wrapper U, to use external library W, in the same way X is using Y, to do the similar A/B. (C is done in X and U respectivelly) E.g. - see how the data is passed X-to-Y, then do it the same way U-to-W. Look at examples code in the W library, figure how to do A/B.

This to avoid doing the reading abt W and figuring A/B myself. I can do it myself, have done it half a dozen times already, for U/W equivalents, but: bit boring, and wanted to find out if I can make AI do it for me.

Have yet to finish the full loop, the code does not run yet. But - before it was laughably obviously bad and wrong. Now - the 1st time where the code looks plausable. Need to do a harness to test finally. To be continued.

# Data Debugging

While reading Spinellis [https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/so/2024/04/10547621/1XvqtG0iCoE](https://www.computer.org/csdl/magazine/so/2024/04/10547621/1XvqtG0iCoE){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}, I was inspired and reminded to write down some data-debugging related practices so that I don\'t forget about them (may come handy in the future), and also may help someone else. If you have more - please share.

1.  Piping is useful for running things in parallel, especially with the multi-core machines we all use nowadays. Pipes provide the simplest dependency graph, and they have automatic IPC synchronization courtesy of the pipes FIFO-s flowing from one process to the next. That allows for individual processes in the pipeline to be run independently on different cores with the data flowing between allowing them to keep busy and not stall waiting.

2.  Drawback of data flowing through the pipelines is that data flow is invisible to us and no record remains of the data available for inspection and debugging. Replacing a pipe \"\|\" with \"\| tee tempfile \|\" allows for subsequent inspection of the \"tempfile\" to see what the data looked like.

    Example - debug:

    \

          $ for a in {1..10}; do echo $a; done | wc -l

    as

    \

          $ for a in {1..10}; do echo $a; done | tee tempfile | wc -l
          $ cat tempfile

3.  Vectorised processing via numpy or in languages like matlab or array languages where the default data type is not a scalar (but an array or Ndim array in general) makes peeking into the individual values being aggregated or processed hard and needing extra effort.

    a.  Use hardware support for NaN to your advantage to prevent accidentally using missing data. Convert missing data on input into NaN in memory where possible (data is float or double). Any operation with a NaN will result in a NaN, so it will be detected in the end. In contrast, stand in values for missing data like 0 can be used undetected.
    b.  If possible structure processing in the form of apply(function,array) so to use a kernel function that data will flow through. Then insert logging inside it to inspect data flowing through, turn it on/off where insight/speed is needed.

4.  Use any data invariants to your advantage. Add asserts liberally to catch data breaking invariants as early as possible. If possible designate not-a-value for other types (analogous to NaN for floats) where possible, even if the hardware support is lacking: 0 for indices (assuming 1-based), INT_MIN as INT_NAN for integers, nullprt for pointers.

5.  This book has been useful to me for coding, but lessons apply to data too - \"Writing Solid Code\" by Steve Maguire.

6.  Data is used to run experiments, and experiments *must* be reproducible (b/c - science!). So:

    a.  Any external data source used (and thus outside our control) must be cached.
    b.  It must be possible to run the whole experiment without touching any external data source, only using cached data - so any run is reproducible.
    c.  Often it\'s possible to leverage binary native de/serialization capabilities with a bit of care and prologue/epilogue code blocks.

    Example - python:

    \

           name = cache_name()
           try:
               with open(name, 'rb') as f: st = pickle.load(f)
           except IOError:
               st = fetch_from_external_source()
               ... (maybe initial preprocessing, cleaning) ...
               with open(name, 'wb') as f: pickle.dump(st, f)

    Example - matlab:

    \

           name = cache_name();
           st = load_struct_from_mat(name);
           if isempty(st)
             st = fetch_from_external_source();
             ... (maybe initial preprocessing, cleaning) ...
             save_struct_to_mat(name, st);
           end

7.  Version data: where possible/space allowing, and often where the data is ASCII (e.g. .csv or .tsv files) - add it straight to a git repository.

8.  Version data: where not possible b/c too much space - version the binary blobs outside a repository using the filesystem.

9.  Keep ASCII files (.csv, .tsv) on disk compressed in a streaming-friendly format, not only to (a) save space, but also to ensure (b) integrity via checksuming, and possibly even to (c) speed up reading.

10. Use formats like .zstd and .gz that are append and rsync friendly, e.g. where if

    \

          $ zstd -c file1 >file.zst; zstd -c file2 >>file.zst, 

    then

    \

          $ diff <(zstd -dc file.zst) <(cat file{1,2}) 

    produces no diffs.

    Use \--rsyncable in gzip and zstd (NB bzip2 lacks that) to create rsync-friendly compressed files.

11. If keeping ASCII data compressed (e.g. .csv.zst) in git can enable comfortable diffing - in .gitattributes add:

    \

          *.csv.zst diff=csv.zst

    while in .gitconfig add:

    \

          [diff "csv.zst"]
          textconv = zstdcat

# Links to Blogs, Substacks, Youtubes, Podcasts, Magazines etc

Over the years online, I benefited immensely from the Internet users that write and put up stuff online for other users to read. For the love of it - nothing else. There is no purer form of creativity than that. \"Here!! I like this, maybe you will like it too. On an off chance, infinitesimally small, I make this extra step extra effort to put it out there on the Internet. Free, free like beer and freedom too, for all to see\".

Initially and for a long time things were kept and curated in Bookmarks. Then Google spoiled me when it became possible to \"Google it\" anything - there was no great need for Bookmarks. Then Internet expanded and some things are Social media posts, others are Substacks, still others are old style personal blogs, then there is Youtube podcasts and videos, then Spotify, then podcasts on other platforms etc etc. So I thought this is a good place - yet another place; but redundancy is the mother of resilience - to add links to content I liked and consume online. References and links put in no particular order, as my memory blurts them out. It\'s good to have them on one page and check from time to time.

Nowadays with every author being online, one gets to imbibe their ideas anyway on the 80/20 principle, via the \"quanta of ideas\" that are memes, spread esp via X/Twitter/Bsky where the medium specifically encourages that. So when I finally get to a book or a movie of the author, I already have heard or seen 80% of what they are saying, know of the ideas, so often I don\'t get to finish the book or the movie! I\'m not complaining though - but bragging about it! Because there is something else already worthy of attention! We are so so lucky now. Some of my memories of my childhood (in the 1980-s late socialism of Yugoslavia) are of mind bending boredom. There was little to do, life was very boring at times (not all the time - other times it was fun and exciting), that reading a mildly interesting book, watching an interesting movie on TV (1.5 channels) or in the cinema (not that many of those), or playing - or more often watching others play - random games in the local arcades tent, was a treat. Home computers changed that somewhat, and then Personal Computers and latter the online world and Internet changed that a lot! And for the better.

# Consciousness

## Q: What is your current working definition of consciousness?

Everything I\'ve heard from [Joscha Bach](http://bach.ai/) (JB) makes every sense to me. (and [Michael Levin](https://thoughtforms.life/)) I have not got much to contribute on top of that. So just enumerating things heard and remembered (even if not super-faithfully) here. To have a brief in one place.

The last thing that personally puzzled was: why is consciousness such a big deal? Yeah we have reasons to think \"there is something there\", and we can\'t \"pin it down\". But our world is filled with such wonders. Why is consciousness so special? IDK. Then recently heard JB on a podcast say \"Aristotle didn\'t think consciousness was a big deal.\" - and that made me feel better. (latter I heard Pinker say that Dennett thought it \"not a biggie\" too) Maybe I should take consciousness more seriously. But that would be like a non-believer that realises he\'d be better off, if he could make himself believe in a deity, when surrounded by theists. Now knowing I\'m not the only one thinking it\'s not that big a deal, and knowing of other - infinitely more illustrious - names, eases the discomfort.

Observables that must be true about consciousness (by JB). I agree with JB and this makes every sense to me:

1.  Lower level, maybe even lowest level, not \"the pinnacle\". E.g. baby that grows into a Nobel prize winner had consciousness before they became Nobel prize winners.
2.  Necessary for learning, bootstraps knowledge acquisition. Entities lacking consciousness can\'t learn, don\'t learn. Unfortunate kids with brain damage lacking consciousness never learn much, stay almost plants. Zombies in movies lose consciousness at the point of zombification. Their knowledge is frozen to that point, they learn nothing new from that point onwards.
3.  Has element of self reflection. We know that we know.\
    This looks less solid than 1-2 above to me. It maybe we are just telling a story, simply doing what brains ordinarily do (construct models on the fly), just on a specific questions about the brain, when turning the brain instrument unto explaining itself, it creates a model. Completely like every other model the mind constructs, nothing special. Like LLM chain of reasoning: asking for self-reflection \"why did you output this\" - it simply comes back with another plausible story, completely unrelated to its inner workings. That the object being modelled is the brain itself, makes zero difference. It\'s like chip design software, running on x86 itself, designing an x86 chip, versus designing an ARM chip. Running on x86 designing x86, does as good a job as, running on x86 designing an ARM chip. No reason to suspect the software running on x86 will do a better job designing x86 compared to designing ARM.

Putting 1 + 2 + 3 together, I\'m guessing, consciousness is:

4.  Feature of ours and animals brains architectures that implements constraints important for learning quickly in the real world. Something that constrains the weight space, so we learn before we become food for others. It must be evolutionary selected if it appears in every living thing. Must confer some advantage. Learning quicker that the competition is an advantage.
5.  Constraints act on the internal representation, on the weights of the brains networks. A small controller module, that affects the network weights of the rest of the network. It\'s action is to constrain the other weights in some way, reduce the space of values the rest of the network weights can take. Like enforce consistency, some kind of averaging in time.
6.  Maybe enforcing something meta- about the weights, like regularisation - \"prefer smaller weights\", or maybe sparsity - \"prefer fewer non-zero weights\". (yeah regularisation and sparseness are in tension with each other) These maybe means-to-an end: ways to end up with the trillion dimensional weight space avoid some pathological cases.
7.  Or maybe it\'s one-off, developmental, like choosing architecture, layers (what neurons never connect). So once the brain develops almost fully past childhood + teenagehood, it becomes less relevant.
8.  The puzzle that biology HI use less data than AI, is more data efficient - maybe consciousness is a factor there? If knowledge is represented as acquired (joint) probability function, just placing a bump quickly in it at the (leaves rustling,tiger)-point rather than waiting for it to occur 10 times offers survival advantage.\
    To my mind everything that can be known about the relationship between X and Y is expressed by their joint p.d.f. \\( f\_{X,Y}(x,y) \\). Knowing that function [**is knowing**](post-knowing.html). Intelligence is querying it with an \\( X \\) observation \\( x = a \\), and coming back with knowledge about the goal \\( Y \\) from the conditional \\( f\_{Y\|X}(y\|x=a) \\) that has better error profile than the unconditional marginal \\( f_Y(y) \\). (both conditional and marginal functions are derivable from the joint) \"Better profile\" is minimizing future expected surprisal. (\"expected\" there implies knowledge, the joint pdf; only having knowledge gives rise to expectation.) \"Surprisal\" is the residual part we fail to forecast.\
    Aside: Chain-of-Reasoning is when we come up with R, which is not observed but created as an idea in our mind. R can be a possible factual like X (possible in the world). But also R can be a counter-factual, impossible to appear as observation X. Either way, this has to be such R, that P(Y\|R,X) brings us closer to a \"good\" Y than P(Y\|X) does. (NB from the joint we also have P(R\|X) at our disposal too.) These CoR discrete jumps via R, (possibly across local saddle points?) aiding searches via R, can\'t be steps too far. They have to be close (\~20%?) to the current state, for us not to get lost. (if too far the chance of being of use drops a lot; like stepping over stones crossing a river)

## Q: How would you test for machine consciousness?

General: pursue it assuming very low SNR to any evidence brought in. Via commonality - wherever I observe some consciousness effect 1-3 above, I then seek evidence to support finding 4-8 above. Via contrasting - wherever I observe consciousness effect 1-3 above, where I found 4-8 above, now I look to remove 4-8, and see if the effect 1-3 disappears. So compare and contrast both. Need to gather both positive pro- and negative anti- evidence, as in the case of consciousness, both the Q-uestion, and the A-nswer, are unknown. There are too many moving parts for much comfort. Maybe that\'s the \"hard problem\" referenced??

Concrete steps:

9.  Given it\'s shared by all living brains, assume it\'s shared by all AI brains. Take a bunch of LLM-s. Then look - along the lines of the work of [Evelina Fedorenko](https://www.evlab.mit.edu/) seeking commonality in common language space - look find common things between them, that can be fit in the 1-3 observations above.
10. Look at work of the likes like [Chris Olah](https://colah.github.io), try divine features that are structural. And than look again for that commonality in all of them, with an eye to 1-3.
11. Assuming all current LLM-s are conscious to non-zero degree, would think of ways how to zombify them. Whatever I think I found in {9,10} above, try to destroy undo that. Do the networks become less conscious now? In terms of 4-8?

## Addendum on the consciousness experiments designs. (aug2025)

(even if I think it a nothing burger as learned from your Bach Re: Aristotle, Dennett)

Look at known but still unresolved why/how-s differences between analogue HI (all life really, and at all levels of org hierarchy) and digital AI-s:

12. Perpetual learning without end. Digital/AI systems collapse. (so we stop training before) Whereas analogue/HI systems (all live systems in general) don\'t crash and burn, learning without end doesn\'t undermine them. (except in psychiatric/mind illnesses maybe?)
13. Truly online learning. Analogue/HI has no batches, no memory except for Now, no buffers no replays, (except maybe memory consolidation while at sleep states?) is at permanent epoch 1. Whereas digital/HI have mini-batches so we need buffers, and epochs \>1 so we need \"true\" (computer) memory. That learning regime is not even that well justified by the maths of it. (more like \"motivated\" by somewhat hand-wavy control theories)
14. Counter arguments to 12 and or 13 above, why not do them. Maybe the above 12/13 are not connected strictly to consciousness, but connected to: HI is good with many more parameters than observations, while (current) AI is good with many more observations than parameters. (but this can be folded in the experiments to test too?)

## Addendum after listening to the Tegmark ToE interview. (sep2025)

I liked everything [Max Tegmark](https://x.com/tegmark) said on that. And especially liked him say \"enough with the aww-shucks what impenetrable mystery could-be-this could-be-that impossible for us mere mortals to tell; let\'s design experiments, and measure, and yes it\'s not easiest to measure but not impossible too - physicists measure far more nuanced things all the time, and lets start ruling out some guesses.\"

\"How Physics Absorbed Artificial Intelligence & (Soon) Consciousness\" <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-gekVfUAS7c>, [Theories of Everything](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZ7ikzmc6zlN6E8KrxcYCWQIHg2tfkqvR) with [Curt Jaimungal](https://curtjaimungal.substack.com), Sep-2025

Consciousness view: it is like the conductor in the orchestra. It is the router in an Mixture of Experts model. Consciousness module is the router in MoE. Experts in the MoE are the individual members of the orchestra, every one playing their own instrument. So while the router is not a very big or a very special module (in fact - it\'s in many ways simpler then the specialised modules) - it\'s **a single point of failure**. So once consciousness (in HI brain) / router (in IA MoE) fails - no expert can learn properly, or even if the experts learns, the knowledge can not be utilised.

MoE architecture is the reason why it\'s so data efficient. Sparse representations, by virtue of injecting that prior knowledge in the process (\"these connections for this data do not need updating\"), can be data efficient. It\'s efficient to know in advance \"this data is no use to Experts 1,3,4,5, and is to be used to reach only Expert#2\". MoE is a reason why we have too many neurons. Our brains are less efficient than NN-s when it comes to utilising their weight. NN-s are much more efficient than us humans, when looking at efficiency in weights sizes space. Our brains trade parsimony in weights space, to gain efficiencies to gain speed and reduce power consumption - both achieved by MoE.

Sparse representatios (and MoE is a macro-scale example) may make incremental learning, which is one way to implement continuous learning, practically doable. If only a limited set of weight need to be updated, for the brain to acquire new memory or knowledge, that means it can be done without losing all other previous memory or knowledge.

\<p\>At this point maybe one needs to distinguish that consciousness may refer to (a) the basic algorithm that drives the process of self-organisation (b) the result of that process, the state of the brain once it goes 0-\>1 and becomes conscious. Either way it\'s like SGD learning and Type 1 learning aka \"pattern recognigtion\" (1 signal on input-\>1 response on output and 1 reward) in that it is concerned with (c) very short time horizons, and enables the most basic of (d) survival functionality; and (e) further learning like RL learning (sequence of signals on input-\>sequence of responses on output but only 1 reward at the end).\</p\>

Mixture-of-Experts MoE in addition to dense model variants please! It\'s so so much faster in terms for tokens per second on localhost.\
The number of active parameters makes a huge difference on a laptop. M2 mbp runs Gemma-3-27b and comparable dense Qwen3-32B at \~4-6 tps. But MoE Qwen3-30B-A3B runs at \~20-40 tps (!!) (esp when 0.6B speculative decode works well). And that makes for a world of difference in the user experience.\
More context 256K maybe even 512K would be very useful too.\
Do keep the QAT training please - that was just excellent! Hope all other OS models switch to QAT too.\

Jul 04 - Sep 07

G-Research (part of the DPFM group), London, UK
Position: Quantitative Analyst.
Research (70%), development (20%), daily portfolio monitoring and support (10%) in a
multi-billion market neutral hedge fund systematically trading global equities and spot
FX round the clock in a completely automated system. Research and creation of new
trading models/alphas, coding, testing in simulation and putting them in production.
Models for volume prediction, fundamentals and technical equities models (multiple
markets,), spot FX - all productionised and live traded. Built futures models but not
traded live. Development included coding up the models, the associated data analytics,
and subsequent performance and integrity monitoring once live. The portfolio support
role involved monitoring the trade flow, market conditions and risk factors,
investigating/tuning the trading. In the process familiarised myself with forecasting and
modelling, performance attribution, multiperiod quadratic portfolio optimisation, risk
measurement and management (Barra, APT, custom factors), real-time and historic data
feeds, data aggregation. Independently came up with original alphas building on well

Position: Quantitative Researcher.
On the TOPS QR team, senior team member among a handful of people, creating
research, developing code, shepherding the market neutral portfolio growth from a few
hundred millions to double digit billions USD gross book size. Ushered the idea of a
single unified framework for all quant R & D & trading with standardised components data ingestion and caching, signals extraction, modeller for forecasting, portfolio
optimizer, trades simulator, standardised reporting, a baseline sim faithful and realistic
to be continuously improved on by the entire team working in unison on various
components of the system. Wrote or significantly contributed to major components of
the system through their iterative improvements over the years. Big projects in
production improving the then best baseline: dynamic modeller fitting the alpha signals
expected returns at multiple horizons, incorporating both prior knowledge, constraints,
and the evidence from historical data, market impact model in the simulator and the
optimizer including slippage monitoring tuning and balancing risk cost of
undercharging with the opportunity cost of overcharging, liquid concentrated low TO
high capacity market neutral portfolios, 150/50 portfolios mix of tracker and market

Nov 07 - Nov 09

Credit Suisse, London, UK
Position: Quantitative Analyst.
On the Index Arbitrage proprietary trading desk. Independently traded equity
market/sector/factor neutral portfolios on multiple European markets, fully automated
and systematic, non-discretionary. Wrote own trading, analytics, backtest and portfolio
construction systematic trading platform consisting of a Matlab core, Mosek optimiser,
bash/awk scripts, Reuters Kobra Excel and Sql for historic and current data, with
integrated risk monitoring and control using Barra’s style factors and sectors. Used the
platform to research and trade all the strategies and portfolios. Alone did orders
generation, portfolio construction, forecasting & modelling, all data feeds (Reuters, Sql
dumps), the daily monitoring, trading analysis and slippage tracking and any other
R&D&ops as needed for trading. Traded multiple portfolios daily of ~500 names in
total on London, Paris, Frankfurt, Switzerland, Milan and Madrid exchanges, one trade
per day per name. Did R&D simulations for intra-day horizons faster TO.
In 2008 traded the London portfolio most of the year as a test bed for all research &
development, returning 10% gross in 230 days with Sharpe of 2.5. In 2009 traded
bigger book on most of the European markets, returned 8% gross to Aug’09 with
Sharpe of 5.2, turnover 2-3 days, one trade per name per day. All together lifetime (388
days) return on gross 18% at Sharpe of 3.1.

Jul 04 - Sep 07

G-Research (part of the DPFM group), London, UK
Position: Quantitative Analyst.
Research (70%), development (20%), daily portfolio monitoring and support (10%) in a
multi-billion market neutral hedge fund systematically trading global equities and spot
FX round the clock in a completely automated system. Research and creation of new
trading models/alphas, coding, testing in simulation and putting them in production.
Models for volume prediction, fundamentals and technical equities models (multiple
markets,), spot FX - all productionised and live traded. Built futures models but not
traded live. Development included coding up the models, the associated data analytics,
and subsequent performance and integrity monitoring once live. The portfolio support
role involved monitoring the trade flow, market conditions and risk factors,
investigating/tuning the trading. In the process familiarised myself with forecasting and
modelling, performance attribution, multiperiod quadratic portfolio optimisation, risk
measurement and management (Barra, APT, custom factors), real-time and historic data
feeds, data aggregation. Independently came up with original alphas building on well
known semi-parametric models for forecasting that were traded live in equities and spot
FX trading. Similarly contributed alphas based on novel non-parametric models used
for trading equities. They were all profitable, contributed to the bottom line and were
traded along the other alphas.

Abstract
Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems have made dramatic performance leaps in the
recent past. Yet, the notion that the key to making recognition more robust is to reduce the
difference between training and test conditions is still commonly held. As ASR applications move
from tightly controlled to more natural environments with a varying number of unpredictable
sound sources, this assumption is becoming less and less viable. Decoding the speech source of
interest while listening to several sound sources at the same time seems a more accurate description
of the ASR process that suits these challenging environments. This thesis discusses the theoretical
and practical issues which arise from this viewpoint. The aim is to explore the division of the
problem of robust ASR into two subproblems: (a) identification/separation of the speech and
noise using speech properties alone; and (b) recognition based on the resulting partial evidence.
The basic assumption is that some regions of the speech time-frequency representation remain
relatively unaffected by the noise, that they can be identified and that they alone are sufficient for
ASR. In contrast to conventional techniques which require models of all sources in the auditory
scene and their subsequent decoding even when only one of the sources is of interest, the techniques
described in this thesis make no such requirement. However, they are flexible enough to use this
information if it is available.
Two techniques are used to adapt a conventional Hidden Markov model (HMM) based ASR
system to use partial evidence: (i) marginalisation of the state distributions, so that only the
likelihood of the reliable regions is assessed; and (ii) imputation of the unreliable regions by
replacing the unreliable features with a single point from the state conditional distributions. In
both cases, the ”counterevidence” - assessing which states are unlikely to have generated the
speech underlying the unreliable regions dominated by noise - further constrains the decoding. The
techniques are evaluated on the Aurora 2 connected digit recognition task, and seem to perform
competitively. In the experiments, the reliable features are identified via local SNR estimates
derived through stationary and adaptive on-line noise estimates. The potential of the techniques
is indicated by using the clean speech to identify the reliable regions in the noisy speech, where
the accuracy is maintained even at -5 dB. The simple all-or-nothing assumption (the feature is
either reliable or unreliable) gives rise to a model linking the recognition and the separation as
two interdependent sides of the search for the most likely explanation of the noisy data.

Acknowledgements
First I would like to thank by supervisor Phil Green who has made this work possible. His
direct support through balanced encouragement, suggestions, criticism and freedom, as well as the
indirect support as head of the Speech and Hearing Group (SPandH) in Sheffield which turned
out such a terrific place to work and be during the course of my studies, has been invaluable.
I thank my adviser Martin Cooke who has been a source of inspiration throughout the PhD
and an early pioneer of many of the ideas explored here. He also provided the most of the software
for the early set of experiments.
I have benefited greatly from the interaction with other members of the Speech and Hearing
Group in Sheffield. Without trying to mention each one individually, I just wish to thank Miguel
Carreira-Perpiñán for lending himself available for long discussions, and Jon Barker for putting
together the CASA toolkit (CTK), used in the latter set of experiments.
David Pearce from the Motorola UK Laboratories in Basingstoke has been a patient listener and
supporter of our ideas, and I thank him for making possible a productive eight months internship
in Basingstoke.
The work reported here would have been impossible without the support from Motorola and
the University of Sheffield. The work was also supported by the Chevening scholarship of the
British Council, provided by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, and a PhD scholarship from
the Ministry of Science of Republic of Macedonia.
Finally, I wish to thank my family. Thank you Petrula for the courage, patience and the
unconditional support. Thank you Kalen and Vedar for bringing me such a joy and fun. Thank
you mum and dad for the unwavering support in difficult circumstances.

Introduction
1.1

Motivation

Current Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems perform acceptably in controlled environments (Baker et al., 1991; Kubala et al., 1991; Murveit et al., 1991). The performance is good
enough to be deployed in commercial products. However, when used in “noisy conditions”, their
performance deteriorates rapidly to a point where they are unusable in practise (Agaiby et al.,
1997). We refer to this as a problem of robustness of the ASR systems. Compared to the human
performance in less then ideal conditions, ASR systems perform an order of magnitude worse,
even when specially adapted to cope with that particular kind of degradation, as illustrated by
Table 1.1 which summarises a recent comparison on various corpora and types of speech (Allen,
2002; Lippmann, 1996). Current systems seem usable on speech which is generated for machine
recognition, rather than for listeners. Applications like recognition of spontaneous speech in spoken dialogue systems (especially over the phone), recording legal proceedings, taking minutes of
meetings or recognition/transcription of broadcast news (Pallet et al., 1998) are still too hard.
The performance figures cited in the literature vary from 2% word error rate (WER) for airplane
travel system with medium vocabulary to 50% WER for large vocabulary dialog system (Comerford et al., 1997). Human WER on similar spontaneous speech is around 4%. It seems that the
problem of robustness is one of the important obstacles on the way to wider deployment of speech
enabled products (Sagayama and Kiyoami, 1997). In this thesis, we will use the term “robustness”
to mean “robustness to added noise” or, more generally, “robustness to the presence of other sound
sources”.

1.2

Objectives of the thesis

It is well documented that humans can cope with unnatural and unseen degradations, seemingly
without prior training or adaptation. They can ignore broad range of degradations and deletions
in time and frequency domain, while still taking into account whatever information or cues are left
for the recognition. Humans seem capable of utilising the partial information left in the degraded
speech (Allen, 1994). This is exactly the capability that “missing data” approach researched in
this work tries to utilise for improved accuracy of an realistic automatic speech recognition (ASR)
system in less–then–ideal conditions. The main aim of the work reported here is to investigate
whether a realistic system, working with realistic speech corpora and in realistic noisy conditions1 is
feasible, and whether it seems possible to deliver performance improvements now or in a foreseeable
future. Other aims of the thesis include reviewing and consolidating previous work that might be
of interest, looking for a realistic candidate techniques than could be used for speech identification,
investigating the variants of the techniques for adapting the ASR system to handle partial speech,
identifying the root causes for performance degradation in noisy conditions.

1.3

Contributions

Missing data ASR extends/adapts the monosource ASR model dominant today to a multisource
auditory scene. The extension is “economical” in a sense that not all sources need to be decoded if
only one is of interest. The idea has been applied to a full–blown ASR system for connected digit
recognition, together with techniques for actual separation of the sound sources (however primitive
they are). The main contribution of the thesis is that the complete missing data (MD) ASR chain
has been tested with realistic noises, expected to be encountered in a typical application. Several
techniques, like Token Dependent Noise Estimation (Section 6.4.6) and adaptive local SNR estimation (Section 6.4.2), have been developed during the course of the experiments for the purpose
of obtaining a mask estimate. The SNR based separation has been tested completing the MD
ASR chain in full. A new technique named bounded state based data imputation (Section 5.5.5,
also pp. 86) has been developed that can be used not only to recognise, but also to reconstruct the
full speech spectrum out of the partial speech. The probability of the mask estimate has also been
integrated in the MD ASR system (Sections 5.3, 5.4.1) leading to improvements in the accuracy.
The missing data (MD) model separates the problem of robust ASR into two distinct parts:
speech–noise separation/identification and speech modelling. This allows for use of “simulated
data”, so it is possible to judge which of those two underperforms in noisy conditions. The work
present here points to poor speech identification, rather then poor speech modelling, as the root
cause of performance degradation.
All the work reported here has been done in collaboration with other members of the Speech
and Hearing Group (SPandH) in the Department of Computer Science at the Sheffield University,
UK, during the course of several years. Appendix E attempts to acknowledge the contributions of
the people involved in the work reported here. Any missattributions and/or lack of are solely my
fault, and I would gladly correct the errors if/when notified.

Overview of the thesis

The thesis consists of seven chapters and several appendices.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION

Chapter 2 is a review of the other approaches to the problem of robustness in ASR taken so
far. The chapter follows a fairly standard taxonomy of techniques arising from the view that lack
of robustness is due to a mismatch between the conditions during training and testing of the ASR
system.
In chapter 3 the original motivations and the structure of a ASR system operating under
assumptions that the data is missing are lied down. It also reviews the previous MD work.
Chapter 4 discusses the problem of sound sources separation from the mixture. Section 4.2
shows how computational auditory scene analysis (CASA) may be used to tackle this problem.
Section 4.4 outlines some of the techniques for local Signal–to–Noise Ratio (SNR) estimation that
can be used as an (computationally cheap) alternative to CASA methods. Section 4.3 discusses
the model used for general (not only for speech) blind source separation and its relation to MD.
Chapter 5 lays down the techniques used to implement the ideas underlying our current understanding of the MD process in a context of a standard HMMs–based recogniser. It introduces
a model for MD ASR treating the mask as a random variable.
In the subsequent Chapter 6 the results of the experiments where a MD ASR system is applied
to “standard” tests in robust ASR are discussed. Connected digits are the corpus of choice, and
experiments are carried out using both some of the NOISEX noises and the Aurora 2 noisy digits
databases.
The last chapter, Chapter 7, is a discussion about the relationship between the MD techniques
and some of the “more established” as well as “emerging” techniques for improving the robustness
of the ASR systems. It also attempts to answer some commonly asked questions about MD ASR,
speculates about a possibility of a system that fully integrates the recognition and the separation
parts of the system and draws the main conclusions from this work.

Review of techniques for robust
automatic speech recognition
2.1

Introduction

Todays ASR systems perform well enough to be deployed wide range of applications. However,
moving the applications from tightly controlled to real world environments remains a challenge.
The migration exposes problems rooted in our ignorance about how to model the sources of
speech variability in changing acoustic environment, previously masked by the assumption of a
quiet environment and single source auditory scene.
The aim of this chapter is to present and discuss various approaches that have been used to
increase the robustness of the ASR systems. It briefly introduces some of the factors contributing
to the speech variability first. It then moves on to concentrate on the variability due to noise.
Subsequently, it introduces the notion of an acoustic environment to describe the interaction
between the speech and the noise. Next it proceeds with classification of the techniques for
improving the ASR systems robustness into three large groups. Number of techniques from each
group are introduced in the following text. At places the division seems a bit artificial – but
this is a common problem facing any attempt to bring under a common umbrella techniques that
have evolved mainly independently and over some period of time. However, it is evident that the
classification is coherent with the architecture of the todays prevalent statistical ASR systems.
Towards the end of the chapter combinations of techniques as applied in real world tasks are
discussed. The chapter concludes with a summary of the techniques. Appendix A summarises
the performance of the techniques published in the reviewed literature. However, the value of the
summary in assessing the relative merits of the techniques is limited. Until very recently, there was
no de facto standard task (and corpus) to assess the techniques for robust ASR. The researchers
have been using vastly different systems and speech corpora, leading to inability to compare the
techniques across different research groups.

2.2

Origins of speech variability

Some common reasons for variability in speech are:
• contamination with noise (additive, convolutional, reverberation);
• speaking style (Lombard effect, speaking rate);
• inter speaker variations (voice quality, pitch, gender, dialect);
• task/context (dialogue, dictation, conversation).

CHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR

Kajarekar et al. (1999)’s study on the origins of the speech variability found that the phone (with
influence spreading beyond phoneme boundaries), the context and the speaker contribute most to
the variability and are interdependent. A principal component analysis (PCA) of the sources of
variability of the models trained on speaker–dependent speech pointed to the gender difference as
the most significant factor (Kuhn et al., 1998).
Noise
Additive noise usually results from a microphone picking other sound sources in addition to the
speech that is to be recognised. These are sounds generated by the office equipment, coming from
the traffic on the street, etc. The human auditory system is so robust to this degradation that
humans aren’t aware of it most of the time. Additive noise is additive to the speech signal in the
time domain and in the complex spectral domain. It can be also assumed additive on average
in the power spectral domain. The noise can be stationary (constant) or changing with time
(non–stationary). The short burst of noise are known as impulsive noise.
Convolutional noise or linear filtering refers to the way speech changes on its path from the
source (mouth) until it is converted in digital form. The reasons are numerous – from interaction
with the walls of the room to the imperfect transduction by the microphone, telephone, etc.
Convolutional noise is multiplicative to the speech signal in frequency domain, hence the term
linear filtering.
In a typical environment, a microphone mounted on a table in front of a speaker picks up
not only the actual speech, but copies of the speech that bounced off the walls and arrived at
the microphone with some latency and distorted. This is known as reverberation. So, the signal
observed through the microphone is a sum of the original speech (coming through the direct path)
and several delayed copies (although their amplitude diminishes quickly) of this speech convolved
(linearly filtered) with the rooms impulse response. These secondary, tertiary... (and further)
copies of the speech can not be simply considered as noise. The noise is assumed independent
(and thus uncorrelated) with the speech, and exactly the opposite is true in the reverberation
condition–the additive components coming from the reflections are obviously strongly dependent
on the original speech. Usually algorithms based on multiple observations (arrays of microphones)
are used to handle this type of degradation, but the results are far from perfect. This is one of
the reasons why in most applications, users of the todays speech technology products use close–
talking microphones. Humans seem to have a robust mechanism for suppression of the copies of
the signals arriving up to 40ms after the initial signal, if they are not significantly louder (the
precedence effect).
Other factors
The Lombard effect (Junqua, 1993; Junqua et al., 1998) refers to a change in the speaking style
when the speaker is in a noisy environment. The speaker articulates her/his speech in such a
way that it is more noise–robust for human perception. Therefore, this affects all information
extracted from the speech signal (speech features) used by the present ASR systems at a great
extent, hindering its performance. It is not simply the case of speaking loudly and/or slowly.
Making more vocal effort changes articulation style in a complex way. The Lombard effect also
makes data–gathering for robust ASR difficult: speech produced in a truly noisy environment will
be different from speech produced in quiet, with noise added on later.
The speaking rates of the speakers can vary significantly too. It changes not only in response
to the acoustic environment, but also because of a number of other factors.
The voice quality, gender, age, dialect are another source of variation in the speech that ASR
systems have to take into account. Todays systems are usually trained on a large collection of
speakers, making them speaker independent (SI). During the enrolment phase (if there is one),
or using few initial sentences of the dialogues (when there isn’t an enrolment phase), the system
derives the speaker dependent (SD) models from the SI models by some form of adaptation of
the SI models. However, for most of the present systems there usually exists a small category of

CHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR

speakers for whom (due to different factors) the system exhibits exceptionally high WER – the so
called “sheep & goats” phenomenon. This is another issue that hinders speech enabled products
and solutions.
Trying to apply ASR systems trained on read speech to the task of ASR of spontaneous speech
speech researchers have found that there is a big difference in the articulation of the speech, the
pronunciation and the vocabulary of the speaker when (s)he has a task to accomplish (various
dialogue systems with some aim like information retrieval, tickets reservation, etc). Continuous
read speech (e.g. dictation), speech in a dialogue and conversational speech all make difference
for the present recognisers. Therefore, the recogniser has to be tailored to the specific task.
The following work is mainly concerned with the variability due to additional noise. This can
be considered as robustness in the stricter sense. The term “additional noise” refers to any sound
in the auditory scene that is not the speech the systems attends and tries to recognise. It can be
speech, as well. Techniques for handling convolutional noise will be reviewed as well, since it is
also commonly encountered noise.

2.3

“Mismatch between the training and testing conditions”
view to the problem of robustness

The “mainstream view” on the problem of robustness in ASR today is that performance degradation in ASR systems is due to the difference between the statistical properties of the speech
they receive at their input when employed in a real-life application, and the speech used for training (estimation) of the parameters of their statistical models during system construction (Gong,
1995; Furui, 1997). This is commonly referred to as a “mismatch between training and testing
conditions” view of the problem. Usually, the training conditions are: clean speech (although this
need not be always the case) and speech gathered from different speakers, with different genders,
speaking rates, dialects etc. (Paul and Baker, 1992; Muthasamy et al., 1992; Phillips et al., 1992;
Cole et al., 1992).
Training the recogniser in matched noisy conditions
The “mismatch” description of the problem implies its solution: collecting training data in the
same conditions as the testing data (“the same” in a statistical sense, that is, drawn from the
same source/distribution). Therefore, no mismatch is going to occur and the ASR system is
both designed and trained and used on the same type of speech. However, many factors influence
variability in the real world. They are also interdependent. It is costly and difficult to put together
enormous amounts of data to reflect all possible combinations of sources of mismatch.
A larger problem is that it is not certain that this approach can deliver the performance needed
for applications in noise. There is a possibility that deriving models from such heterogeneous data
may lead to flat models with poor discrimination performing badly in every particular, concrete
condition (Lee, 1997). Recently, recognisers trained in a “multiconditional regime” on speech
with added noise (four realistic noise types) at several SNRs (clean, 20dB, 15dB, 10dB, 5dB)
featured average word error (WER) increase from 1.48% on clean speech to 38.29% on speech
contaminated with noise at 0dB global SNR (Hirsch and Pearce, 2000). The task was connected
digits recognition.1 Even with a reasonable match between the training and the testing data,
the performance remains unacceptable for application. Further, the recogniser doesn’t show any
further degradation in performance when tested on a data contaminated with four other (then
the ones used for training) types of noise. This weakens the claim that the solution is to match
the training and the testing conditions exactly. The existing techniques for noise suppression
and robust ASR manage to decrease the WER significantly (Hariharan et al., 2000). But this
1 Informal trials with small number of subjects on the same corpus indicate that the performance of human
listeners just about starts to deteriorate at 0 dB SNR

CHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR

7

particular task is fairly simple and it is difficult to say whether the widely practised techniques
will scale up to a more difficult one.
Adaptive ASR
Another way to reduce the mismatch between the training and testing conditions is to make the
recogniser adaptable. Ideally, the recogniser would be aware of the conditions it operates in.
Upon detecting an particular acoustic condition, it should adapt correspondingly. This approach
relies on (explicit or implicit) prior knowledge about the nature of the noise and how it differs
from the speech it is mixed with. The usual assumptions are that the speech and the noise are
independent and thus uncorrelated, and that the noise varies slowly. Unfortunately, many common
environments feature reverberation and impulsive noises which fall out of this category.
Most of the recognisers today use a combination of both matched training and adaptation to
improve the robustness. The training data taken represents as much of the variability as possible
without sacrificing too much performance. During recognition, various adaptation techniques,
that are both knowledge based (assuming some noise characteristics and how it combines with
the speech in the mixture) and data driven (using speech data from the particular environment
in which the recognition occurs) are usually deployed in the recogniser.

2.4

Modelling the acoustic environment

Speech models trained on clean speech are sufficient for ASR of clean speech, without additive
or convolutional noise. However, in noisy conditions, the observations are result of a complex
acoustic environment, with the speech source being only a part in it. The other two components
are:
• the noise source(s)
• the way speech signal combines with the noise signal(s) to form the observations that are
fed into the recogniser
The knowledge of the above factors, in addition to the knowledge of the speech, completely describes the auditory scene for the purposes of ASR.
Additive acoustic model
For example, if speech and noise are additive in some domain x = s + n, then the p.d.f. of the
noisy speech is the convolution of the p.d.f.s of the speech and the noise:
Z
pX (x) = pS (u)pN (x − u)du
(2.1)
Even techniques that don’t assume explicitly the nature of the two factors above, implicitly use
some knowledge about them. So they too can be accounted for in this view of the noisy environment.
Confining the modelling to speech mixed with convolutional and additive noise only, the observed noisy speech z can be expressed as a function of the speech s, the convolutional noise h
and the additive noise n (⊗ denotes the convolution operator):
x(t) = s(t) ⊗ h(t) + n(t)

(2.2)

This model (in various guises2 ) has been used extensively by most of the researchers in the robust
ASR in the past (Acero, 1990; Gales, 1995; Moreno, 1996; Stern et al., 1996). The power spectrum
of the observed signal is:
|X(w)|2 = |S(w)H(w)|2 + |N (w)|2 + 2|S(w)H(w)||N (w)| cos(θ)
2 Matrouf and Gauvain (1997) use the equivalent x(t) = h(t) ⊗ (s(t) + n(t))

(2.3)

CHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR

where θ is the angle between the speech and the noise vectors. Assuming no prior knowledge about
the θ (i.e. it is uniformly distributed in [0, 2π]), the expected value of the noisy power spectrum
is:
Z 2π
1
2
E{|X(w)| } =
|S(w)H(w)|2 + |N (w)|2 + 2|S(w)H(w)||N (w)| cos(θ)dθ
2π 0
= |S(w)H(w)|2 + |N (w)|2
(2.4)
Hence the frequent assumption that with enough smoothing the speech and noise power spectrums
add up to the power spectrum of the noisy speech.
Often, additional assumptions are introduced in the environmental model:
• the additive noise n is independent of the speech s
• the convolutive noise h is constant over time and independent of the speech s
The first one is almost universally true. It is necessary for derivation of the p.d.f. of the noisy
observations out of the speech and noisy p.d.f.s. The second assumption allows for the convolutive
noise to be modelled as an additive constant in the log–spectral domain. There are models for
speech and noise separation which do not make this assumption (Section 4.3). However, almost
all ASR systems assume at least slowly varying gain in the log-spectral domain.
MAX model
Another common model of how the speech and the noise combine (in the feature domain) to
produce the noisy speech features is the MAX model. It is applied on features in log–spectral (or
log–filterbank) domain. It has been observed that in this domain increasing noise leads to gradual
submergence of the less energetic speech features beneath the noisy ones (Figure 3.2). This can
be modelled as if the noisy speech (feature) is:
x = max{s, n}

(2.5)

The principal reason for this is the logarithmic–like compression exhibited by the human hearing,
and mimicked by the feature extraction process in all ASR systems. Assuming that the speech and
the noise are additive in time and power spectrum domains (e.g. previous section), the compression
of their sum can be approximated by a compression of the bigger of the two:
log(x) = log(s + n) ≈ log(max{s, n}) = max{log(s), log(n)}

(2.6)

Figure 2.1 depicts the MAX approximation, the correct value and the relative absolute error of
the approximation for a typical range of speech and noise filterbank features. The relative error is
greatest along the line s = n, but quickly decreases with the inverse of s (and n). In the extreme
case at (0, 0) the relative error reaches 100%. However, in real speech this rarely happens. Most
of the time either speech or noise features have values well above zero and the approximation is
useful. The effect of this environmental model on the p.d.f. of the noisy speech is discussed in
Section 3.5.1.

2.5

Techniques for robust ASR

The mismatch between the training and testing conditions because of additive and convolutional
noise can be reduced at several levels of the ASR system’s speech processing chain. Commonly
encountered approaches can be classified as (Gong, 1995):
• using inherently robust features
• speech signal “enhancement”

• speech model adaptation
Another view of the taxonomy of mismatch reduction is that the mismatch because of the noise
can be considered to happen, and can be reduced in:
• the feature space - either by “enhancing” the speech features so that the noisy speech features
are similar to the clean ones; or by robust feature extraction that gives similar features both
for clean and noisy speech
• the model space - change the model parameters so that the changes in the features due to
noise are compensated in the models (Furui, 1997).
Figure 2.2 depicts the techniques for robust ASR that are going to be reviewed in this chapter.
This classification mainly arises from the architecture of the present statistical ASR systems,
where the recognition happens in two independent stages.
In the first stage, the information content of the speech signal is reduced by some transformation
in such a way (intended) to preserve information considered to be “important” for the recognition,
and discard the rest of it. Most often this is the “gross shape” of the spectrum. The result of the
transformation is a feature vector.
In the second stage, a discrete state space is searched for the most probable path of quasi–
stationary articulatory configurations that might have resulted in the observed sequence. In the
speech recognition systems today this is commonly expressed as looking for a “word” W0 out of
dictionary of all “words” the recogniser can recognise with the property:3
W ∗ = argmaxP (W |O)

(2.7)

W

where O are the observed features extracted in the first stage. This can be rewritten as:

The first factor P (O|W ) is the acoustical model. It expresses the constraints about the way the
articulators could have moved to give rise to a particular sequence of feature vectors O in the
realization of the “word” W . The constraints are derived from hundreds of hours of speech during
the system training (construction). The second factor P (W ) is the language model. It expresses
the probability of the word W before any acoustic evidence is seen. It is usually derived from a
huge collection of written texts.
The recogniser can generate all possible hypothesis W , compute the probability of each one
given the evidence, and choose the most probable hypothesis W ∗ as an answer. For an isolated
words recogniser this is a simple task. In a connected words recognition task, the hypothesis space
may grow larger, but it can be searched efficiently and exhaustively with the Viterbi algorithm.
Further, only on a small vocabulary task the recogniser can use separate model for each word.
The large vocabulary tasks require modelling of the subword units (typically context sensitive
phone4 ), and stringing them together according to a pronunciation dictionary for the words in
the lexicon. Typically the hypothesis space grows too large for an exhaustive search. Various
hypothesis pruning techniques that remove the unlikely hypothesis from the search space early are
essential.

2.6

Speech enhancement

Techniques from this class aim to reduce the statistical difference between clean training and noisy
testing features using some apriori knowledge about the speech, the noise and/or the way they
combine. All systems today use some of the techniques from this class. Most of them originate
from attempts to improve speech intelligibility. They all introduce a new problem to the robust
ASR as well: the “enhanced” or “cleaned” (because they mostly deal with noise attenuation)
speech maybe more intelligible to the humans, but not to the ASR systems. The degradations
occurring due to “cleaning” are particularly harmful as they are non–linear, unnatural and their
extent is hard to quantify in advance. On the other side, the present statistical ASR systems
are quite sensitive to degradations producing data unseen during the training (the problem of
statistical “outliers”).
One way to limit the damage is to train the ASR system on “cleaned” clean speech so that the
statistical models train to handle the degradation. Another possibility is to modify the enhancement process in such a way to balance the enhancement and the degradation of the speech.
Speech enhancement is particularly attractive when other ASR system components can not be
changed.

2.6.1

Spectral subtraction

Spectral subtraction (SS) is the dominant technique today for cleaning the speech from the additive
noise. The prerequisite is that the average noise spectrum can be estimated. This is usually done
by detecting the most recent non–speech region and estimating the noise spectrum there. Various
noise–estimation methods are discussed in section 4.4. The underlying assumption is that the
noise will not change abruptly and will be close to its mean during this short period of time. The
assumed model of the environment is Eq. (2.2) with h(t) = 1:
x(t) = s(t) + n(t)

(2.9)

Spectral subtraction takes place in the spectral domain, after a short term windowed Fourier
transform is applied to the signals (Boll, 1979):
X(jw) = S(jw) + N (jw)
PL

(2.10)

where X(jw) = k=1 x(k)e−jwk . The magnitude of the estimated clean speech ŝ (the result of
SS) equals the magnitude of the noisy speech less the average noise magnitude, while the phase is
4 loosely defined as phoneme–like unit

CHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR

12

the same as the phase of the noisy speech:
Ŝ(jw) = [|X(jw)| − E{|N (jw)|}]ejθx (e

jw

)

(2.11)

The noise magnitude is averaged only across the sufficiently silent frames considered to be pure
noise because of absence of speech activity (gaps between the words, syllables, pauses, etc). Boll
(1979) proceeds further with:
• half wave–rectification of ŝ (setting the negative values to zero, while retaining the positive
ones)
• residual noise reduction by selecting the smallest magnitude value of the three adjacent
(across time) values in the same frequency bin where the current amplitude is smaller then
the maximal noise residual during the non–speech period
• additional noise suppression in the periods without speech in the resulting cleaned speech ŝ;
the period is classified as such if ŝ is lower then -12 dB
The original method was developed for speech enhancement, and after cleaning it proceeds further
with speech reconstruction (using the phase of the noisy speech).
Although the original SS operates in magnitude domain, to justify it in a statistical sense
it should be applied to the power spectral domain. As in Eq. (2.3), under the assumptions that
speech and noise are independent and that the short term averages of the noise and cleaned speech
describe their true values sufficiently well, the following holds (Kermorvant, 1999):
|Ŝ(jw)|2 = |X(jw)|2 − E{|N (jw)|2 }

(2.12)

The enhanced speech itself suffers from unnatural coloration known as “musical noise”, further
speech distortion and some of the noise that was not removed. An extension known as “non–linear
spectral subtraction” (NSS) introduces several parameters to balance these adverse effects (Berouti
et al., 1979; Lockwood and Boudy, 1991). NSS computes ŝ as:
D(w) =
|Ŝ(jw)|2

=

G[|X(jw)|2γ − αE{|N (w)|2γ }]
(
D1/γ ,
if D1/γ > βE{|N (jw)|2 }
βE{|N (jw)|2 } , otherwise

(2.13)

The parameters α, β (overestimation factor), γ (the power spectrum exponent) and the gain G
(normalisation gain introduced to compensate for the distortions caused by γ) are all hand tuned
on small databases to achieve satisfactory results. In the context of an ASR system, the clean
speech is itself “cleaned” with NSS to achieve further robustness to the distortions caused by the
cleaning.
The NSS was further extended to include an estimate of the noise variance (in addition to the
mean) and to operate in the log–spectral domain which is more suited to an ASR system (Xie and
Campernolle, 1993). The minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimator of the cleaned speech
given the noisy speech uses the assumed probability density functions (p.d.f.) of the speech and
the noise to estimate directly the cleaned speech in the log–spectrum.
Variants of SS and combinations with other techniques
Numerous improvements to the original SS have been proposed over time. Median smoothing
of the signal after the subtraction was found to reduce the “musical noise” as good as more
complicated schemes without the need for manual tuning of the parameters (Linhard and Klemm,
Ŝ(jw)
1997). Improvements in an intelligibility test have been reported when adapting the gain X(jw)
recursively (Linhard and Haulick, 1998). Singh and Srdiharan (1998) found that a critical band
SS, where the noise spectrum is considered constant in all frequency bins within a critical band,

CHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR

13

can improve the quality of the cleaned speech. Further, Virag (1995) incorporated masking across
critical bands (a known property of the human auditory system) into the SS scheme, claiming
improvements.
Spectral subtraction has been successfully integrated into the Parallel Model Combination
(PMC) approach to model compensation (Flores and Young, 1993). Both the means and the
variances of the HMM system ware compensated for the additive noise as well as for the degradation due to SS. Schless and Class (1998) used similar but simpler scheme where the musical noise
was balanced with SNR dependent α and β. The SS with masking has been used in conduction
with PMC (Drygajlo et al., 1995) as well. Section 2.8.1 discusses the PMC scheme for model
compensation in detail.
In almost all cases, it is very hard to asses if the improvements reported would generalise to an
ASR system in a particular setup. However, all real–world systems use some variant of spectral
subtraction. It is important to use exactly the same SS scheme both during the training (even on
clean speech) and testing, so that the models can “learn” the distortions introduced by the SS.

2.6.2

Wiener filtering

Wiener filtering is commonly used as alternative or complementary technique to spectral subtraction for removing additive noise. The filter is designed to minimise the minimum mean square
error (MMSE) in time domain and is a maximal likelihood filter if the distributions of the speech
and the noise are Gaussian. This assumption that the signals are quasi-stationary and distributed
Normally is common in speech processing (McAulay and Malpass, 1980). Vaseghi and Milner
(1993, 1997) used a Wiener filter in power spectral domain:
H(w) =

E{|S(jw)|2 }
E{|S(jw)|2 } + E{|N (jw)|2 }

(2.14)

Then, the magnitude of the cleaned speech is:
|Ŝ(jw)| = H(w)|X(jw)|

(2.15)

If the spectrum was computed from a infinite time series, the Wiener filter would be a particular
case of spectral subtraction. However, the mean of the clean speech (in addition to the mean of
the noise) is rarely available (except in mock experiments where the clean speech is available).
Two possible ways around this are:
• assuming piecewise stationarity of the speech and independence of the speech and noise, use
the mean noisy signal instead of the clean one (Stahl et al., 2000; Agarwal and Cheng, 1999)
• perform model adaptation instead of speech filtering (Beattie and Young, 1992; Vaseghi and
Milner, 1993, 1997; Downey, 1996). This is particularly attractive for HMM based systems.
The means of the clean speech are readily available as the means of the state p.d.f.s. The
distributions are Gaussian (or mixtures of). The quasi-stationarity of the speech is ensured
at state level.
Vaseghi and Milner (1997) compared Wiener filtering to SS and model adaptation on several
NOISEX noises and found that Wiener filtering outperformed SS and was close to model adaptation. Downey (1996) reported on isolated digits recognition in car noise where the Wiener filter
outperformed masking and SS and was as good as PMC.5 .

2.6.3

Noise masking

Noise masking is another commonly used technique for speech enhancement. It’s inspired by
a known effect in the auditory system where stronger signals mask the weaker ones in the sense
5 parallel model combination, Section 2.8.1

CHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR

14

that the weaker signal is not perceived. This can happen across the neighbouring frequency bands,
across time frames, etc. The masking property is exhibited at various levels of the human audition
chain as well (e.g. in the firing patterns of the neuron’s response (Moore, 1982)). The end result
is that the masked signal is not perceived. Examples of the effects of noise on the outputs of a
standard spectral log–filterbank representation are shown on Figure 3.2. This may be one of the
methods for noise suppression that human auditory system uses to enhance the local SNR. Features
incorporating forward and backward noise masking in time by essentially high–pass filtering the
cepstral trajectories were found to perform better both in clean and noisy speech then the cepstral
features alone (Aikawa et al., 1996).
One way to simulate the masking property is to detect the frequency bands where the energy
is below a certain threshold (and thus is believed to belong to the noise), and replace this value by
the value of the mask for the subsequent processing (Klatt, 1976). Therefore the variance because
of the noise is decreased. This was originally implemented in the context of a dynamic–time
warping (DTW) recogniser. In the original scheme if the bin in the template or the observation
are below the noise threshold they are replaced with it in the further calculation.
Bridle et al. (1984) introduced further refinements in the “noise marking” scheme. Depending
on the relation between the observation, the noise mask level and the template mean (or the
Gaussian state p.d.f. in the experiments by Varga and Ponting (1989)), the acoustic match score
is computed differently for each case.
Holmes and Sedgwick (1986) used a probabilistic interpretation and extension to a HMM–
based recogniser of the masking property. Assuming an environmental M AX model, the energy
of the speech must be below the energy of the noise when it is masked. Therefore, the noisy bins
that have masked the speech can still be used to weight against the models which have significant
energy in these bins. Further, a measure of the probability that a state generated the masked
speech was introduced: the area below the p.d.f. up to the noisy value. The usage of M AX model
is motivated by the observation that only in small number of bins the speech and the noise will
have comparable energy. In most of the bins, either the speech or the noise will dominate.
A systematic comparison of the three methods that utilise masking to achieve robustness found
Klatt’s method advantageous (Varga and Ponting, 1989). The following comparative summary
depicts the way the state emission probability is calculated with the proposed methods that utilise
masking for robustness:

Noise masking has also been successfully used together with PMC as an alternative to SS (Drygajlo et al., 1995). Mellor and Varga (1993) applied noise masking with MFCC features by masking
in the spectral domain and subsequently transforming the features. Noise masking was found to
perform as good as PMC down to 3dB, but worse for lower SNRs, on an isolated digits task.

Noisy–to–clean mapping

Another idea for achieving robustness is to find some kind of mapping between the noisy and clean
speech features. Applying this transformation to the noisy features would yield the clean ones. In
order to estimate the mapping, both clean and noisy versions of the signal are necessary. Next, the
form of the functional mapping has to be determined. The choice varies from simple parametric
types like linear regression (Mokbel et al., 1992) to non–parametric non–linear estimators such as
multi–layer perceptrons (MLP) (Mokbel et al., 1992; Gao and Haton, 1993; Trompf et al., 1993).
In order to optimise the mapping, a function measuring the similarity between the cleaned and
clean features has to be selected. Typically this is the mean square error (MSE) function. Then
the optimisation problem of searching for the parameters of the mapping to minimise the error
criterion can be solved with standard optimisation techniques. The choice of techniques is not
limited – for example, Kobayashi et al. (1993) employed an iterative procedure (using Wiener
filter) for maximisation of posterior probability (MAP) of an all–pole model.
The performance of this technique is limited by the assumptions it is based on. It depends
on how the chosen mapping function and error criterion suit a particular noise. So, while on the
same type of noise the mapping will yield good results, for different noise types the result can be
unpredictable.

2.6.5

Model based enhancement

The model based techniques explicitly assume a certain model of the clean speech and derive its
parameters from data. During the enhancement process, the noisy speech, constrained by the
model, is modified in such a way as to fit the model better. It is therefore considered enhanced. In
a similar way to the noisy–to-clean mapping in the previous section, the nature of the model and
the nature of enhancement determine the process and have to be decided upon beforehand. The
main difference from noisy–to-clean mapping is that an explicit model of clean speech is assumed
and the estimated from the data.
Short term spectral amplitude MMSE estimation
Ephraim and Malah (1984) derived an MMSE estimator of the short–time spectral amplitude
(STSA) to enhance speech contaminated with stationary additive noise. The STSA was assumed
to have normal probability density with mutually independent Fourier coefficients. The estimator
was further expanded to encompass the signal presence uncertainty. It was found that the STSA
estimate can be improved if it is conditioned on the probability of the signal being present or
absent. This effectively amounts to switching between two estimators. When the signal is absent
(noisy operating condition) the noise fills in the silence. The probability of presence/absence of
each spectral component was assumed independent of the others. The optimal estimator of the
phase under the same statistical model was derived as well. It was found to have nonunity modulus.
So, when combined with the STSA estimator, the resulting estimator is no longer optimal. It was
also discovered that the best phase estimator constrained to have modulus of one, is the phase of
the noisy signal. This is the reason why the phase of the noisy signal is usually used when the
enhanced speech is reconstructed.
Similar MMSE estimators but for log–spectral (Compernolle, 1989b) and for log–filterbank (Erell
and Weintraub, 1993a) domain respectively have also been derived. They either require a noise
model (Compernolle, 1989b), or estimate of the conditional distribution of the clean and the noisy
speech (Erell and Weintraub, 1993a), in addition to the clean speech model. The assumed combination of speech and noise was the additive model in power spectral domain. The latter method
was tested in the context of an HMM system (Erell and Weintraub, 1993b) on the RM task.
MMSE of log–filterbank features outperformed the one of STSA, and conditioning on the energy
gave big win for both techniques. All above mentioned estimators were reported to give increased
ASR accuracy over the respective baseline both when training on clean and noisy data.

CHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR

16

Using a–priori speech constraints
A feature enhancement scheme utilising the morphological constraints was used to compensate the
cepstral features of the recogniser for the adverse influence of additive noise, stress and Lombard
effect simultaneously (Hansen, 1994). Both the parameter enhancement and the stress compensation were conditioned on estimated noise mean and variance. The Lombard effect on the feature
vectors fed to the recogniser was modelled as an additive bias. It was conditioned on the so called
“stress class”, and was itself modelled as a random Gaussian variable. The limited amount of true
speech with Lombard effect was handled by parameter smoothing techniques. With all noises and
all SNRs significant improvements in performance over the baseline were obtained. Hansen and
Arslan (1995) used an iterative method that assumes an all pole model of speech for enhancement.
All constraints were derived from the fact that human articulators are a slowly moving physical
system:
• the all–pole model has to be stable
• the poles have to be at certain positions
• poles can not move too quickly from frame to frame.
The linear prediction (LP) model is one of the most commonly used speech models, since there is
a prior knowledge of what the all–pole model of the speech should look like,
Yegnanarayana et al. (1999) introduced the idea of identifying the high SNR regions in the
time–frequency plane and amplifying those regions correspondingly (instead of attenuation of the
low SNR regions). The identification of the regions is based on the measure of the flatness of the
LP spectrum. The measure draws from the ratio of energies of the linear predictors residual signal
of the clean and noisy speech. The same idea was also applied to enhancement of reverberant
speech (Yegnanarayana et al., 1999). Instead of SNR, a measure called Signal to Reverberant
component Ratio (SRR) was optimised. The LP residual is changed depending on the estimated
SRR to enhance the high SRR regions. In both cases the SNR rather then ASR accuracy was
measured and was reported to improve in additive noise.
Using speech HMM for enhancement
The speech model need not necessarily be a simple one. Couvreur and Hamme (2000) used an
HMM to model both the speech and the noise. The forward–backward algorithm was used to
get the posterior probability of all joint (speech, noise) states to have generated the noisy speech.
Alternatively, it is possible to find only the most probable sequence with a Viterbi search, taking a
hard decision for each frame. In either case, Parallel Model Combination (PMC – see Section 2.8.1)
can be used to obtain the parameters of the composite model. Once the state sequence or posterior
probabilities of the states given the noisy data are known, either a maximum likelihood (ML), or
maximum posteriori (MAP) estimate of the clean speech can be generated using state conditioned
Wiener filters. This complex speech model yielded significant improvements both in the quality
of the enhanced speech and the accuracy of its recognition.
An autoregressive HMM (AR–HMM) system was used in the same manner for speech enhancement (Logan and Robinson, 1998). Because of the AR–HMM, the additive property of the speech
and noise holds in the parameter domain too. So it is easier to derive the parameters of the composite (speech, noise) states. Only Viterbi search (with hard state–to–frame alignment) was used
to obtain an estimate of the cleaned speech. On a small vocabulary, speaker dependent task, the
compensated system trained on clean speech approached the performance of the system trained
on noisy speech.

2.7

Robust features

The term robust features refers to applying a transformation in the first stage of processing of
the speech signal (feature extraction) that will (hopefully) result in similar, if not the same,

CHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR

17

feature vectors both with speech used for training and speech that is to be recognised (Picone,
1993). Ideally, this should be possible regardless of the source of the variability. Because the
feature vectors won’t differ greatly, the subsequent processing will be the same in both cases.
Robust distance measures may be also employed, as the feature vectors will be “similar”, but not
the “same”. The distance measure is usually more important in the systems based on template
matching via dynamic time warping (DTW), then for the HMM based ones.
Hernando and Nadeu (1991) found that using autocorrelation of the signal instead of the
signal itself to fit an all pole model gives significant performance gain. This was applied together
with a distance measure operating in the cepstral domain. In a similarly motivated development,
in addition to autocorrelation–based features, the autocorrelation feature trajectory was filtered
with a high pass filter to suppress the slowly varying components prior to computing the cepstral
coefficients through a discrete cosine transform (Yuo and Wang, 1999).
Paliwal (1998) introduced spectral subbands centroid (SCC) features, and supplement cepstral
with SCC features to improve the robustness. The features are related to the formants of the
speech, but can be extracted easily and reliably from the power spectrum of the speech signal.
The spectrum is divided in small number of sections (3 to 4), and a number of subbands fall into
one section. The SCC feature is computed as:

where lm and hm are the lower and the higher edges of the m-th section of the spectrum, wm (f )

In another attempt to derive a robust feature extractor, a two–sided linear predictor followed
by singular value decomposition (SVD) was used to improve the resistance to additive noise (Wong
et al., 1993).
All authors reported improvements over the baseline systems. However, it is not clear whether
integrating different schemes results in further performance improvements.

2.7.1

Cepstral mean normalisation

Removing the slow variations out of cepstral features can be accomplished via cepstrum mean
normalisation (CMN) technique. This simply means calculating the mean of the cepstral features
over a word or sentence of speech, and removing (subtracting) the value out of the features. An
alternate strategy is to employ a speech/noise detector and calculate the mean only over the speech
parts. Subtraction in the cepstral domain removes the effect of convolutional noise on the signal
(the same is true for log-spectrum, too). Typically this is the impulse response of the microphone.
The technique is easy to implement, and effective (Stern et al., 1997). Extension of the technique,
termed segmental cepstrum mean normalisation (SCMN) incorporates estimation of the variance
(in addition to the mean) of each feature, and subsequent feature normalisation using both the
mean and the variance (Vikki and Laurila, 1997). Because it is very cheap and yet effective, some
variant of cepstral normalisation is part of almost every practical ASR system.

2.7.2

Perceptual linear prediction

A special form of linear predictive (LP) analysis (all pole modelling of the power spectrum)
known as Perceptual LP (PLP) (Hermansky, 1990) appears to be more effective in obtaining
noise resistant features then the ordinary LP. The central idea is to fit the poles to a warped,
Mel–scale spectrum, rather then the linear one. This is in line with with our knowledge about
human audition that not all frequencies are equally important (i.e. carry the same information
content) for ASR. The emphasis is on a better fit at the lower frequencies, to the expense of the
fit at the higher frequencies. Further, the Mel–scale introduces smoothing at the lower frequencies

CHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR

18

reducing the need for the all–pole model to fit the fine structure of the speech (as pitch harmonics)
that are unrelated to the vocal tract shape.
The technique incorporates two other properties of human hearing in further processing stages:
the critical band analysis is followed by equal loudness pre–emphasis (according to the equal
loudness curve) and intensity–to–loudness conversion (by taking the cubic root) before the LP
coefficients are computed. A discrete cosine transform is applied to the LP coefficients to compute
the final PLP features.
PLP of lower order seems to perform same or better then “ordinary” LP of higher order. PLP
is one of the two (the other being Mel–frequency cepstra) feature extraction frontends in wide use
in the ASR systems today (Hunt, 1999).
Kryze et al. (1999) replaced the Mel–scale filters with a hierarchical unbalanced tree of low–
and high–pass filters implementing a discrete wavelet transform to improve noise robustness. The
resulting transform has adaptive time–frequency resolution. Significant absolute improvement in
performance was reported on clean TIMIT data mixed with car noise.

2.7.3

Relative spectra

Hermansky and Morgan (1994) devised a representative relative spectra (RASTA) for handling
slowly varying additive and convolutional noise. The idea is to suppress any components in the
speech that change more slowly or quickly then the “typical” range of speech change. As PLP, it
is loosely inspired by human audition. Human perception tends to respond to a changes of the
value of the input in addition to the absolute value of the input itself.
The technique can be used in conjunction with PLP (Hermansky et al., 1991). The spectral
components that are obtained through the filter bank are compressed and filtered (the trajectory
of the filter bank output over time is itself filtered) to suppress constant factors in each of them.
The last step is all pole model estimation as with PLP. The basic technique, so called lin-log
RASTA, operates in log-spectral domain. Filtering the constant/slowly varying components in
this domain effectively subtracts from the signal the noise convolutional in time domain. The
original IIR filter used was:
H(z) =

0.2 + 0.1z −1 − 0.1z −3 − 0.2z −4
z −4 (1 − 0.98z −1 )

(2.16)

The frequency response of the filter features a sharp zero at 0Hz, suppressing the DC component
(convolutional noise in the log–spectral domain). The other two zeros are at 28.9 and 50Hz. The
pole at z = 0.98 was latter replaced with pole at z = 0.94.
However, filtering in the log-spectral domain does not compensate for additive (in time domain)
noise. After Hirsch et al. (1991) demonstrated that high pass filtering the envelope of the bands
can be effective for additive noise removal, RASTA was applied to a linear–like domain for small
spectral values and a logarithmic–like domain for large spectral values in order to compensate for
both types of noise. This variant is known as J-RASTA. The effect is easily achieved by adding
a small constant to the output of the filterbank before the log compression. This amounts to
noise masking. Hunt (1999) argued that this is the same as using root–compression nonlinearity
(for example used in PLP). Both ultimately achieve robustness by training the models with small
amount of added noise.
It is notable that the numerator of the filter, 0.2 + 0.1z −1 − 0.1z −3 − 0.2z −4 , is essentially
the transfer function of the delta–features calculation (Furui, 1986). Compared to RASTA, these
features are much more selective in their frequency response. RASTA’s passband is much broader.
Openshaw and Mason (1996) performed similar to RASTA filtering in spectral domain instead of
log–spectral domain.
Both RASTA and RASTA–PLP features appear to be effective with wide range of noises and
both with additive and convolutional noise. They have also produced improved performance with
reverberant speech.

2.7.4

Modulation spectrogram

The modulation spectrogram (Kingsbury et al., 1998) is another technique in the class of temporal
filtering of the time trajectories of the log-filterbank outputs (performed by RASTA or dynamic
features calculation, too).
Experiments on the relative importance of the modulation spectrum have indicated that components in the range of 1 to 16Hz are the primary carriers of the information required for ASR,
with a dominant component around 4Hz (Kanedera et al., 1997, 1998)6 . It seems that modulation
frequencies below 2 and above 10Hz become less important in noisy speech, while those below
1Hz significantly degrade the accuracy in noisy environment. Modulation spectrogram captures
information distributed over intervals of syllabic duration (100–250ms). Experiments with a hybrid HMM/MLP system demonstrated that incorporating the syllable length information either
by using modulation spectrogram features and/or using wider context input window (185ms instead of the usual 105ms) significantly decreased the word error rate (WER) both for clean and
reverberant speech Wu et al. (1998b).
The modulation spectrogram features are computed by analysing speech with a critical-band
FIR filterbank first. Greenberg and Kingsbury (1997) half–wave rectified each output of the
filterbank next, low-pass filtered it with 28Hz cut-off frequency, downsampled 100-fold, normalised
by its long term average, bandpass filtered so that only the modulation frequencies between 0
and 8kHz pass through, limited with dynamic range limiter of peak 30dB and smoothed with
bilinear transform at the end. Wu et al. (1998b) used a variant where the envelopes of the
quarter–octave FIR filterbank outputs where low–pass filtered, downsampled, then low–pass and
band–pass filtered, compressed with cubic–root compression and normalised with their global peak
(Figure 2.3).
Improvements were demonstrated on reverberant speech. On a large vocabulary ASR task
modulation spectrogram features have been found to carry complementary (to the PLP features)
information enhancing the performance (Robinson et al., 2000).

Other dynamic and trajectory filtering features

Although not always introduced specifically with the aim of improving robustness, various features
that emphasise the dynamic nature of the speech seem to increase the robustness of the ASR
systems. Derivatives can remove slowly changing convolutive noise when applied in log-spectral
or cepstral domain; the same is true for additive noise with the derivatives applied in spectral
domain. The derivatives of the “static” features are calculated either via simple difference, or via
regression (Furui, 1986). Those regression features are part of almost all ASR systems today:
PN
nx(t − n)
∆x(t) = n=−N
(2.17)
PN
2
n=−N n
The difference and the regression dynamic features can be of the first, second or higher orders.
Regression derivatives of 1st, 2nd and 3rd order have been found to increase the robustness of the
models trained on cleaned speech and tested on Lombard speech (Hanson and Applebaum, 1990).
Interestingly, inclusion of the static features neither improved nor hindered the performance. Since
each additional set of derivatives significantly increases the feature vector dimensionality, and some
of them are correlated, PCA can be used to truncate the feature vector by removing the redundant
features (Trompf et al., 1993).
Hirsch et al. (1991) found that high pass filtering of the trajectories of the log–filterbank
features features increased performance both in clean and noisy conditions. A simple IIR filter
was used:
y(n) = x(n) − x(n − 1) + 0.7y(n − 1)
(2.18)
In a more general approach, features extracted from a full two dimensional Mel–cepstrum
(TDMC) were used to increase the performance in clean and in noisy speech (Kitamura et al.,
1992; Milner, 1996). TDMC is defined as a two-dimensional Fourier transform of Mel–scaled log
spectra in the frequency and time domains. The ways of selecting an appropriate subset of TDMC
features is also discussed in these papers.
More data–driven approaches have been applied recently to the task of filtering the time trajectories of the spectral parameters (Nadeu et al., 1997; Avendano and Hermansky, 1997). Nadeu
et al. (1997) designed optimal filters for the time trajectories suited to a particular task/speech
database. The derived filters tend to support the claim of the importance of the modulation frequencies around the syllable rate (3Hz on the database that was used). Avendano and Hermansky
(1997) designed filters for speech enhancement. The criterion for optimal mapping was MMSE,
and clean and noisy speech at various SNRs from the TIMIT database were used to derive the
filters. It was found that:
• the filters for high SNRs were quite flat
• the filters for mid SNRs were band–pass, enhancing the modulation frequency of around 5Hz
• at low SNRs, the filters were low gain, low cut–off frequency and low–pass

2.7.6

Feature normalisation

Tibrewala and Hermansky (1998); Hakkinen et al. (1999) reported on a simple technique of on–line
normalisation of feature mean and variance, effective with a wide range of noises. The statistical
models of the today’s ASR systems on average perform better if fed with features with roughly the
same means (preferably 0) and variances (preferably 1). It is computationally cheap to normalise
them with a first order recursion:
µ(t)

= αµ(t − 1) + (1 − α)x(t)

s(t) = αs(t − 1) + (1 − α)x2 (t)
σ 2 (t) = s(t) − µ2 (t)
x(t) − µ(t)
x̄(t) =
σ(t)

(2.19)

CHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR

21

where x(t) is the feature that is used for recognition (filterbank energy, cepstral coefficient, LP
coefficient) and x̄ is the “normalised” feature fed in the recogniser. A typical value for α is
α = 0.995. The transformation is applied to each feature independently.
Tibrewala and Hermansky (1998) reported 75% decrease in word error rate on the task of
recognising isolated digits with a wide range of noises. At low SNRs it was found that both
the mean and the variance normalisation contribute equally to the improvement. At high SNRs
normalising the mean alone was enough to achieve the improved performance.

2.7.7

Spectral peaks

While studying highly distorted sine–wave speech (SWS), (Barker and Cooke, 1997; Barker, 1998)
used spectral peaks for robust speech recognition. SWS is speech produced by time varying sinusoids mimicking the amplitude and frequency variation of the first three formants. Tests on the
Resource Management (RM) corpus showed improvement when peaks were used in recognition,
regardless whether they were used during training.
Decrease of WER on a discrete–word recognition task was also reported when position and
motion of the dominant spectral peaks were incorporated into a conventional Hidden Markov
Model (HMM) based system (Strope and Alwan, 1998). The system detects peaks on the outputs
of auditory filters with automatic gain control (AGC), groups them together into threads and
smoothes the trajectory by fitting it into a second order polynomial. Again, peaks (and their
derivatives) were used together with other features (cepstral coefficients and their derivatives).
It is regularly observed that the spectral peaks are less affected by noise then the “valleys”
that fill with noise. Figure 2.4 shows smoothed spectrogram–like features on the left panels in
clean condition (a), 20dB factory noise (b) and 0dB (c). On the middle panels (d), (e) and (f)
are the corresponding spectral peaks features. It is notable that they change much less then the
whole spectrum. However, many spurious peaks arise as the SNR decreases. This is due to the
definition of a spectral peak employed here: in each frame, channels with energy higher then their
neighbouring channels are marked to contain a spectral peak (Barker, 1998). The right panels
(g), (h) and (i) show three exemplary spectral slices of the clean speech (the black line), the 20dB
(green line) and the 0dB noisy speech (the blue line). As the SNR decreases, the spectral peaks
are the last to be covered with noise.

2.7.8

Auditory motivated robust features

Since human audition is so robust to noise, many researchers have tried to replicate the better
known parts of the human auditory chain in hope of achieving robustness.
The Ensemble Interval Histogram (EIH) (Ghitza, 1986) features were derived from a computational model of the auditory nerve–fibre firing pattern. There are 85 cochlear filters followed by
level crossing counters over a finite time interval. The representation preserves fine spectral detail
in low–frequency regions and fast time response in the high–frequency regions. It was compared
to, and found to be more robust than an FFT derived frontend.
Hunke et al. (1998) used an auditory frontend of 120 FIR filters with frequency response
derived from the solution of a 3-D cochlear hydrodynamic model. Similarly to the modulation
spectrogram, the model (among other things) encompasses an automatic gain control (AGC),
saturation of the magnitude at 30dB and downsampling to the rate of 100Hz so that it can be
used as a plug-in replacement for a standard ASR frontend. The robustness was compared with
MFCC, RASTA and J-RASTA and was significantly better (especially at lower SNRs) with the
majority of the noises.
Tian et al. (1998) took a similar approach with a frontend that consisted of: FFT, intensity
to loudness conversion and equal loudness correction, Mel–scaling and loudness–to–firing rate
conversion. The model of Dobrin et al. (1995) went further by feeding the firing rate into a model
of the central auditory system for recognition of isolated words. Gao et al. (1992) incorporated
a feedback block to simulate the efferent–induced depression of the basilar membrane motion in
addition to the (more or less) standard model of auditory periphery. Patterson et al. (1994)’s

Auditory Image Model (AIM) is binaural and mimics both the frequency analysis of the cochlea
and the lateral analysis in the midbrain. The frequency and the laterality are the two dimensions
of the representation. In addition, temporal integration takes place in each point in the plane,
effectively adding a half dimension. The neural activity is buffered and when large peak is detected,
it is added pointwise to the previous pattern stored in a static buffer. The integration stabilises
periodic patterns.
Perdigao and Sa (1998) compared several auditory models with the commonly used features
(RASTA, J-RASTA, MFCC, LPC) on a common task of isolated digits recognition. Almost
all of the proposed auditory motivated features perform better then the “conventional” MFCC
frontend7 , and especially in noise.
However, it seems that the consensus between the speech technologists is that the drawbacks of
the auditory inspired models outweigh their gains and none are widely used in the practical ASR
systems. For example, the AIM model generates 10000 features per frame – 3 orders of magnitude
more then the MFCC frontend. A more general problem with the auditory features is that they
are all fairly redundant and mutually dependent. The present statistical ASR systems are better
suited to compact and independent feature representations. Smaller number of as independent

features as possible reduces the number of parameters of the system thus reducing the amount
of training data needed. Further, although all are derived from the knowledge gathered while
exploring the human auditory system, application of the auditory models usually requires tuning
of a significant number of parameters.

2.8

Model adaptation

Techniques from this group aim to compensate the mismatch between the training and the testing
conditions by suitably modifying the parameters of the models. Usually, researchers strive to
make the new model parameters same or similar enough to the parameters that would have been
estimated if all training data was spoken in the particular noisy condition that the recogniser
is decoding at the moment. With rare exceptions, almost all techniques try to compensate for
additive and/or convolutional noise, disregarding the Lombard effect. The speech is assumed to be
independent of the noise. Therefore, the speech and the noise models can be inferred separately,
making the techniques from this group very attractive. When the noise source changes, only the
new noise model needs to be trained. This approach fits well the HMM based systems where the
physical meaning of the parameters is well understood.
There are two unknown factors in the process: the statistical distribution of the noise, and
how the speech and the noise combine to give the noisy observation.
The noise can be either known in advance, or it can be estimated on–line from the noisy speech.
If it is known in advance, it can be modelled just as the speech is. For a fairly stationary noise,
a single state model would suffice. For more complicated noises, a two state model has to be
estimated. Noises requiring more then two states are rarely utilised in laboratory tests. On–line
noise estimation is more attractive as in theory it adapts the recogniser to the noise at recognition
time, accommodating for noises unknown at training time. However, it is much harder and less
successful then off–line noise estimation. It is typically achieved with some sort of speech activity
detector. Noise is estimated during the speech pauses. It is implicitly assumed that the noise will
be fairly stationary and will not change significantly until the next pause. Usually only simple
(mono–state) noises are estimated this way. Section 4.4 reviews various on–line noise estimation
techniques in more detail.
Rose et al. (1994) treated the problems in combining the known speech and noise models
to obtain a noisy model with very general acoustic environment functions (governing how the
speech and noise combine together to produce the noisy speech) in detail. Specific examples,
with functions like additivity in the spectral domain, additivity in log–spectral domain and the
maximum in log–spectral domain were considered.
The model of the acoustic environment that is most commonly used is Eq. (2.2). It naturally
arises from the physics of the sound. However, it is not the only one. For the purposes of spectral
subtraction in magnitude domain additivity in the spectral magnitude domain has been assumed
(Section 2.6.1). It has also been noticed that in the log–spectral domain, for the case of additive
noise, the M AX approximation (observed speech being maximum of the speech and the noise)
holds pretty well and simplifies the speech and noise combination (Nadas et al., 1989; Rose et al.,
1994; Varga and Moore, 1990; Holmes and Sedgwick, 1986; Gales, 1997). This model and its
implications will be discussed in more detail in Chapter 3.
In many approaches there is not a strict divide between model and feature compensation.
Since the parameters of the used models (notably HMMs with Gaussian functions for state p.d.f.)
have straightforward interpretation in relation to the features (i.e. they are the means and the
variances of the features), the computed compensation factors can be applied in the feature, as
well as in the parameter domain (Moreno, 1996; Beattie and Young, 1992; Vaseghi and Milner,
1993; Downey, 1996).

2.8.1

Parallel model combination

Parallel model combination (PMC) (Gales, 1995) is a popular technique for compensation of the
effects both of additive and convolutional noise. The noise has to be known in advance (this is
more often the case), or estimated on–line. The means alone, or the means and the variances of
the speech models can be compensated. The technique allows for compensation of the mixture
weights (in the iterative version) as well as the number of mixtures (but this is rarely used).
The assumed acoustic environment model is Eq. (2.2). Since the equations involved don’t have
a closed form solution, there are several PMC variants depending on the assumptions made in
order to obtain an approximate solution. We will consider the case of PMC in additive noise. The
convolutive noise in spectral domain amounts to additive noise in the log–spectral (and cepstral
domain). If both the speech and the noise are distributed normally, their sum is going to be
distributed normally, too, and the compensation is straightforward. The only inconvenience is
when both are modelled with Gaussian mixtures. Then the number of noisy mixtures for the
noisy speech is going to be a product of the numbers of mixtures of the speech and the noise
models. Fortunately, a single Gaussian is usually sufficient to model the noise.
The simplest case of PMC with additive noise is when both the speech and the noise are single
Gaussians. The non–iterative PMC assumes that the distribution of the corrupted speech is going
to be Gaussian, too8 , and that the maximal likelihood state alignment (in clean speech) obtainable
via Viterbi search is not going to change because of the noise.
If the feature parameters are cepstral, then models parameters (means and variances) have to
be mapped back to log–linear domain (superscript cep denotes cepstral, log log–spectral and lin
spectral domain, and subscript pmc denotes the compensated speech parameters, s clean speech
parameters and n noise parameters):
µlog
Σlog

=
=

C −1 µcep
C −1 Σcep (C −1 )T

(2.20)

where C is the discrete cosine transform (DCT) matrix with Ci,j = cos(i(j − 0.5)π/B) (B is the
number of filterbank channels). Since usually less then B cepstral coefficients are retained, there
are not enough to correctly reconstruct the log–spectral parameters. Zeros are appended instead,
with small loss in accuracy (the higher cepstral coefficients are truncated because they carry little
information useful for ASR).
One possibility for evaluation of the moments of the noisy speech distribution is via numerical
integration. The compensated mean in the log domain can be estimated as:
log
µlog
+ E{log(exp(slog ) + exp(nlog ))}
pmc = µ

(2.21)

One efficient approximation is shown in (Gales, 1995).
Another possibility is to assume that the sum of two log–normally distributed random variables
is a random variable log–normally distributed itself. In that case (Gales, 1995):
µlin
pmc

lin
= µlin
s + µn

Σlin

= Σlin

(2.22)

Then the compensated parameters in the log–spectral domain are:

(2.23)

The third possibility is to ignore the variance of the speech as well as the noise and straightforwardly compensate the mean:
log
log
µlog
pmc = log(exp(µs ) + exp(µn ))
8 This is a poor assumption as it is most often bimodal (Gales, 1995; Moreno, 1996)

Those parameters are used for recognition of the noisy speech.
The non–iterative PMC is fast and efficient. It has been extended to compensate multiple Gaussian mixtures per state (Yang and Haavisto, 1995) and simple (Gales, 1995) or more complex (Yang
et al., 1995; Crafa et al., 1998) dynamic parameters (differences or regression parameters) of the
first and second order. For the cases where a multistate noise model is required, the speech and
the noise models can be concatenated into a composite speech–noise model (Fig. 2.5) (Martin,
1993).
The iterative PMC version (Gales, 1995) doesn’t assume a single maximum likelihood alignment that is not going to change. Instead, much like in the Baum–Welch HMM training, each
feature vector can be generated by every state with a certain probability. Thus, the assumption
about one–to–one mapping between the clean and the noisy speech Gaussians in the mixture
is relaxed, and a maximum likelihood fit for the Gaussian mixture given the noisy data can be
sought9 . Therefore the modelling capability is greatly improved. The problem of having no closed
form solution for the compensation equations is exaggerated here since the numerical solution can
not be used – it would involve computationally costly multidimensional integration. Data–driven
PMC (DPMC) (Gales, 1995) circumvents the problem by drawing (generating) sufficient number
of clean speech and noise samples from their respective distributions, combining these two sets
with the assumed model of acoustic environment, and then using the noisy samples for a standard
ML estimate of the parameters of the state p.d.f. Gaussian mixture. Crafa et al. (1998) introduced a Bayesian variant of DPMC which relies on a prior general noisy speech model. It uses
a weighted combination of the means (and variances) of the apriori general noisy speech model
(trained on speech with added noise) and the means (and variances) estimated via DPMC. The
advantage is that less samples need to be drawn via DPMC in this case (for the same accuracy in
noisy distribution estimation).
There have been number of extensions and applications of the basic technique to different ASR
systems setups. Docio-Frnandez and Garcia-Mateo (1998) addressed the problem of lack of enough
9 usually the noisy speech distribution retains the same number of mixtures as the clean speech for practical
reasons

data for robust estimate of the noise model. A library of noises in the form of Gaussian mixtures
was trained off–line. In the two variants of the method, either the on–line noise data was used to
select a few of the Gaussians from the library with the highest posterior probabilities, or, the library
“model” (in the form of single mixtures–single states with ergodic “grammar”) was incorporated
into the Viterbi search like a model to be matched in the beginning of each sentence. Flores and
Young (1993) compensated the distortion of the speech caused by non–linear SS within the PMC
framework. Plain SS has been used in conjunction with PMC (Schless and Class, 1998), as well as
SS with parameters adapted according to the auditory noise masking thresholds (Drygajlo et al.,
1995). Selective PMC compensation, where only the unreliable features with local SNR (estimated
vie spectral subtraction) below a certain threshold were compensated was shown to perform better
then plain PMC in a noisy digit recognition task (Renevey and Drygajlo, 1999).

2.8.2

HMM decomposition

HMM decomposition (Varga and Moore, 1990) is a general technique for simultaneous recognition
of any number of signal sources modelled with a discrete state space model. It is a Viterbi search
through the expanded joint N–dimensional state space of all N models. Figure 2.6 illustrates the
search for the case of two sources. The “recogniser” Eq. (2.8) can in this case be expanded as:
(W 10 , W 20 ) = argmaxP (W 1, W 2|O) = argmaxP (O|W 1, W 2)P (W 1, W 2)
(W 1,W 2)

In each joint state in the expanded space the probability of a particular observation10 (observed
in that frame) has to be computed. The computation depends on the function of the acoustic
environment, that governs how the sources combine together to produce the single observation.
For example, if the assumed environment is Eq. (2.2), the joint distribution of combined state
can be obtained via PMC. For a general “mixing operator” ⊗ the probability of observation O
is (Varga and Moore, 1991) (the subscript denotes the source number):
I
P1 ⊗ P2 (O) =
P (O1 , O2 )
(2.27)
C

where C is the contour of all couples (O1 , O2 ) such that O = O1 ⊗ O2 .
It has already been noted that in the case of a log–filterbank features and additive noise model
in the spectral domain the max operator is a good approximation (Holmes and Sedgwick, 1986;
Nadas et al., 1989). Because of the compression the log function exhibits, it can be approximated
with: log(O1 + O2 ) ≈ log(max{O1 , O2 }). Therefore for model decomposition (Varga and Moore,
1991):
P (O) =
=

P (max{O1 , O2 }) = P (O1 < O2 )P (O2 ) + P (O2 < O1 )P (O1 )
C(O2 , µ1 , σ1 )N (O2 , µ2 , σ2 ) + C(O1 , µ2 , σ2 )N (O1 , µ1 , σ1 )

(2.28)

where N (O, µ, σ) is the Normal distribution and C(O, µ, σ) is the cumulative probability function
RO
of the normal distribution −∞ N (x, µ, σ)dx.
Kadirkamanathan (1992) tested the max operator and two alternatives: a three piece linear approximation and non–iterative PMC with log–normal approximation (Eqs. (2.22) and (2.23)) (Gales
and Young, 1992). They were compared on an isolated digits recognition task with artificially
added noise. It was concluded that the three piece approximation performed somewhat better
then the max operator, and that the PMC adaptation offered no advantage, especially at lower
SNRs. The model (de)composition technique is a general search for the most likely explanation
when multiple concurrent independent processes influence the observation. Takiguchi et al. (2000)
used the technique to model different acoustic transfer functions arising when the speaker is in
various positions relative to the microphone. Three positions were considered, and were assigned
10 can be naturally expanded to handle multiple observations, as well

speech HMM model
Figure 2.6: Decomposing an observed sequence
to the states of an ergodic HMM. The recognition was carried out with model decomposition,
explaining the observed acoustics in terms of the words uttered and the position of the speaker.
Model decomposition can be used to infer both the speech and the noise model from speech
contaminated with noise. The only hurdle is that the training is much slower because of the
combined models space. The ML formulae for the forward–backward algorithm have been derived
repeatedly by Kadirkamanathan and Varga (1991) and Graciarena (2000). Both used the M AX
environmental model. Kadirkamanathan and Varga (1991) experimented with multistate noise
models and found that much of the data is explained by the noise, making the speech models
sharper. Graciarena (2000) experimented with a single state noise model and noted an improvement, over using a clean speech model together with noise model derived from manually selected
“noise only” portions of the database.
Although it has not been attempted (because the combined models space expands exponentially
with the number of models involved, and so does the computational cost), it is possible to infer
models that explain the observations in multiple dimensions like speech (the words spoken), gender,
speaking rate, distance and direction to the microphone, etc. Any number of sources of variability
can be thrown in. The mixing function on a state level must be chosen appropriately to explain
how they combine to produce the observed data. The sources of variability could be “peeled off”
from the observations this way, instead of bundled together. This may result not only in sharper
models, but in extraction of models that can be combined independently to match the conditions
during the recognition (e.g. gender, speaking rate, etc.).

2.8.3

The RATZ and STAR family of algorithms

The Multivariate–Gaussian–Based Cepstral Normalisation (RATZ) Statistical Reestimation (STAR)
(Moreno, 1996; Stern et al., 1996) algorithms refer to the same idea applied in features space
(RATZ) or in the models space (STAR). The assumed acoustic environment model is Eq. (2.2).
It is rewritten as:
x = s + g(s, h, n)
(2.29)

CHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR

28

where
g(s, h, n) = h + 10 log10 (1 + 10

n−s−h
10

)

(2.30)

is the additive environmental bias, and x, s, h, n are the noisy speech, the clean speech, the convolutive noise and the additive noise in the log–power domain. It is assumed that the distribution of
the noisy speech is Gaussian, and the mean and the variance of its distribution can be expressed
as (Moreno, 1996):
µx
Σx

= µs + E{g(s, h, n)}
= Σs + µs µTs + E{g(s, h, n)g(s, h, n)T } + E{s g(s, h, n)T } − µx µTx

(2.31)

Both compensated parameters can be expressed as a sum of the parameters of the clean speech
distribution plus correction factors. Since there are no closed form solutions, the distributions
of the noises h and n are assumed to be Gaussian and independent too. Then the integrals are
approximately computed by drawing sufficient number of samples from the speech and the noise(s)
distributions (i.e. using Monte–Carlo methods, the same way as DPMC in Section 2.8.1).
The correction factors are computed for each Gaussian in an HMM system with Gaussian
mixtures as state p.d.f.s. The number of the Gaussians and their apriori probabilities (the mixture
weights) stay the same. If a stereo (paired clean and noisy) data is available, the correction factors
can be computed directly by using the state/frame aligned data. Without stereo data, when it is
not known which state generated which frame, an iterative Expectation Maximisation algorithm
is derived and utilised.
After the correction factors are found, the hypothesised distribution of the noisy speech is fully
known. STAR then proceeds with the recognition of the noisy speech. RATZ compensates the
feature vectors, therefore, it has derive a single estimate ŝ of the clean speech s when the noisy
one x is observed. It was chosen to obtain the MMSE estimate ŝMMSE = E{s|x}.
In addition to blind and stereo variants of RATZ and STAR, there are also several other variants
like interpolated, SNR dependent, etc, differing in the amount of the assumed prior knowledge
about the acoustic environment.

2.8.4

Polynomial approximation of the acoustic environment function

The intractability of the non–linear mismatch function (Eq. (2.30)) between the clean and the noisy
speech in the “usual” model of the acoustic environment (Eq. (2.2)) was the reason for employing
various approximations and numerical simulations to calculate the distribution of the degraded
speech. Another way to tackle the evaluation problem is to use a polynomial series expansion of
the mismatch function (Eq. (2.30)) close to the points of interest, thus easing the computation
of the noisy speech distribution while retaining reasonable accuracy of approximation (Moreno,
1996; Kim et al., 1998; Raj et al., 1997).11
Moreno (1996) carried out a Vector Taylor series compensation (VTS) in the log–power domain
using first and second order expansion. The vector Taylor series approximation of the mismatch
function in the neighbourhood of s0 is (Moreno, 1996):
g(s, h, n) ≈ g(s0 , h, n) + g0 (s0 , h, n)(s − s0 ) +

1 00
g (s0 , h, n)(s − s0 )2 + . . .
2

(2.32)

where the first derivative of the vector function g(s, h, n) with respect to the vector s evaluated at
s0 is a diagonal matrix, the second derivative is a diagonal 3-D tensor, etc... In the “blind” case
the adaptation has to be iterated in EM fashion since the state/frame alignment is not known in
advance.
Raj et al. (1997) estimated the moments of the noisy speech similarly to VTS, and then these
moments are used to fit a straight line approximation of the environment function in a method
called Vector Polynomial Approximations (VPS). In addition to model compensation, it was also
used for speech enhancement – the MMSE estimate of the clean speech given the noisy speech
11 Couvreur and Hamme (2000) used the same technique in the context of model–base speech enhancement

CHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR

29

and its (derived by compensation) distribution was calculated. Kim et al. (1998) applied the
technique in cepstral domain. First order blind VTS with assumed constant convolutional noise h
and normally distributed additive noise n was tested on isolated and connected word recognition
task with artificially added white car noise at various SNRs. It was found to perform better then
PMC with log–normal approximation, especially at lower SNRs.

2.8.5

Stochastic matching based methods

It has already been mentioned in the Sections 2.8.1, 2.8.3 and 2.8.4 that in the “blind” case, when
no state/frame aligned data is available, one can resort to iterative model/state alignment followed
by parameter reestimation. This was termed stochastic matching by Shankar and Lee (1995). It
is a general technique applicable with any (assumed) model of the acoustic environment. This
model need not have a physical meaning (like Eq. (2.2)), but merely a convenient form to allow for
derivation of the update formulas for the unknown parameters. One of most popular forms (due
to its simplicity) for a mismatch function is the linear regression function (Shankar and Lee, 1995;
Siohan et al., 1995). Other functions that have been used include projection–based likelihood
measure (Chien et al., 1998) as well as various non–linear functions (Wong and Shi, 1998).
This method is widely used for speaker adaptation, i.e. modification of the models to model
the current speaker better. Usually, a small amount of speaker dependent (SD) data is available
and the task is to adapt the speaker independent (SI) models using the SD data. In addition
to maximising the likelihood (ML criterion), other criteria can be optimised like the maximum
posteriori probability (MAP) or the minimal classification error (MCE).
In general, the methods from this class tend to be used in addition to other noise robustness
measures, rather then on their own.

2.8.6

Discriminative training

It is possible to improve the robustness of the recogniser by improving the discrimination between
the units/models of the recogniser. This is typically achieved by discriminative training (Mizuta
and Nakajima, 1992). Since in mismatched conditions the observations are “outliers” to (not drawn
from) the original speech distribution, one way to limit the damage is to make the borders between
units/models as wide as possible to decrease the possibility of misrecognition. The discriminative
training objective function not only increases the likelihood of the correct classification, but also
decreases the probability of misclassification. The optimisation method is usually some form of
Generalised Probabilistic Descent (GPD) on the error function. Chu and Zhao (1998) paired discriminative training with a SNR dependent weighting of the dynamic features. Merhav and Lee
(1993) explicitly assessed the sensitivity of the models to the conditions mismatch through a generalised likelihood ratio test. This test asymptotically achieves exponentially decaying probability
of error for the worst–case mismatch condition.
The discriminative training aims to achieve maximal a–priori (before any noise is seen) robustness to mismatched conditions and it can be easily complemented with other techniques for
improving the robustness to noise.

2.9

Combinations of techniques in real systems

In real–world applications different techniques are usually combined in the same system to achieve
maximal effect.
Mokbel et al. (1997) used several techniques at different levels of the recognition process in an
ASR system for telephone speech (mobile and fixed). In the feature space:
• cepstral normalisation was used to remove the long term channel effects
• cepstral feature trajectories were high pass filtered

CHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR

30

• adaptive filtering implementing blind equalisation in the frequency domain was employed to
minimise the MSE between the long term spectrum of the speech coming to the recogniser
and the “typical” long term spectrum of the speech
• spectral subtraction was carried out as a next step in the chain to remove the additive noise
An on–line noise estimate was (re)estimated during the speech pauses. For this purpose, a five
state model (silence, speech presumption, speech, plosive or silence, possible speech continuation)
with transitions conditioned on the ratio between the short– and long–term frame energy was
used. An end–point detector was also employed to ease the dialog management. The HMM model
parameters were adapted as well. The optimisation criterion was MAP, alleviating the problem of
insufficient adaptation data. The mapping from the original to the compensated models space was
linear regression. The lack of adaptation data was further handled by clustering the Gaussians of
the distributions to use the same data. At the higher level, several garbage models were trained
on non–speech and out–of–vocabulary speech data. Significant performance gains were reported,
making the system operate on both land and cellular phone lines speech.
Similarly, Compernolle (1989a) used spectral subtraction and automatic gain control. The
noise estimator used histograms based (see Section 4.4 in Chapter 4) speech/noise discriminator.
A small amount of noise was also used to mask the environment–dependent residuals. Spectral
subtraction and thresholding (effectively masking), noise robust acoustic representation and noise–
robust spectral distortion measures were used in (Bateman et al., 1992). RASTA filtered cepstral–
time matrices and garbage models improved the performance of a telephone based system for town
names recognition (Azzopardi et al., 1998). Spectral subtraction, features based on autocorrelation
and spectral shaping, multiple microphones for spectrum equalisation and multiple models were
used in a ASR system for car environment (Nakamura et al., 1993).
In all cases, the error rates have dropped, as expected. However, no end–user studies have
been reported on how the techniques affect the usability of the automated systems in challenging
conditions, and whether the systems actually achieve a satisfactory level of performance.

2.10

Summary

A variety of techniques aimed at increasing the robustness of the ASR systems in noisy conditions
were reviewed in this chapter. In all cases the techniques employed alleviate the corruptive influence of the environment on the system performance, but rarely manage to bring it to the level
of performance achieved in good conditions. Table A.1 in Appendix A is an incomplete list of
improvements in the accuracy of various ASR systems with proposed techniques for robust ASR.
We are far from a comprehensive framework that would encompass and account for all the
sources of speech variability in the real–life applications. The present methods also suffer from a
variety of problems:
• model based schemes rarely compensate all parameters due to lack of data and computational
costs;
• incorporating the noise variance in the models increases their variance and decreases the
discriminability;
• feature compensation techniques lack the benefit of piecewise stationarity imposed by the
models;
• the “inherently robust” features are robust to some noises and much less robust to others;
• the prevailing cepstral features tend to smear the noise (which in most cases is quite localised
in the time–frequency plane) over all features in the feature vector.
It seems that although the robustness of the recogniser does improve when one or more of the
above reviewed techniques are incorporated in it, the level of performance is not good enough for

CHAPTER 2. A REVIEW OF ROBUST ASR

31

many (envisaged) applications, and at present it is at least two orders of magnitude worse then
what humans achieve in the same conditions (Lippmann, 1996).

Chapter 3

Missing data in speech processing
3.1

Introduction

In this chapter the idea that parts of the speech spectrum may be obscured by sounds from other
sources will be discussed. Arguments supporting the idea from various sources will be put forward.
It will be argued that the recognition should be performed in two distinct steps: (a) grouping of
the evidence coming from the speech source of interest; and (b) adaptation of the recogniser to
handle the partial speech. Techniques for pattern classification that enable the adaptation of the
statistical systems will be reviewed, and their merits for this purpose assessed. Toward the end,
previous studies of using the missing data approach to robust speech and speaker recognition will
be reviewed, and relations to similar techniques highlighted.

3.2

Motivation

The claim that parts of the speech can be obscured and not observable is fairly unintuitive. A
similar claim for vision is much more natural because most visual objects are opaque. Objects
in the near field of vision regularly hide far field objects from our view. Yet we have no problem
observing their existence when they are only partially visible. However, when it comes to speech,
our intuition suggests that the effect of the sound scene must be additive. After all, the physics of
sound make it so. Techniques like blind source separation (Section 4.3) that rely on this assumption
have demonstrated sound separation when their preconditions are satisfied. However, it is known
that in the human auditory system the louder sounds obscure the quieter ones. This happens
at several levels, effectively removing the quieter sounds from the subsequent processing stages.
Thus, for the purpose of hearing they are lost. We support this claim by several arguments:
(a) The masking occurring at various levels in the auditory chain makes the masked speech
effectively lost for subsequent processing and thus missing. Forward and backward masking in the time–frequency (T–F) plane, and masking in the frequency bands surrounded
by more energetic neighbouring bands is routinely used in speech coding and compression
(ex: ISO/IEC 11172-3 (1993); ISO/IEC 13818-3 (1995)). Another example is the “capture
effect” exhibited in the neural code. The most intense component dominates the neural
response both in terms of the firing rate and the temporal response pattern (Moore, 1982).
Lateral suppression and inhibition (discharge rate reduction in the presence of additional
signal) at the level of a single fibre in the inner ear is also documented. (Greenberg, 1997).
(b) In natural auditory scenes, the number of sources is almost never one, and most of the time it
is probably at least three. In addition, the role the speaker’s attention plays in attending one
source while pushing the rest in the “acoustic background”, may make missing data/masking
much more ubiquitous in real life than in controlled artificial environments with a single
acoustic source.
32

CHAPTER 3. MISSING DATA IN SPEECH PROCESSING

33

(c) Communication via restricted bandwidth channels occurs on a daily basis between human
listeners. Telephone speech is one example. Interfering band–limited noises are frequent in
the natural acoustic environment. Yet humans don’t have any problems when large parts of
the spectrum are missing.
(d) Humans handle severe alterations of the signal in the time–frequency domain gracefully.
Low and high pass filtered speech (Allen, 1994) and speech filtered through narrow and
steep bandpass filters (Warren et al., 1995; Steeneken, 1992) retains very high intelligibility
suggesting that:
• speech is redundant and can be intelligible even if only small parts of the spectrum are
available
• human audition can adapt to partial, scattered and sparse evidence in the time–
frequency plane
(e) There is enough evidence by now suggesting that the human auditory system organises the
concurrent signals into perceptual streams (Bregman, 1990), regardless if it is confronted
with complex signals like speech or much simpler signals. The organisation seems to be
influenced both by bottom–up primitive rules and top–down schemas. The computational
models of this problem of “binding” the multiple sensory information to a particular source
in the auditory scene typically assign each observation to a single source only. All the
criteria for organisation can rely only on the prior knowledge that physically distinct sources
are independent. A typical organisation then looks for a subset of sufficiently (statistically)
dependent signals which are sufficiently (statistically) independent from the other signals.
(f) From purely signal processing point of view: the human hearing periphery exhibits a strong
compression transfer function, often loosely mimicked by log or cubic root compression
following the spectral analysis in the todays ASR systems feature extraction module. The
compression makes the approximation of a sum by a max operator much more viable. The
downside of the compression non–linearity is that the signal must have large enough dynamic
range so that the information transfer remains possible. The speech signal has a dynamic
range of more then 12 orders of magnitude. In addition to this, speech (and other sources)
too exhibit quite sparse representation in the time–frequency plane.
The bottom two panels of Figure 3.1 show a T–F representation (after the compression) of both
the clean speech and noisy speech at global SNR of 0dB. Both are “seen through” the mask which
selects the points where the speech is more energetic then the noise. The clean and the noisy
speech seem indistinguishable when seen through the mask.

3.3

The missing data approach to robust speech recognition

The missing data approach to the problem of robust ASR assumes the following:
• local patches in any time–frequency representation of the speech spectrum remain mostly
unaffected by the other sounds even at very poor global SNRs;
• they can be identified with a certain probability;
• there is sufficient quantity of (partial) information in the patches for recognition of the speech
they originated from.
If these assumptions hold, and it is possible to engineer techniques that would produce results
(under these assumptions), one would expect the recogniser to show graceful performance degradation in the cases of occlusion occurring when more then one source is present in the auditory
scene. In that case, the two subproblems involving the application of missing data techniques to
robust ASR are:

• identification of the reliable parts of the spectrum
• recognition using only the reliable parts of the spectrum

3.3.1

Identification of the reliable parts of the speech spectrum

The identification of the reliable parts of the speech spectrum needs to use only the properties of
the speech signal and the physics of sound. We are going to assume some form of time–frequency
representation of the speech features from now on. But any representation preserving the local
properties of the sources would suffice. It has already been noted by several researchers that
features that preserve the localness of the time–frequency plane tend to be more amenable to
noise compensation in unmatched conditions (Holmes and Sedgwick, 1986; Barker, 1998; de Veth
et al., 1999). The separation process may be carried out:
• using only bottom–up constraints, like CASA (Section 4.2) does by using “low–level” features
emerging from the physics of sound; no specific source models are required, but rather a
more general knowledge about what features are bound together because they are likely to
be coming from the same source
• using only top–down constraints in the form of whole source models (e.g. noise model),
maybe additionally paired with some prior knowledge about the nature of the “match” between the models and observations (acoustic back–off and the UNION model, Section 3.5.3)
However, this is an artificial division. Both parts of the process contribute valuable constraints
to the search for the best explanation of the attended source in multi–source environment. There
is no reason not to use a constraint if one is available. Equally, there is no reason to rely on all
constraints being available to do the search.
In the following text, it will be assumed that the above processes will divide the feature vector
x into a reliable (present) and unreliable (missing) component x = (xp , xm ). The distinction is
from the viewpoint of the attended source. If there are two sources, then the present/missing
division for the second source is going to be complementary/opposite to the first one. The process
can be visualised as if a “mask” xm has been placed over the feature vector x allowing us to see
only the present components xp . The mask m determines the separation completely.
Figure 3.1 shows an example of what a mask might look like. The mask is derived for a
mixture of the clean speech (a) (digits string utterance from TIdigits database (Leonard, 1984))
with noise (factory noise from NOISEX database (Varga et al., 1992)) at global SNR of 0dB (b).
The representation is a standard Mel–spectrum filterbank (Young and Woodland, 1993). Panel (c)
depicts the mask. The light blue dots indicate reliable regions1 . Panels (d) and (e) show the clean
and the noisy speech respectively as “seen through” the mask. They are almost indistinguishable.
It would be advantageous if the separation process delivers assessment of how probable is the
proposed mask. It would be even better if it is possible to assess the probability of every possible
mask. That means that there will be a probability P (m) associated with each mask m. Choosing
a single mask (with a probability of unity) is one extreme case of this. The other extreme is failing
to introduce any new constraints in the search and giving equal probability to every possible mask.

3.3.2

Recognition using the reliable parts of the spectrum only

The speech models need to have their probability evaluated with only parts of the observation
vector coming from the source they are modelling. Since there is no prior knowledge which features
are going to be missing, it is reasonable to assume that the models inferred during the training
will have complete feature vectors, and will be adapted to handle the occlusion occurring during
the recognition gracefully and in a principled manner. This requires adaptation of the models on
a frame–by–frame basis. The techniques for implementing the adaptation are:
1 the criterion used for selection was 7.6555 dB local SNR; it was calculated by comparing the clean and the
noisy speech and assuming additivity of the speech and the noise in the power spectral domain

CHAPTER 3. MISSING DATA IN SPEECH PROCESSING

36

• Marginalisation – only the present data xp is used to compute the likelihood of a model W .
The relation between the probability of the “full” data x and the partial present data xp for
a model W is:
Z
p(xp |W ) =
p(xp , xm |W )dxm
(3.1)
Ωxm

The marginal probability p(xp |W ), instead of the “full” probability p(x|W ) is then used in
the subsequent stages of processing.
• Data imputation – the missing data is “filled in” (imputed) using the available knowledge in
the form of the model p(x|W ) and the present data xp . In order to do that, the conditional
distribution of the missing data xm is needed first:
p(xm |xp , W ) =

p(xp , xm |W )
p(xp , xm |W )
=R
p(xp |W )
p(xp , xm |W )dxm
Ωx

(3.2)

m

Then, a single value x̂m from the conditional distribution has to be chosen according to some
criterion and used as a “plug in” replacement for the missing values xm . The choice can be
made by minimising an error criterion. One of the most commonly used error measures is
the mean square error (MSE). In that case, the minimal MSE (MMSE) value for xm is the
conditional expectation:2
Z
x̂m|W = E{xm |xp , W} =
xm p(xm |xp , W)dxm
(3.3)
Ωxm

Depending on the circumstances of application of the technique, other criteria may be used
as well (Chapter 5). Once x̂m is computed, it is used as a plug–in value instead of xm and
the “filled in” feature vector (xm , x̂m ) is used for further processing.
The techniques for handling missing data stem from the statistical techniques for manipulating
probability densities: marginalisation and conditioning. There is an intuitive connection between
them. The marginal distribution p(xp |W ) can be seen as an “average” over all possible conditional
imputations p(xp |xm , W ) weighted by their respective probabilities of occurrence p(xm |W ):
Z
p(xp |W ) =
p(xp |xm , W )p(xm |W )dxm
(3.4)
Ωxm

3.4

Review of pattern matching methods for missing data

Normally for the purposes of speech recognition it will be assumed that the full (clean) data is
available during the models training (parameter estimation). However, techniques for learning or
model parameters estimation from incomplete data give insight into the possibilities for handling
the missing data condition in principled way.
Little and Rubin (1997) formalised the missing data mechanism as two coupled statistical
processes, one generating a feature vectors X and another one generating masks M that determine
which parts of X are present/missing. Their the joint distribution is:
p(X, M |θ, φ) = p(M |X, φ)p(X|θ)

(3.5)

where θ are the parameters of the production process and φ are the parameters of the censoring
process. Then, the following observations about the nature of the missing data mechanism can be
made (Gelman et al., 1995; Ghahramani and Jordan, 1994b):
R
p(x) the expectation
E{x} = xp(x)dx is a value that minimises the
R
2
2
mean square error MSE; ex: M SE = E{(x − m) } = (x − m)
R p(x)dx where m is the unknown value; setting the
first derivative of the MSE with respect to m to 0 gives m = xp(x)dx i.e. m = E{x}
2 for any random variable x with p.d.f.

CHAPTER 3. MISSING DATA IN SPEECH PROCESSING

37

(a) The mask M is independent of the data X. The missing data is said to be missing completely
at random (MCAR): p(M |X, φ) = p(M |φ)
(b) The mask M depends on the present data Xp but not on the missing data Xm . The missing
data is said to be missing at random (MAR): p(M |X, φ) = p(M |Xp , Xm , φ) = p(M |Xp , φ)
(c) The mask M depends both on the present data Xp and on the missing data Xm . The missing
data is said not to be missing at random (NMAR): p(M |X, φ) = p(M |Xp , Xm , φ). This is
sometimes referred to as a data “censoring”.
In the case of robust ASR, Xp is the speech, and Xm is the noise observations. CASA (and
other bottom–up techniques for speech estimation from noisy speech) assume that the mask M
can be determined using the speech observations Xp only, and independent of the noise Xm .
Therefore they assume the MAR model (case (b)) of censoring. Techniques that rely on both the
(estimated) speech and noise in order to derive the mask (e.g. noise estimation for the purposes of
SNR estimation for mask estimation) need both Xp and Xm to derive M . Therefore they assume
the NMAR model (case (c)) of censoring.
The learning process is a search for parameters θ and φ that maximise the probability of the
observed (present) data Xp and the mask M . The maximum likelihood (ML) methods maximise
the likelihood:
L(θ, φ|Xp , M ) ∝ P (Xp , M |θ, φ)
(3.6)
The maximum a posteriori (MAP) based methods maximise the a posteriori probability:
P (θ, φ|Xp , M ) ∝ P (Xp , M |θ, φ)P (θ, φ)

(3.7)

In both cases, the common factor:
Z
P (Xp , M |θ, φ) =

P (M |Xp , Xm , φ)P (Xp , Xm |θ)dXm

(3.8)

contains the expression P (M |Xp , Xm , φ). In the cases of MCAR and MAR this expression is
independent of Xm so at least it is P (M |Xp , Xm , φ) = P (M |Xp , φ) (in the MCAR case even
P (M |Xp , Xm , φ) = P (M |φ)). So P (M |Xp , Xm , φ) can be moved out of the integral giving:
P (Xp , M |θ, φ) = P (M |Xp , φ)P (Xp |θ)

(3.9)

The last equation is important as it allows to ignore the missing data mechanism if all that is
needed is estimation of θ (the parameters that define the process generating the data). The θ that
maximises L(θ|Xp ) ∝ P (Xp |θ) will also maximise L(θ, φ|Xp , M ).
The MAP estimator has an additional factor P (θ, φ) that connects the parameters of the data
generating and the data masking process. One way around this is to assume that it is factorisable
P (θ, φ) = P (θ)P (φ). Then the data generating process parameters θ can be estimated without
the need to estimate the masking process parameters φ.
Both ML and MAP can not ignore the data masking process in the NMAR case. Its parameters
φ have to be estimated as well.

3.4.1

Parameters estimation with missing data for mixture models

We will consider mixture models in connection with the density based approach to learning (Ghahramani and Jordan, 1994a). Both are commonly used in the speech recognition statistical systems.
The mixture model assumes the data was generated independently from a mixture of densities:
X
P (x) =
P (x|k, θk )P (k)
(3.10)
k

where the components denoted by k have the parameters θk . The density based approach to
learning estimates the joint density of the present and the missing data (and all variables, in fact)

CHAPTER 3. MISSING DATA IN SPEECH PROCESSING

38

as a first step3 . All other relations of interest between any of the variables are derived from the
joint density via conditioning and marginalisation. For example, the regression is the expectation
over the conditional density.
The Expectation–Maximisation (EM) algorithm is usually the algorithm of choice for maximising the probability for the complete data (Dempster et al., 1977). For a given set if samples
X = {xi }, the log–likelihood L (since the logarithm is a monotonic function, θ that maximises it
maximises the likelihood, too) is:
X
X
L(θ|X) =
log(
P (xi |k, θk )P (k))
(3.11)
i

k

where L(θ|X) = log p(X|θ) is the log–likelihood of the model parameters θ given the data X =
{xi }.
The original EM–algorithm itself introduces a “hidden” indicator variable Z = {zik } that is 1
if and only if the vector xi is generated by the mixture component k, and 0 otherwise. Then the
“complete” log–likelihood L becomes:
XX
Lc (θ|X) =
zik log(P (xi |zi , θ)P (zi , θ))
(3.12)
i

k

The variable zik is itself missing data, since it can not be observed directly. The EM–algorithm
states that L(θ|X) can be maximised by iteratively alternating the following two steps:
Q(θ|θ(n) ) = E{Lc (θ|X, Z)|X, θ(n) } (E-step)
θ(n+1) = argmaxQ(θ|θ(n) ) (M-step)

(3.13)

θ

where (n) and (n + 1) denote two subsequent steps in the iteration. The extension when part of
the data is missing is natural. The only difference is that the expectation in the E–step is taken
with respect to the present (not the complete) data, in addition to the indicator variables Z.

where N is the number of data vectors X = {xi }i=1...N .
In the case of missing data, it is not only the indicator variables that are missing, but parts
of the data xi as well. We will introduce the notation µp,k and µm,k to denote parts of the mean
vector of Gaussian k belonging to the present and missing components, and Σpp,k , Σpm,k , Σmp,k
and Σmm,k to denote parts of the covariance matrix of the Gaussian k with covariances between
the present–present, present–missing, missing–present and missing–missing features. Similarly xp,i
and xm,i denotes the present and missing components respectively of a feature vector xi . The
log–likelihood in that case is:

Ignoring the second term (since only P (xi |zi , θ) is of interest to us), and decomposing the Gaussians

P (k|xp,i )(n+1) (µm,k + Σmp,k Σ−1

(3.23)

Similarly, the third term of Eq. (3.21) yields E{zik xm,i xTm,i |xp,i θ(n) } which can be computed as:
T
T
E{zik xm,i xTm,i |xp,i θ(n) } = P (k|xp,i )(n+1) (Σmm,k − Σmp,k Σ−1

(3.24)

where x̂m,i,k = µm,k + Σmp,k Σ−1
pp,k (xp,i − µp,k ) is the regression (expectation) of the missing given
the present data for k-th Gaussian (used in Eq. (3.23), too). Once these terms are computed, the
update formulae for the parameters of the model can be found the same way as in the complete
data case.
Ghahramani and Jordan (1994a) also consider the case of EM for discrete variables with
incomplete data.

3.4.2

Classification with missing data

Although the classification is just a special case of function approximation with the data vector
elements divided into “inputs” and “outputs” and where the outputs are discrete variables (in
most cases), it warrants special attention. There are hybrid speech recognition systems where as
part of the process evaluation of the posterior probability of a class given the data is needed.
Classification with mixture models
Mixture models can handle classification with missing data naturally. Once the joint density of
the data and the class labels P (x, C = j|θ) is known, every relation between them can be derived
readily. Most often the posterior probability P (C = j|x, θ) is sought. One example for the joint

CHAPTER 3. MISSING DATA IN SPEECH PROCESSING

data – class labels density P (x, C = j|θ) is a mixture of type (Ghahramani and Jordan, 1994a;
Tresp et al., 1994):
X
wjk πk N (x; µk , Σk )
(3.25)
P (x, C = j|θ) =

with Gaussian and multinomial components. If part of the vector xi is missing, then the E–step
of the EM algorithm is:
(n) (n)

P (k|xp,i , Ci = j)(n+1) = P

(n)

(n)

wjk πk N (xp,i ; µp,k , Σpp,k )

(n) (n)
(n)
(n)
k0 wjk0 wk0 N (xp,i ; µp,k0 , Σpp,k0 )

(3.26)

(n)

If the class label Ci is unknown then wjk factors vanish from the denominator and the numerator
and the E–step is the same
Pas for a Gaussian mixtures, Eq. (3.22). Then in the M–step the class
label’s j–th component is k P (k|xp,i , Ci = j)(n+1) wjk . The rest of the M–step is the same as at
the Gaussian mixture model.
Somewhere in between the mixture model Eq. (3.25) and the feedforward networks discussed
in the next subsection are the two layer radial bases functions (RBF) networks with Gaussian
kernels (Bishop, 1995), used by Tresp et al. (1994) to classify with missing data. Each output yi
of the network is computed as:
P
k wkj πk N (x; µk , Σk )
yj (x) = P
(3.27)
k πk N (x; µk , Σk )
With suitable (unsupervised) training the network kernels in the first layer will estimate the data
density–the denominator in the equation above. Similarly, the second layer will estimate the joint
density of the data and the classes. It is then possible to compute the class posterior probability
given a data vector P (Cj |xp ) needed for a forward pass when parts of the feature vector are
missing (Ahmad and Tresp, 1993):
RP
k wkj πk N (x; µk , Σk )dxm
RP
P (Cj |xp ) =
k πk N (x; µk , Σk )dxm
P
w
k kj πk N (xp ; µp,k , Σpp,k )
P
= yj (xp )
(3.28)
=
k πk N (xp ; µp,k , Σpp,k )
Radial basis Boltzmann machines are another class of networks that share the property of input data density estimation as part of the training process. Consequently, this special type of
Boltzmann machine can handle missing data in their inputs naturally and have been used for
classification with missing data (Kappen and Nijman, 1995).
Classification with feedforward networks
Many feedforward networks have 1–of–N coding of the targets and are trained to minimise a
quadratic error function. Richard and Lippmann (1991) have shown that in that case each output
of the network yi estimates the posterior probability P (Ci |x) that the vector x comes from class
Ci . We will consider the case when part of the input is missing only. It will be assumed that
the class labels are always present. When part of the input is missing, the posterior probability
P (C|xp ) of the class C given the present data xp is (Ahmad and Tresp, 1993; Bishop, 1995):
Z
P (C|xp ) = P (C|x)p(xm |xp )dxm
(3.29)
Intuitively, the form states that the estimate of the posterior on the basis present data P (C|xp )
is the average of the full data posterior P (C|x) over all possible completions of the missing values
xm , weighted by the probability that xm could occur, given the present data xp . I.e. it is the
expected conditional posterior given the present data Exm |xp {P (C|x)}.

CHAPTER 3. MISSING DATA IN SPEECH PROCESSING

41

The j–th network output N Nj (x) estimates the class conditional density of the j–th class
N Nj (x) ≈ P (Cj |x) only. So the data density p(x) remains unknown. One solution to the problem
is to estimate the data density separately (Tresp et al., 1995). For example, the input distribution
can be approximated using Parzen windows (Duda and Hart, 1973):
P (x) =

1 X
N (x; xi , σ)
N i

(3.30)

where
P {xi } for i = 1 . . . N is the training data and σ is fixed. It is also obvious that P (xp ) =
1
i N (xp ; xp,i , σ). Then, the missing data integral Eq. (3.29) becomes:
N
Z
1
1 X
P (Cj |xp ) = 1 P
N Nj (x)[
N (x; xi , σ)]dxm ,
N i
i N (xp ; xp,i , σ)
N
(3.31)
where x = (xp , xm ) is a test data vector that is to be classified and has the xm components
missing.
Assuming that the network prediction is constant over the “width” of the Gaussians, the
N Nj (x) comes out of the integral (as a constant) and the integral cancels out the missing data
dimensions of N (x; xi , σ) reducing it to N (xp ; xp,i , σ):
P
N Nj (xp , xm,i )N (xp ; xp,i , σ)
P
P (Cj |xp ) ≈ i
(3.32)
i N (xp ; xp,i , σ)
The expression N Nj (xp , xm,i ) means that this is the output of the network obtained feeding the
present components of the observation data vector and missing components from the i–th training
pattern. Therefore, in order to evaluate the missing data integral for a single input, a sum over all
patterns from the training set has to be computed. This is nearly impossible to apply to a hybrid
speech recognition system, since the number of training examples is very large. Instead, some form
of clustering or semiparametric density estimation (e.g. Gaussians mixture) of the data density
in the training set maybe employed. Then, instead of using the complete training set during the
recognition, centroids of the clusters (means of the mixtures) will be used in the sum in Eq. (3.32).
Raj et al. (1998) and Dupont (1998) used this approach.
If minimal assumptions only are to be made about the data density p(x), then a closed form
Eq. (B.14) (Appendix B) can be used to estimate the outputs of a single layer network with
sigmoid transfer function. However, the assumption that an observation o makes all xm in the
interval [0, om ] equally probable is clearly geared toward application in speech recognition with a
certain type of features x. As in our experiments no hybrid ASR system was used, this line of
enquiry was not followed through.
Learning from incomplete data

where φ denotes the parameters of the data density. Taking into account Eq. (3.29), the gradient

where ti is the desired output of the network for the data vector xi (which belongs to class Ci ).
The integral has no close form solution and has to be approximated by a Monte Carlo simulation.
The missing data components are drawn from the (known) input data distribution and then the
integral is calculated.
Recurrent networks
Bengio and Gingras (1996) used recurrent networks with feedback for classification with missing
data. In the “static version”, network’s unknown inputs are initialised with their unconditional
mean, and their value is then updated by feedback links with delays, just as if these were hidden
units. The network enters an oscillatory regime, effectively searching for the output giving minimal
error (as measured by the error function) and imputing the “missing” hidden units in the process.
On a small dataset, a learning algorithm using error backpropagation tested favourably compared
to mixture model learning.

3.4.3

Missing data imputation for regression

The problem of regression (conditional average) E{y|x} is one commonly encountered in statistical
analysis. When some of the input data x is missing, one way to proceed with the regression
analysis is to impute the missing values (Little, 1992). The simplest method is to impute the
missing components by their unconditional sample means,4 computed from the data where these
components are present. An improvement over this is to impute the missing values from a linear
regression estimated between the missing and the present components in the complete data (the
conditional mean). When x and y are highly correlated, then even better imputations may be
obtained by using y in addition to the present components of the data to compute the regression.
However, the estimate obtained is biased and corrections need to be applied. The standard
formulae for computing the errors on the complete data will not take into account the errors of
the imputation. Multiple imputation (Rubin, 1987) is one solution to this problem. Instead of a
single imputation, the data set is divided into subsets and multiple imputations are calculated.
They are all in turn imputed and the complete data analysis is carried out giving multiple sets of
regression parameters. The final parameters are their average.

3.5

Missing data for speech recognition: A review

The missing data approach has already been utilised for ASR. Cooke, Green, Anderson, and Abberley (1994b) reported on early experiments with application in speech recognition. A method
for adapting a conventional Hidden Markov model (HMM) based ASR system5 was developed
which allows adaptation of the recogniser to an arbitrary pattern of occlusion in the observations.
The method employed marginalisation of the missing features, and the state emission probability
is calculated as p(xp |S). It was shown that the adaptation to the recogniser because of marginalisation is simple – it essentially boils down to parameter selection of the state p.d.f.s Gaussians
in the known dimensions.6 The training of the recogniser was on clean speech. The experiments
were performed with HTK toolkit (Young and Woodland, 1993) on a TIMIT database (Garofolo
and Pallet, 1989) with random occlusions (missing data) on proportions from 0 to 90%. Graceful
degradation of performance was reported. Only after 60% of features were deleted, significant
degradation did occur. The new method was compared to unconditional mean imputation and
clearly performed much better. In the discussion, a CASA (Section 4.2) system was envisaged as a
preprocessor for separation. It was also noted that adapted HMM models can act in the separation
4 sometimes mere zeros are imputed, especially if the data is “preprocessed” to zero mean and unit variance
5 Contemporary speech recognition systems fall into two broad categories: HMM based (Rabiner and Juang, 1993)
and hybrid systems (Bourlard and Morgan, 1993). In the further discussion we will
Passume an HMM system with
emission probability p(x|S) modelled as a mixture of diagonal Gaussians p(x|S) = k P (k|S)p(xp |k, S)p(xm |k, S),
unless stated otherwise.

process like “schemas”. The motivation comes from the evidence to suggest that in ASA there
is flow of information from the top to the bottom (in addition to bottom–up processing), in a
coupled and self–reinforcing manner (Bregman, 1990).
The idea of using missing data for recognition of speech was extended further by introducing
training with randomly deleted (missing) data (Cooke et al., 1994c). A self–organising, topology
preserving Kohonen network was used for the experiments with a modified learning algorithms
which takes into account only the present components of the feature vector. The experiments
used PLP and ratemap(Cooke, 1991) representation and occluded data both during training and
recognition on a subset of the TIMIT database. There is little degradation for up to 50% deletions,
with the ratemap representation outperforming PLP, especially at deletions of more then 50% of
the data. It was speculated that this is because of the correlations between the features in the
ratemap vector.7 It was also noted that a further constraint can be utilised: the (observed) total
energy of the mixture implies that none of the components has greater energy then this.
This idea was further developed in (Cooke et al., 1994a). The motivation comes from auditory
experiments showing that perception of a particular sound can “fill in” gaps in the evidence, provided that there isn’t evidence against. This is termed “auditory induction” (Warren et al., 1994)
and experiments have shown that people are not aware of gaps in the sounds if there is sufficient
energy to allow the possibility of a particular sound (the “phoneme restoration” effect (Warren,
1970)). As a Kohonen net was used for classification, the “auditory induction” was implemented
by giving less weight to the hypothesis that expect more energy then the total energy of the mixture of sounds at a particular place. The improvement was notable at high percentages of data
deletions. Experiments on correlated deletions ware also carried out, as better approximation to
CASA. The relative importance of spectral peaks over the spectral valleys was noted for robustness: an ASR system relying on information in spectral valleys will not be robust as they “fill”
with noise first (see Section 2.7.7). It was also found that even for clean speech using the peaks
only (instead of the full spectrum) improves recognition. It can be speculated that this may be
for two reasons:
• lessening the sensitivity to F0 which is speaker dependent and hinders the ASR performance
• peaks are less correlated which makes modelling the speech with diagonal covariance matrices
in the Gaussians more realistic
Green et al. (1995) reported on incorporating the “auditory induction” idea in an HMM based
ASR system originally used in (Cooke et al., 1994b). The state emission probability was computed
as:
Z om
X
P (k|S)p(xp |k, S)
p(xm |k, S)dxm
(3.35)
k

−∞

Further, instead of a random deletion pattern, single and triple digits mixed with babble noise,
both from the NOISEX database (Varga et al., 1992) were used. In order to assess the potential
of the technique with realistic noise, but without available CASA system, the present features
were found by comparison of the noisy with the clean speech. We will refer to the masks derived
this way as an a–priori masks (panel (c) of Figure 3.1). The comparison gives the local SNR in a
particular time–frequency point, as opposed to the global SNR, which is an average computed over
the whole utterance. The local SNR was thresholded at values ranging from -10dB to 10dB and
time–frequency points with local SNR below the threshold were considered missing. Comparisons
of the simulated ASR system with 0dB threshold with listeners performance on the same task
gave curves parallel to each other. However, listeners perform with virtually no degradation until
0dB global SNR, and fall off to the levels of chance only at global SNR of -15dB.
Several missing data imputation schemes for adapting the HMM recogniser (in addition to
Eq. (3.35)) coupled with different deletion patterns were reported in (Cooke et al., 1996). The
missing data imputation x̂m was performed as:
• unconditional mean imputation x̂m = µm
7 the PLP features are much more independent in the feature vector

CHAPTER 3. MISSING DATA IN SPEECH PROCESSING

44

• conditional mean imputation x̂m = µm + ΣTpm Σ−1
pp (xp − µp )
• conditional mean imputation together with conditional variance to weigh the distribution
spread
The experiments were carried out on a Resource management (RM) task (Price et al., 1988). It
was found that performance of the missing data techniques degrades with “large block” across
time and frequency deletions. This is also the case with deletions derived from the a–priori mask.
Investigation showed that there are frames where no information at all is available across the whole
spectrum. The covariance weighting giving more weight to the states in the frames depending on
the amount of available data was also tested. The above techniques, as well as other issues like data
orthogonalisation were discussed in more details in (Morris et al., 1998). Using context dependent
models with tying, tests were carried out on the same RM task with feature vectors complemented
with first and second order differences. The spectral peaks were again found to be advantageous.

3.5.1

Relation to the MAX model of speech and noise combination

It has been already noted by several researchers that assigning the energy in the mixture to one
of the sources only is a viable approximation and also significantly eases the computations (Nadas
et al., 1989; Varga and Moore, 1991; Kadirkamanathan, 1992; Rose et al., 1994). As seen on
Figure 3.2, the more energetic speech features “peak” over the noise, while the less energetic ones
gradually submerge under the noise as the global SNR increases.
The MAX environment model (Nadas et al., 1989) models the resulting noisy speech x as:
x = max(s, n)

(3.36)

Assuming noise and speech independence, for the cumulative probability PX (x) of the mixture8
we have:
PX (x)

= P rob{X ≤ x} = P rob{S ≤ x, N ≤ x}
= P rob{S ≤ x}P rob{N ≤ x} = PS (x)PN (x)

(3.37)

After taking the derivative with respect to x, the density of X is expressed as:
pX (x) = pS (x)PN (x) + PS (x)pN (x)

(3.38)

Once this relation is known, and assuming certain parametric models for the speech and the
noise, the parameters of the models can be derived from the noisy data. The EM for mixtures
(Section 3.4.1) was used in (Nadas et al., 1989; Rose et al., 1994) to compute the reestimation
formulae for speech modelled with Gaussian mixture model and noise modelled with single Gaussian. The formulae essentially express the intuition that the information content of the signals
below the noise is low and they should be given less weight when updates are calculated. HMM
decomposition (Varga and Moore, 1991) (Section 2.8.2) can be used to deal with multistate noise
models.
The missing data approach effectively utilises a MAX environmental model. However, it is
assumed that no prior noise model
R x will be available. Then Eq. (3.38) degenerates to pS (x) when
the feature x is present, and 1/x 0 pS (u)du when it is missing. In the latter case, noise is assumed
to be uniformly distributed between 0 and x.

3.5.2

Relation to noise masking

Holmes and Sedgwick (1986) modelled the masking of speech by noise (Section 2.6.3) similarly. The
noise process has a fixed threshold value known in advance. Then, the masked features contribute
PS (x) to the probability (x is the observed value), while the unmasked features contribute pS (x).
8 in this section only the random variables will be marked by capital letters, their realisations with small letters;

Training with noisy speech is possible, as well. The mask value for each channel B is the
highest noise value found in the training data for that channel. If the fraction of masked features
for a channel is F , and µ0 is the sample mean of the unmasked samples, then the mean µ and
variance σ 2 are:

where Q(x) = N (erf −1 (x), 0, 1).
Similarly to noise masking, Brendborg and Lindberg (1997) investigated two approaches to
robustness in the context of a HMM system:
• mean value masking – Gaussians that have means smaller then a threshold were considered
sensitive to noise and prevented from scoring very low probability scores
• dimensionality reduction – Gaussians with means smaller then a threshold were ignored
The second technique was reported to give better results. It is equivalent to putting a default
missing data mask to every Gaussian in the mixture. The first technique is motivated by similar

CHAPTER 3. MISSING DATA IN SPEECH PROCESSING

46

concerns as the techniques from the next Section: preventing extremely low scores for outliers in
the distribution caused by points dominated by noise (and therefore not drawn from the speech
distribution). For sonorant sounds, results similar to PMC without utilising explicit noise model
were reported.

3.5.3

Missing feature compensation based on the acoustic evidence

If a state p.d.f. scores very low for a particular observation, all paths passing through that state
will have their scores depressed to the extent that it is unlikely that any of them will win. This
is because the overall probability of a model is product of the probabilities in each frame. An
extremely low probability at some frame effectively discards the model, regardless of strength of
the previous or subsequent acoustic evidence. Several factors contribute to this:
• the Gaussian p.d.f. used for state emission probability modelling have very “slim” tails–they
quickly fall–off when moving away from their mean
• in the noisy speech, the unreliable (missing) features are not generated by the speech source,
but by the noise source; so they may fall on the tail of the speech p.d.f.
• the Gaussians in the mixture are usually diagonal, the features are independent and the final
score is a product of the individual features scores; a feature lying on the tails of several
Gaussians and scoring very low diminishes the discrimination between the states, regardless
of the evidence from the other features
Two techniques have emerged to address this problem: acoustic back–off and the UNION model.
Acoustic back–off
de Veth, Cranen, and Boves (1998) devised an acoustic back–off scheme in order to control the
damage: the state distribution is bounded by how low it can score. There is a certain analogy
with multigram language models, where a certain probability mass is reserved for the tuples never
seen in the training data.9 There is also a connection with the well known problem of “outliers” in
statistics: the problem occurring when the data sample from which the distributions are inferred is
not representative enough. Therefore, points that were very rare in the training sample will score
very low probabilities. Difference of many orders of magnitude between the “regular” points and
“outliers’ in the data space may be a poor model of the real process. Reserving certain probability
mass for low–frequency points (and thus establishing a lower bound for the probability of the
“outlier”) is one common technique. So the “backed–off” state p.d.f. p‘(x|S) is:
p0 (x|S) = αp(x|S) + (1 − α)p0

(3.40)

Experimental results in (de Veth et al., 1998) indicate improved robustness when tested with
artificially induced “disturbance” of the features.
The UNION model
The union model (Ming and Smith, 2000; Ming et al., 1999) originates from attempts to merge
the partial evidence in the context of multiband/multistream speech recognition system (Bourlard
et al., 1996; Tibrewala and Hermansky, 1998). As mentioned above, the acoustic scores in the
present systems are multiplied together loosing the discriminability between the models when there
is an outlier. Assuming feature independence, in the UNION model the probability of observing
x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xn ) is given by the recurrent relation:
n−1
P (x) = P (∨ni=1 xi ) = P (∨n−1
i=1 xi ) + P (xn ) − P (∨i=1 xi )P (xn )

(3.41)

9 assigning probability zero to the unseen tuples would rule out any possibility of recognition, regardless how
good the acoustic evidence for recognition is

CHAPTER 3. MISSING DATA IN SPEECH PROCESSING

47

where P (∨ni=1 xi ) = P (x1 ∨ x2 ∨ . . . ∨ xn ) or equivalently:
P (x) = 1 −

n
Y

(1 − P (xi ))

(3.42)

i=1

If the feature x is a spectral frame (and the individual features are the frequency bands), then this
is the “product of error rule”: the probability of error is product of the probabilities of error in
all frequency bands (Allen, 1994). In this form, the aim of the method is straightforward: when
xi is an outlier and scores extremely low acoustic score, 1 − P (xi ) ≈ 1 and it doesn’t disturb the
overall acoustic score. While the back-off tries to limit the damage done by the low scores, the
union model uses the low scores to its advantage.
It was noted that grouping each band separately greatly damages the discriminability. So
groups of bands are combined with the ∧ operator between them (thus accumulating the discriminability), and with the ∨ operator between them. This is the segment–based UNION model.
However, both back–off and the UNION model do not add any new constraints in the recognition search. They can not handle the case when some noise patch matches some speech model
relatively well and therefore can not be discounted by its acoustic score.

3.5.4

Missing data imputation

Missing data may be reconstructed independently of the speech recogniser. Once reconstructed,
the complete data can be fed to the recogniser which need not change at all. This approach is
very attractive, and it has already been used (Section 2.6) for speech enhancement. The difference
is that the same techniques that are largely used for recognition (like clustering and modelling
the data distributions as Gaussian mixtures) are now utilised for reconstruction of the missing
features.
(Raj et al., 1998) clustered the input data, and the cluster with maximum score for the present
data was used for filling in the missing values. In the second technique, the correlations across
time between the missing features and the most highly correlated present features were used
in the data imputation process. Dupont (1998) used the data imputation as a preprocessor to a
hybrid HMM/ANN system. The separation was carried out via thresholding of the estimated SNR
(assuming additive noise model). The data distribution was estimated separately with Gaussians
mixture model (GMM). Then, the missing features were compensated by imputing the conditional
mean.
Renevey and Drygajlo (2000b,a) integrated together feature separation, spectral subtraction,
PMC
compensation and data imputation. The data p.d.f. was estimated with diagonal GMM
P
P
(k)N
(x, µ, σ 2 ; k) independently of the recogniser. Under the additive noise assumption, an
k
on–line noise estimation was carried out and the noise p.d.f. was computed. The distribution
of the noise was assumed to be Gaussian. Then, the probability of each channel being noisy
can be computed for a given observation. By thresholding, the features are separated on present
(probability that noise in that channel is greater then the threshold) or missing (probability that
noise in that channel is smaller then the threshold). The data GMM model was first compensated
with PMC (Eq. (2.23)) using the running noise model estimate. Next, the responsibilities of the
compensated GMM were calculated:
2
P (k)N (x; µpmc , σpmc
; k)
0
2
0
k0 P (k )N (x; µpmc , σpmc ; k )

P (kpmc |x) = P

(3.43)

Then in (Renevey and Drygajlo, 2000b) the missing features were compensated by imputing the
expected value of the compensated conditional distribution:
X
P (kpmc |xp )µm,k
(3.44)
x̂m = Exm |xp {xm } =
k

The present features xp were compensated with spectral subtraction.

CHAPTER 3. MISSING DATA IN SPEECH PROCESSING

48

In (Renevey and Drygajlo, 2000a) instead of dividing the features on present and missing from
the onset and compensating them separately, the probability that a channel is noisy Ψ(x) was
used as a “soft” measure between the conditional mean of the compensated GMM and the noisy
observation:
X
x̂m = [1 − Ψ(x)]Exm |xp {xm } + Ψ(x)x = [1 − Ψ(x)]
P (kpmc |xp )µm,k + Ψ(x)x
(3.45)
k

The techniques showed an improvement over the baseline on the task of recognition digit strings
from TIdigits database (Leonard, 1984) mixed with noise from NOISEX-92 database (Varga et al.,
1992).
Park and Kim (2000) reported on data imputation from a GMM model of the wideband speech
for narrowband (telephone) to wideband speech enhancement.

3.5.5

Stochastic features

Several researchers have noted that if a measure of the feature reliability is available, then it
is desirable to integrate over the domain of the unreliable feature, weighting the integral with
the reliability measure. In the extreme, if the variance of the feature is infinite, the technique
degenerates into marginalisation.
Garner and Holmes (1998) used this idea to incorporate formant features into a conventional
HMM–based ASR system. Both the estimate of the reliability of the tracker and the formant
features were rigorously incorporated in the HMM model.
Similarly, the unreliability of the features after spectral subtraction was used to weight the
evidence during the Viterbi search in an HMM system and during the dynamic programming (DP)
search in a dynamic time warping (DTW) ASR system (Yoma et al., 1998). nad H. Pao et al.
(1998) named those features “stochastic features”, and again used their variance as a weighting
factor along the integration path.

3.5.6

Missing data combined with other techniques

The missing data approach has been combined naturally with several other techniques for robust
ASR on a speaker verification task (El-Maliki, 2000). It was also used to deal in a principled way
with the “negative spectrum” problem arising in spectral subtraction. The features where the noise
estimation failed can be considered missing and marginalised (Drygajlo and El-Maliki, 1998a).
Similarly, it naturally combines with PMC: only the missing features need to be compensated
with PMC (Renevey and Drygajlo, 1999). Compared to “plain” PMC, an improvement on the
ASR task of digit strings recognition in noise was reported at all SNRs and for all tested noises.
(Drygajlo and El-Maliki, 1998b,c) used a missing data based system, together with non–linear
and adaptive generalised SS and MMSE spectral amplitude estimator for detection of the missing
features (El-Maliki and Drygajlo, 1999) for robust speaker verification. Padmanabhan and Picheny
(2000) utilised the idea of missing data within a multiscale graphical model designed to address
several shortcomings of the current systems. Droppo et al. (2002) learnt a separate conditional
distribution p(noisy|clean) for different SNRs and noises (from noisy data) and then used the
conditional average of the state likelihood (inferred from clean data) during the decoding.

3.5.7

Missing data in speech perception modelling

A missing data recogniser was used to model the perception of severely spectrally reduced sine–
wave speech (Barker and Cooke, 1997; Barker, 1998). The sine–wave speech represents the natural
speech by a small number time varying sinusoids (somewhat similar to formant synthesis). It is a
crude approximation of the natural speech, and yet it remains intelligible.10 Since it is a greatly
reduced representation, sine–wave speech was posed as a challenge to the bottom–up grouping on
10 with some training on the part of the listeners

the basis of primitive features in the speech (Remez et al., 1994). (Barker, 1998) used a missing
data recogniser to recognise sine–wave speech successfully with models trained on clean speech.
Spectral peaks were used as features for recognition. During the recognition, spectral peak xi,t
was identified in channel i at time frame t, according to:
(
1 if xi,t > xi,t−1 and xi,t > xi,t+1
peak(i, t) =
(3.46)
0 otherwise
The features in the peak positions were used for recognition, while the rest of the features in
the vector were marginalised. A small improvement was also noted with models trained on the
peaks from the clean speech with Viterbi training, despite the data sparseness (only a small
fraction of the data are spectral peaks) compared to the “whole spectrum” models. Since the
features used (64–channel ratemap) have fine frequency resolution and resolve the harmonics of
the fundamental, selecting the spectral peaks effectively amounts to spectrum sampling at the
multiples of the fundamental frequency F0 – similarly to the double vowel identification model
below.
Experiments with low and high–pass filtering showed a gradual decrease in the performance
for missing data based recogniser similar to one observed with humans (Lippmann and Carlson,
1997) (Figures (3.3) and (3.4)). Provided that:
• the missing bands are known in advance, and the models are adapted correspondingly (in
this case a low and high frequency filter were used, with known cut–off frequencies),
• there is no contextual information which humans can make use of, and machines can not (in
this case nonsense CVC syllables ware used),
Under these conditions, the curves of performance decrease for humans and missing data based
recogniser are parallel in shape. It should be taken into account that the human performance is for
much harder task of nonsense syllables recognition, while machine recognition is for digits recognition task (perplexity of 6900 vs. 10). The recogniser used marginalisation without additional
constraints. The identity of the missing features was known a–priori.
A joint psychophysical and modelling study assessing the intelligibility of band–pass filtered
speech for humans and a missing data recogniser (Cunningham and Cooke, 1999) indicated that:

CHAPTER 3. MISSING DATA IN SPEECH PROCESSING

50

• The intelligibility of the speech filtered through gammatone bandpass filters with centre
frequencies in the 1-3kHz range remains high.
• The performance increases further when noise (up to a certain level) is added to an appropriately selected bands. It was speculated that the added noise acts as a counter–evidence
explaining the spectral restoration effect.
• a missing data recogniser employed on the same task (the mask was known in advance)
showed a pattern of performance similar to the humans, although at much lower level. The
performance rose as the number of channels increased. However, for the higher channels the
gap remained much larger then for the lower channels, indicating a deficiency in the feature
extraction at the higher channels. Using the auditory induction constrained didn’t improve
the results for the recogniser. A gap in the performance at 750Hz was notable both with
human listeners and the missing data recogniser.
de Cheveigne and Kawahara (1999) constructed a missing data based model of vowel identification. On a simple task of identification of five synthetic vowels,11 relying on the shape of short
term smoothed spectrum12 was found lacking. With increase of F0 , the effects due to truncation and aliasing could not be ignored, and adversely affected the distance measure between the
template Ti and the target example T . A missing data model where the short term spectrum
was sampled at multiples of estimated F̂0 and matched against the template at these points only,
was found to be resistant to increases in F0 . The new distance measure was implemented as a
weighting function W (f ) to the squared spectral distance D(T, Ti ):

(3.47)

A fundamental frequency tracker is needed for F0 estimation. It was discussed that if it can
estimate the p.d.f. of the F0 13 instead of a single value, it would provide natural adaptation when
F0 can not be estimated or is unlikely to be estimated well.

3.6

Summary

In this chapter the idea that parts of the speech spectrum may be obscured by sounds from other
sources in a multisource acoustic environment and thus effectively removed from the recognition
process was introduced. It is termed missing data, or missing features in speech. Arguments
supporting the idea, coming from observations of how humans handle natural auditory scenes,
experiments on humans with artificial stimuli, physiological evidence from various levels in the
auditory chain and arguments from a signal processing perspective were put forward. On this
basis, the missing data approach to robust ASR was formulated. It envisages that the recognition
should be performed in two distinct steps:
• identification and grouping of the evidence coming from the speech source of interest
• adaptation of the recogniser, and recognition of the partial speech
It was speculated that the approach should be adaptable and robust to various speech degradations.
Next, the techniques for pattern classification (training and recognition) were reviewed. They
can be systematised into two broad classes:
11 well separable in the F 1 − F 2 plane
12 derived by Fourier transform of the spectrum, truncation of the coefficients above 2F
0

and inverse Fourier
transform

51

• techniques relying on marginalisation of the missing data
• techniques using the knowledge of the present data to impute estimates of the missing data
Some pattern classifiers (typically those estimating the data p.d.f. as part of the learning process)
are more amenable to adaptation for handling missing data then the others (typically estimating
the conditional densities only, not the joint density between the data and the classes).
In the last section previous missing data studies in connection with speech and speaker recognition and speech perception were reviewed. Relations to other models for achieving robustness
were also highlighted, and the ways of combining the missing data approach with other techniques
for robust ASR was discussed.

Chapter 4

Missing data identification
4.1

Introduction

The first task in the proposed missing data based robust ASR system is to identify (with a certain
degree of confidence) the reliable regions of features on which the recognition is going to be based.
The way humans do this seems to be by auditory scene analysis (ASA) (Bregman, 1990),
utilising principles (prior knowledge) reaching back to the physics of sound. Computational ASA
(CASA) (Brown and Cooke, 1994) tries to devise models for separation of the speech from the
mixture of sounds in a similar manner to ASA. The techniques will be discussed in the next section.
Sound sources are physically independent entities and therefore the corresponding signals in
the mixture will be independent by default.1 With loose assumptions about the nature of the
mixing process, this knowledge can be used to devise a transformation that will increase (some
measurement of) the independence between the sounds in the transformed mixture, compared to
the original mixture of sounds. This class of techniques will be considered in Section 4.3.
The identification of the reliable parts of the spectrum can be also achieved by measuring
the local SNR in each time–frequency point. Since neither the clean speech nor the noise are
available, a model for their combination has to be assumed. Then, either the clean speech or the
noise estimate are derived from the noisy speech. The methods for achieving this are discussed in
Section 4.4.

4.2

Auditory scene analysis

Auditory Scene Analysis (Bregman, 1990) refers to the ability of the auditory system to segregate/decompose mixtures of sounds that enter the ears into their corresponding constituents
originating from the same source. It is a theory of hearing. It lays down the principles governing
the process of putting together the signals coming from the same physical source into a coherent
perceptual stream. This process in audition seems less obvious then a similar one in vision, where
it is immediately clear that many objects will enter the field of vision. So, most of the potential
applications in audition (e.g. ASR) assume quiet, single source environment where the problem of
forming perceptual streams that correspond to the auditory “objects” (sound sources) is “solved”
apriori, as all signals originate from that source.
Today there seems to be a consensus between the researchers that (Cooke and Ellis, 1999):
• The processes of perceptual organisation operate on some kind of time–frequency representation. Typically these representations are the firing rates of the auditory nerve.
• There are bottom–up (BU) rules giving rise to cues about which parts of the speech in the
time–frequency plane might originate from the same physical source. This is called primitive
grouping.

Figure 4.1: Illustration of the law of proximity: the closer lines tend to form pairs; we tend to see
vertical stripes of dots since the horizontal distance between the dots is bigger then the vertical
(after Katz (1951, pp. 24))
• There is stored knowledge about the familiar sound patterns, e.g. speech. The representations of the familiar patterns are called schemas and the mechanisms schema–driven. The
schemas need not be complete speech units, nor even speech. “High–level” speech schemas
(if existed) would be similar to the speech models in the ASR. The problem of segregation
of sources can be solved (to a certain extent) even using schemas alone. Again, if schemas
were complete speech units, the HMM decomposition (Section 2.8.2) technique would be an
example of completely schema driven separation.
The bottom–up rules are of special interest for robust ASR. They can be considered to be
source independent apriori constraints about how likely is that a group of features comes from the
same source. They facilitate the process of streaming, in which disparate signals reaching our ears
are grouped together as coming from separate sound objects/sources. The BU constraints are not
utilised in present ASR systems. Both in audition and in vision these rules draw on a school of
thought termed Gestalt psychology and developed in the beginning of the 20-th century (Koffka,
1935; Ellis, 1955; Kohler, 1947). Gestalt psychologists explored the principles that humans use to
group sensory evidence together to form coherent objects in general (but with interest primarily
in vision). The rules they derived are applicable to audition, too (Katz, 1951):
• the law of proximity: with all other things equal, the elements closest to each other tend to
form groups. Figure 4.1 is an example of visual proximity. The acoustic components tend
to be group together according to their proximity on the time–frequency plane, too.
• the law of similarity: when more then one element type is present, similar elements tend to
form groups. Figure 4.2 illustrates this law in vision. In audition, sounds with similar pitch,
timbre, intensity or spatial location tend to form groups.
• the law of closed forms: with all other things equal, the lines enclosing a surface tend to
group together. Figure 4.3 is an example of the law applied in vision. The formulation of the
law is clearly motivated by vision (e.g. “lines”, “surface”). In audition, its meaning would
be that the grouping tends to support whole (complete) perceptual forms. The phoneme
restoration effect (Warren, 1970) is one such example. Listeners are unaware of absence

Figure 4.2: Illustration of the law of similarity: similar objects (the thick vs. thin lines, the full
vs. the empty circles) tend to form groups (after Katz (1951, pp. 25))

Figure 4.3: Illustration of the law of closed forms: lines enclosing a surface in (b) tend to form a
group while they group exactly the opposite way in (a) (after Katz (1951, pp. 26))
of short segments of speech when they are replaced by louder noise. Similarly, when parts
of speech are obscured by noise bursts, the listeners report hearing the whole sentence
and noise bursts, not a sentence interrupted by noise bursts. The sentence is perceived as
complete. The auditory system seems to selectively pick the evidence to support a whole
sentence hypothesis, as if searching for a simpler, rather than more complicated explanation.
Another example is hearing the pitch of a complex sound to be at a frequency containing
no energy at all. Taking the resolved higher harmonics into account, the auditory system
judges that the evidence outweighs the lack of energy at the frequency of the fundamental.
• the law of “good” contour, or common fate: parts that have a “good” contour, or common
faith, tend to group together. Figure 4.4 is a visual example. In audition, sounds tend
to change slowly. Speech is smoothly changing signal, because it is produced by a physical system of slowly moving articulators. The auditory system expects continuous sound
contours–sharp discontinuity in frequency, intensity or spatial location may signal a new
sound source entering the auditory scene.
• the law of common movement: elements get grouped together when they move in the same
time and/or similar manner. In hearing, common start/stop time (onset/offset) of the harmonics, common change in their amplitude (amplitude modulation–AM), or change in their
frequency at the same time (frequency modulation–FM) tend to indicate that components
belong to the same source.
• the law of experience: the comprehension of symbolic forms depends on the circumstances
under which they were learnt. This law looks slightly at odds with the previous five. It can
be considered as an acknowledgement by the Gestalt psychologists that not only bottom–
up process shape our perception (which is what the previous laws are about). Top–down
processes (dependent on the “schemas” or models acquired through experience) also play a
part in it.
It should be noted that in the real world the grouping principles compete mutually. Since real
world objects are much more complex then mere lines and dots (used here to illustrate the laws),

Figure 4.4: Illustration of the law of good contour or common faith: we see a circle and a trapezoid
because parts of each have a common destiny (after Katz (1951, pp. 26))

CHAPTER 4. MISSING DATA IDENTIFICATION

all or most of the principles have a say in the process of binding the sensory input to the perceptual
streams. Similarly, in audition, pure tones are rarely heard in the real world. The natural sound
reaching our ears every moment can be considered as a cacophony of pure tones. Further, the cues
work in concert to either mutually support a particular grouping or contradict each other. There
is also the issue of quantification – how much does a cue support particular grouping. There must
be a mechanism to resolve the contradictions and come up with a single solution to the binding
problem. It is interesting that the Gestalt psychologists have observed that the solution may
change (and even oscillate) over time, especially when several competing groupings seem equally
possible (Kohler, 1947, pp. 171).
Just as “visual illusions” offer an insight into the mechanisms of visual perception, researchers
in audition have designed experiments which reveal aspects of auditory processing. In a recent
ASA review Cooke and Ellis (1999) identified the following following cues as likely to be significant:
• synchronous transitions across frequency regions – common onset or offset
• correlated envelopes in different frequency channels, i.e. correlated frequency modulation
• unresolved harmonics – channel envelopes with periodicity at F0
• resolved harmonics – peaks in the spectrum at frequencies which are multiples of F0
• interaural time difference arising from the different path lengths of the sound to the ears
• interaural level difference due to head shadowing
• across–time similarity of whole–event attributes such as pitch, timbre
• long interval periodicity giving rise to the perception of rhythm
If we envisage a system where the various grouping cues reinforce or contradict each possible
grouping, something similar to a generalised Viterbi search in ASR may finally resolve the conflict
and come up with the most likely solution to the binding problem (Barker et al., 2000). In speech
the bottom–up processes are intermingled with the top–down schema driven processes making it
harder at assess their respective contributions to the binding.

4.2.1

Computational Auditory Scene Analysis

Computational auditory scene analysis (CASA) (Brown and Cooke, 1994)2 is a new discipline
involved in building computational models with techniques based on conclusions of the perceptual
studies of ASA (as performed by humans). In the past most of modelling effort in the speech
community was on tackling the problem of ASR alone. The CASA models are much more general
and aim to model the hearing process in general. They are of varying complexity and are built
with various aims: from low–level simulations of neurophysiological processes, through mid–level
simulations of some of the simpler tasks facing listeners (like double vowel segregation), to systems
attempting to separate mixtures of whole sentences (thus incorporating the notion of time in the
system) and/or real–world noises and acting as front–ends to ASR systems.
All systems roughly consist of two major parts. The first part performs some kind of time–
frequency analysis analogous to the one performed by the ear as an initial step. It is usually
through a filterbank with impulse response roughly matching the one of the human ear. In some
systems the neural response of the auditory nerve to the stimulus is modelled, too. Next, some
of the cues considered important for grouping (onset/offset, harmonicity, etc.) are computed and
represented in some form. The second major part of the system differs, and the systems fall into
two major groups (Cooke and Ellis, 1999):
• Weintraub (1985); Cooke (1991); Brown (1992); Wang and Brown (1999) group the information in a bottom–up fashion in the next phase. The elements are grouped together if there
is evidence for that.
2 see Rosenthal and Okuno (1998) and references therein for a recent cross–section of the field

CHAPTER 4. MISSING DATA IDENTIFICATION

56

• Cooke et al. (1993); Ellis (1996); Nakatani et al. (1998); Godsmark and Brown (1999) continue by generating hypothesis about the possible groupings and matching them with the
acoustic evidence. Sometimes the systems are termed as “blackboard architectures” or explanation based systems.
Bottom–up systems
Weintraub (1985) attempted separation of two simultaneous speakers using the estimated pitch
period of the voices. A hand crafted seven state Markov model, with states corresponding to
silence, periodic, non–periodic, onset, offset, increasing and decreasing periodicity, estimated the
power spectrum. A dual pitch tracking algorithm was used to devise and assign the signal energy
to the spectrums of the both voices.
Cooke (1991) computed time–frequency tracks called “synchrony strands” from the output
of the auditory periphery model. Their formation was guided by local similarity and continuity
constraints. They encompassed the dominant periodic components. The grouping algorithm used
the harmonicity cue for the lower frequency channels and amplitude modulation for the higher
frequency channels.
Brown (1992) used similar decomposition into synchronous partials. In addition, the pitch of
each partial was computed by combining a summary autocorrelation across the channels with the
local autocorrelation, giving rise to a pitch contour for each partial. The systems then searched
for groups with common pitch contours. Among them, the ones with common onsets were given
preference in grouping. Figure 4.5 depicts an example of grouping, segregation and the resulting
representation of the speech speech (the interfering noise is a siren).
The oscillatory correlation model of Wang and Brown (1999) departs from the symbolic representations used in the previous (and the next) models. The low – level representation is nerve
firing probability model, while the mid – level representation involves pooled (across channels)
correlation for pitch detection, and cross-correlation between the adjacent channels. However, the
search stage, where the grouping occurs, is replaced with a two layer network of oscillators. The
first layer consists of relaxation oscillators excited locally and inhibited globally. The oscillators
in the second layer are linked by lateral connections. Together, both layers implement the cues
of proximity (elements close in time and frequency are grouped together) and good continuation.
The first layer produces smaller structures, while the second layer groups these structures into
streams. The neurophysiological findings give this architecture a neurobiological foundation. The
model is also consistent with the parallel and distributed processing paradigm.
Top–down systems
Cooke et al. (1993) and Godsmark and Brown (1999) used a “blackboard” architecture for their
CASA systems. The blackboard system has a global data structure (the “blackboard”), accessible
by the modules that implement various rules (the “experts”). If some expert concludes that the
current data on the blackboard gives it a reason to act, it does so under a control of the blackboards’
monitor module (the “scheduler”). The scheduler orders the experts’ actions in time. The result
of an action is change in the blackboards’ configuration. The experts in the systems implemented
grouping by common F0 , common amplitude modulation and common onset/offset time.
Ellis (1996) utilised a “prediction – driven” architecture in his system. It segregates the
sounds by “explaining” the predictions generated by the internal “audio world model” with the
acoustic evidence. This is essentially a search for the most probable hypothesis in the space of
possible hypothesis–explanations of the observed evidence. The search is mostly heuristic. The
mid – level sound elements are: noise clouds of unstructured noise energy; tonal elements with
perceived periodicity – wefts; and transients i.e. rapid bursts without pitch or any other structure.
The system works in terms of prediction and reconciliation: depending on the current evidence,
predictions are made about the speech in the future time instant. The predictions are probabilistic
in the the sense that the mean/expected value is generated together with a margin of uncertainty
(the expected error). Each hypothesis ties together a set of mid – level elements. As new evidence

arrives, if the energy of the signal is within the bounds of the expected signal then the grouping
doesn’t change. If there is a surplus of energy, additional elements are hypothesised to account
for the energy. If the observed signal lacks energy, then some of the elements will be terminated
in a consistent manner.
This is not dissimilar to the system by Nakatani et al. (1998). Here, another paradigm for
the blackboard architecture is formulated: the data is explained through a “cooperation” of independent “agents”, specialists for particular task. There are modules (“agencies”) for creation
and destruction of agents depending of whether there is surplus or lack of energy compared to
the prediction. The architecture is termed “residual driven”. The system is binaural and uses
binaural harmonicity and localisation cues.
Performance
Despite the progress made toward a CASA system that will approach human performance, it is
widely recognised (the authors of the systems included) that the present systems have a huge gap
to bridge. Even the “second generation” of “top–down” systems which take into consideration
certain high level constraints do not approach human audition. Still, in all cases a worthwhile
improvement in SNR was noted. Lately, it has been argued (Roweis, 2000) that a statistical
approach may be better suited to the problem of reconciling the different and sometime conflicting
grouping cues.

4.2.2

Integration of CASA and ASR

Enhancement
The integration of CASA and ASR happened quite early – one of the very first systems by Weintraub (1985) assessed the quality of the separation by running the separated speech through an
ASR system and noting the resulting accuracy. The same path has been taken by the most subsequent systems: the CASA system separates the speech from the “background” first, the speech is
resynthesised from the fragments assigned to it, and the ASR system tries to recognise this speech
next. It is not hard to see why this approach of integration is so popular:
• the task is clearly separated into two independent stages, making the construction of the
systems easier
• systems that were not designed with integration in mind, can by simply integrated this way
• once CASA is considered as a “speech enhancement” process and the result of the analysis is
speech, a number of criteria (objective and subjective) can be employed to assess the quality
of enhancement (SNR, intelligibility, accuracy, etc.)
Typically, the approach yields an improvement compared to the recognition of the noisy speech (Okuno
et al., 1999), but it has not been proven that it performs significantly better then other techniques
for robust ASR (e.g. noise estimation, blind source separation).
The problems of the “enhancement path”
The “enhancement” combination of CASA and ASR has serious shortcomings. It is quite certain
that speech schemas play a role in speech perception. There are experimental examples of schemas
defeating the bottom–up grouping rules, as in the “duplex phenomena” where parts of the stimulus
are interpreted as belonging to more then one speech source. The ASR system contains a detailed
library of high level schemas – the speech models. When the CASA system is used merely as a
preprocessor prior to ASR, the models are not utilised during the separation process.
Further, separation via CASA and subsequent resynthesis introduces various distortions in
the speech signal that is input to the ASR system. The ASR systems operate best in matched
conditions: when the speech they recognise is (statistically) the same as the material they were

trained with. The resynthesised speech may be very different from the clean speech, as the scope
and the nature of the distortion introduced by CASA can not be easily assessed. This can be
ameliorated by training the ASR system on a noisy speech that has been processed with the
CASA system.
A notable problem with the “speech reconstruction” application of CASA to ASR is that CASA
systems typically assign the energy of a point in the spectrum to one source only (the principle
of exclusive allocation). When other sources are resynthesised, there is a hole in their spectrum.
This was observed by several researchers (ex: Ellis (1998, pp. 4)) and does not arise only when
separation is carried out with CASA, but with ICA (Section 4.3), too (ex: Choi et al. (1999, pp.
3)3 ). Unfortunately, the models that ASR systems use are based on coding the shape of the whole
spectrum. Holes in the spectrum (that never occurred during the training) give rise to outliers to
the p.d.f. of the spectrum shape. In a typical setup of a contemporary ASR system, an outlier in
any dimension can seriously reduce the discriminability between the models.
The problem is the one of auditory occlusion: the locally loudest source obscures all locally
quieter sources in the time–frequency representation of the signal. Section 3.2 lists the arguments
in favour of this observation which is not so intuitive (occlusion in vision seems much more natural).
Compare for example Figure 4.6 and Figure 4.7. In the former there is no reason to believe that
the black lines and the grey fill of the letter shapes continue behind the white background since
the white colour can not obscure black colour. However, the reverse is true, and the shapes reveal
themselves naturally on the latter figure.
Using partial evidence from CASA for ASR
Cooke, Green, Anderson, and Abberley (1994b); Cooke, Crawford, and Green (1994a); Cooke,
Green, and Crawford (1994c); Green, Cooke, and Crawford (1995) proposed an alternative integration of CASA with ASR: adapting the ASR system to be able to use partial evidence as
delivered by CASA. The underlying assumption is that speech is redundant enough so that it contains enough information for recognition even if occluded. Chapter 3 discusses the assumptions
and the subsequent work, while the following chapters in this work will detail the techniques and
experimental results. It is obvious that the nature of adaptation depends on the architecture of the
ASR system. Cooke et al. (1994b) approach is suited to a HMM based ASR system. Berthomier
et al. (1998) used a multiband hybrid (ANN/ASR) system for recognition of partial speech delivered by a CASA system. The CASA system utilised the harmonicity cue alone for identification
of the noisy bands. Two to the power of the number of bands recognisers were trained off–line to
cover every possible combination of noisy bands. After CASA detected the noisy bands, a matched
classifier was selected to perform the classification using the clean bands only.
But simply ignoring the evidence coming from the other sources may not be the best that can
be achieved. The nature of the masker (the object occluding other objects) can put constraints on
the nature of the maskees (the obscured objects). I.e. by knowing the masker one may not be able

to determine the “correct” maskee, but it may be able to determine which maskees did not occur.
The underlying principle of “auditory induction” was incorporated into a HMM ASR system by
Green et al. (1995), and Holmes and Sedgwick (1986) proposed the same technique earlier coming
from entirely different premises and motivation. In any time–frequency representation of speech,
the masker puts a higher–bound constraint on what the energy of maskees could have been in that
time–frequency point. Barker et al. (2000) used the constraint in a full–blown integrated Viterbi
search for simultaneously finding the most probable grouping and the most probable sentence in
the presence of noise.4

4.3

Independent component analysis for blind source separation

Simulating ASA is not the only way of recovering a signal from a mixture of signals. It can be
seen as a specialisation of a well researched problem in the signal processing community – the
problem of blind source separation (BSS). The problem of BSS is defined as separation (recovery)
of the signals produced by several sources from their linear mixture, without any knowledge about
the sources themselves (hence the term “blind”). In a typical BSS model there are N receivers
picking up the mixture of the M source signals (N ≥ M ). This is related to the problem of blind
deconvolution, which in the simplest case tries to find an inverse of an unknown filter which is
convolved with one source (there are also extensions for multiple signals) by observing the resulting
signal only. It is also somewhat related to the principal component analysis (PCA): geometrically,
PCA seeks an orthogonal axis on which the observations are projected, such that the projections
are uncorrelated (but not necessarily independent). Taking higher order statistics into account,
the independent component analysis (ICA) tries to recover the axis of projection not necessarily
geometrically orthogonal, but on which the data projections are statistically independent.
In the case of instantaneous mixing, and neglecting the noise in the process, the independent component analysis (ICA) assumes the mixing model (see (Hyvarinen, 1999; Lee, 1998) and
references therein):
x = As
(4.1)
where s = (s1 , . . . sn )T are the sources which are independent, A is the unknown mixing matrix
and x = (x1 , . . . xm )T is the observed mixture. The independence of the sources is a stronger
requirement then uncorrelation, since it implies:5
E{g1 (xi )g2 (xj )} − E{g1 (xi )}E{g2 (xj )} = 0

for i 6= j

instead of mere E{xi xj } − E{xi }E{xj } = 0 for i 6= j for any functions g1 and q2 .

The aim of ICA is given a set of measurements {x(t)} to recover the the original signals {s(t)}.
Without getting too far into the problem of identifiability of the model, it can be said that at most
one source can be Gaussian, usually there have to be more sensors then sources (although some
solutions for the reverse case are not impossible) and the mixing matrix must be a full column
rank. Even then, the matrix A can be recovered only up to a column permutation (the model puts
no constraint on the order of the sources) and up to a multiplicative constant for each column
(since it can be cancelled by dividing the corresponding source with it).
Methods for ICA consist of two major parts:
• an objective function to measure the amount of independence between the transformed
measurements
• an algorithm that is used to perform the optimisation
As an illustration, we will present the maximum likelihood objective function (since it best suits
the probabilistic framework in which the ASR systems are discussed here), and gradient descent
based optimisation (since it is the simplest and most often used). We will also assume M = N

ICA for speech separation
Separation of sound sources is one of the classical applications of ICA. Usually the signals are
separated in time domain and entirely independently from the ASR system (Lee et al., 1997; Choi
et al., 1999), and then fed into the system. Extended algorithms, handling delays in addition to
the mixing between the sources are usually employed in the experiments. This setup is similar to
a real life situation of several sources in a reverberant room. There are known problems with this
approach:
(a) the “separated speech” contains low energy regions (“holes” in the spectrum) where the
other source was dominant. A conventional recogniser can’t handle that naturally. Choi
et al. (1999) resorted to heuristics like thresholding. A missing data recogniser could handle
this easily, if the locations of the “holes” were known.
(b) even after the separation, the interfering source can be heard in the background. The
recogniser picks this nevertheless and resulting in a huge number of insertion errors. This
“cross–hearing” is due to poor separation–this is closely related to the next problem.
(c) the quality of the separation is limited because the speech model that is used is crude. Even
methods that do not explicitly assume the p.d.f. of the sources, do so implicitly (e.g. the
squashing non–linearity in (Bell and Sejnowski, 1995) represents the cumulative p.d.f. of
the sources, and its a–priori choice amounts to assumption about the form of sources p.d.f.).
When assuming some speech distribution, Laplacian p.d.f. p(x) = α2 e−α|x| (for α > 0) is
usually chosen to express the sparsity of speech distribution. In contrast, the ASR recogniser
not only has an extensive model about the speech distribution(s), but also a dynamic model
of how the speech source (articulators) change and evolve over time. This is not utilised
in the separation phase. It has been reported (on non–ASR task) that separation can gain
significantly from a known signal distribution (Torkkola, 1996).
These problems are in addition to the problems already inherent to ICA that make the ASR
application problematic:
• needs at least two microphones
• the resulting unmixing matrix is undetermined up to a scaling factor per column and column
permutation
The latter problems have been addressed by Ikeda and Murata (1999) with some success, as
discussed in the next section. However, it seems that the question of whether it may be better to
use a more appropriate model than ICA in the first place is still open.
ICA in the spectral domain
A possible solution to some of the problems may be to perform the separation in the spectral
domain. The accuracy of the separation seems to be much better there (Zibulevsky and Pearlmutter, 1999)8 . Ikeda and Murata (1999) reported on ICA for spectrogram–like speech features.
The ambiguity of the scaling factor was resolved by projecting the signals back onto the observations space and comparing the projections with the true observations. The ambiguity of the
permutation was handled by imposing continuity constraints on the separated signals.
Wu et al. (1998a) used the missing data assumption that only one of the sources is dominant
in the mixture to speed up the iterative process at no loss of accuracy. Both methods (Ikeda and
Murata, 1999; Wu et al., 1998a) have also been applied to the case of more signals then sensors.
In fact, nothing in the derivation of the learning rule in Eq. (4.6) requires equal or grater number
of sensors then sources.
8 The conclusion is based on Figure 7 on page 13. The figure compares the newly proposed method with few
other ICA methods. However, it is notable that all methods exhibit relative separation errors in the spectral domain
almost an order of magnitude smaller than in the time domain

CHAPTER 4. MISSING DATA IDENTIFICATION

63

However, ICA application on the spectrograms introduces a new problem: treating the bands
in the spectrogram as independent sources is quite unjustified. But if this constraint is not
enforced at all, and the assumption that the p.d.f. of the sources is factorisable is removed, then
instantaneous ICA degenerates into a Maximum Likelihood Linear Regression (MLLR–commonly
used for speaker adaptation) with gradient descent search for the best (un)mixing matrix (instead
of the more usual EM algorithm).
An example of a more accurate model would be:
• for each feature vector x, two subsets of features exist: one subset coming from the speech
source, and the other subset generated by the other (noise) source
• there is an accurate model of the speech source, and no model or very weak model (some
a–priori assumptions like Laplacian density or on–line single channel noise estimation) for
the other source
• the subsets change on a per–frame basis
• we have prior knowledge that the subsets are usually localised in the time–frequency plane,
i.e. it is more probable that a whole patch belongs to one source
The Multidimensional ICA model (MICA) (Cardoso, 1998) is an extension of ICA for handling
multidimensional signals. This is equivalent to assuming that in the unmixed space groups of
features are going to come from the same source and thus are not going to be independent. MICA
model rewrites the ICA model (Eq. (4.1)) as sum of independent components model (similarly
to PCA). Unlike ICA, the MICA model is uniquely determined. However, we are not aware of
a general algorithm for MICA. The model was tested by performing ICA on the data first, and
then manually selecting the non–independent components to be “merged”. Also, it was assumed
that the subsets of the components are constant. In the auditory scene the subsets change on a
per–frame basis.

4.3.1

ICA and CASA

Given that both CASA and ICA have been applied to the same task of speech separation from
a mixture of sounds, it is interesting to see how they compare. Although both rest on the same
premise of independence of the physical sources, ICA is more data driven, while CASA is more
knowledge driven. CASA typically operates with one sensor (or two if binaural cues are used),
while ICA needs two sensors or more. Further, ICA usually needs at least as many sensors as
sources.
van der Kouwe, Wang, and Brown (1999) compared CASA and ICA on a 100 speech and noise
mixtures from Cooke (1991) (there are 10 voiced utterances mixed with 10 noises). The CASA
system used was a monaural one by Wang and Brown (1999). The ICA algorithm performed joint
approximate diagonalisation of eigen matrices (JADE) (Cardoso (1997)) on two linear mixtures
of the speech and the noise. Comparison of the SNR before and after the separation showed that
CASA performed better then ICA on 2 of the noises, while ICA performed better on the remaining
8 noises. CASA favoured locally narrowband, continuous and structured noises (1 kHz tone and
siren), while ICA performed better on the rest of the noises.
Okuno et al. (1999) combined CASA and ICA trying to cover their respective weaknesses and
combine their advantages. The combined system acted as a speech enhancement preprocessor
to an ASR system. When used alone, ICA leaded to better accuracy in two–speaker scenes,
while CASA was more successful with three or more speakers. Their combination achieved better
accuracy then either of them alone.

Noise and Local Signal-to-Noise Ratio estimation for
separation

Single channel noise and local SNR estimation9 techniques can be used for identification of the reliable parts of the spectrum. Their estimate can be either thresholded yielding hard missing/present
data separation, or used as reliability measure of the points in the time–frequency (T–F) plane.
We are going to consider the techniques which use a mixture of the signal and the noise to obtain their estimates. Typically they assume the additive speech and noise combination in time
x(t) = s(t) + n(t) and power spectrum X 2 (w) = S 2 (w) + N 2 (w) domains. They are adaptive
without explicit speech/silence detection.
Martin (1993, 2001) tracks the minimal envelope of the noisy speech x smoothed power spectrum Ȳx (t):
Yx (t) = Yx (t − 1) + x2 (t) − x2 (t − 1)
Ȳx (t) = αȲx (t − 1) + (1 − α)Yx (t)

(4.7)

Next, the time window of approximately L = 0.625 sec is divided in few W (ex: W = 4) smaller
windows, and the minimum of the smoothed spectrum Ȳx (t) in each of the windows is determined.
If the sequence of the windows minima monotonically increases, then it is assumed that the noise
increases rapidly and the minimum of the last window is the noise power. Otherwise, the smallest
value of all windows minimas is the noise power. This value is multiplied by an overestimation
factor (from 1.3 to 2, depending on the length of the windows used for power estimation and
minima calculation), and is bounded from above by the power of the speech plus noise mixture.
The estimator is biased when there is no speech present.
Ris and Dupont (2001) used a variant of the same algorithm of minima tracking. For each
frequency band, on the basis of N consecutive frames, n (typically n = N/5) minimal values were
averaged to estimate the noise level in each band.
Hirsch and Enrichter (1995) proposed two algorithms for noise estimation. Both operate on
the outputs of a filterbank in the spectral magnitude domain.
The first algorithm calculates weighted first order average for each channel separately, on a
per–sample basis. When the energy in the channel exceeds a certain threshold (the threshold is
set to be the last computed average scaled by an overestimation factor of β = 1.5 to 2.5), it is
considered that a speech segment starts and the recursive computation is stopped. The calculated
average thus far is taken as the value of the noise energy at that moment:
(
αN (t − 1, w) + (1 − α)X(t − 1, w) if X(t, w) ≤ βN (t − 1, w)
N (t, w) =
(4.8)
αN (t − 1, w) otherwise
Ris and Dupont (2001) noted that the above method overestimates the noise in low SNR. Therefore
a second order recursion was added to compute the variance of the noise estimate, in addition to
its mean:
varN (t, w) = α var(t − 1, w) + (1 − α)(X(t, w) − N (t, w))2
(4.9)
Further, the frames were grouped in time segments of several frames, the estimates of the mean
and the variance of the noise were computed on a per segment basis, and for all the frames in the
new segment Eq. (4.8) and (4.9) were applied in the frames where:
|X(t, w) − N (t − 1, w)| ≤ k · σN (w)

(4.10)

where σN (w) is the deviation of the previous segment.
The second algorithm reported by Hirsch (1993) is based on computing the histograms (with
roughly 40 bins) of the noisy speech energy which is below the threshold computed with Eq. (4.8)
9 local SNR estimation refers to estimated SNR in each point in a T–F plane, as opposed to some average of the
SNR along the time and/or frequency axis

in each subband over a 400ms time window. The values above a threshold are not take into
account – they are considered to belong to speech, not noise. The histograms are computed using
the values below threshold for each channel separately. The maximum of the distribution is taken
to be the value of the noise energy in a particular channel.
Similarly, it was noticed that the histograms both of the clean and the noisy subbands feature
two distinct peaks (Ris and Dupont, 2001)10 (Figure 4.8). The low energy mode is related to
the presumed speech pauses or noisy frames, and the high energy mode is related to the speech
frames. The modes are well separated for clean speech and mid–SNRs, and get closer as the SNR
decreases. For low SNR they finally merge into one single mode. Therefore, the distributions
in each band were modelled by two Gaussians and EM and K–means clustering algorithms were
used to fit a two Gaussians mixture to the histograms. The difference between the means of the
Gaussians is directly related to the local SNR of the noisy speech in each band.
A method based on subbands quantile11 filtering was reported by Stahl, Fischer, and Bippus
(2000). Again it is assumed that the speech pauses in the subbands are going to be filled with
noise as the noise level increases. Quantile with q = 0.55 was used for the experiments as the

and reported in length by Ris and Dupont (2001)

subband noise estimate. It should be noted that if the window of the analysis is not long enough
to encompass enough speech silences, then the quantile is essentially going to estimate the speech
(not the noise), similarly to median smoothing commonly used in image processing to decrease
the effect of the impulsive noise.
All methods mentioned above rely on the assumption that there are going to be enough frames
with silent speech that are going to be filled with noise as the SNR decreases. However, if the
frequency resolution is good enough to resolve the harmonics of the F0 , which are going to correspond to the spectral peaks (see Section 3.5.7), the spectral valleys between them are going to
contain low speech energy. They are going to fill with noise first, and provide enough data for
noise estimation. Therefore, the reliance on speech pauses can be lessened and the segments over
which the histograms and the averages are computed can be shortened. Ris and Dupont (2001)
used a 64ms long window for this purpose.
Meyer, Simmer, and Kammeyer (1999) assessed the performance of some of the above algorithms. The task was estimation of the noise given the mixture of clean speech and slowly
amplitude–modulated noise. All algorithms perform bad with rapidly increasing noise and better
with decreasing noise. In the latter case, Martin (1993)’s algorithm performed better then Hirsch’s
weighted algorithm at SNRs close to zero.
Ris and Dupont (2001) tested some of the methods described above with six types of noises,
both artificial and realistic. They measured the mean square error (MSE) between the true and
estimated noise level in the 700 Hz to 1600 Hz region. The results did not indicate any of the the
techniques to be a clear winner. Depending on the noise type, different noise estimation methods
came best. The only consensus seems to be that all noise estimation methods preferred better
frequency then time resolution.
Any of the above techniques can be used used in an ASR system which can perform classification
with partial data. In that case:
• the negative spectrum (improbable, assuming enough smoothing of the power spectrum) can
be treated as missing (Drygajlo and El-Maliki, 1998a)
• a threshold for the estimated local SNR can be set to to separate the features as present or
missing
• the estimated SNR can be used as a measure of how reliable the feature is
In this sense, the local SNR estimation techniques can be used for speech separation.

Summary

Techniques for speech source separation were discussed in this chapter. CASA uses the low level
properties of sound that are believed to be used by humans to facilitate separation. ICA assumes
independence of the sources and the way they combine to yield the observations, and then transforms the signals trying to enhance their independence in the transformed space. The local noise
and SNR estimation estimation techniques use well known heuristics about the speech and the
noise to build models of the noise from limited data.
None of the techniques claims to be the complete solution to the problem of separation. They
all have problems hindering their application. However, each on its own may deliver certain
constraints that would make the ASR search for the best explanation of the data more accurate.
For example, having the missing data of speech in mind, on–line noise estimation might provide
some noise model estimate. ICA might use that model together with the speech models of the
recogniser to update the probability of two sets of features coming from different sources by
assessing their independence. CASA might deliver another update of what features are likely to
have come from the speech source.12

Robust ASR with missing data in
an HMM system
5.1

Introduction

The aim of this chapter is to show how techniques for handling missing and unreliable data can be
integrated in today’s standard ASR systems. These systems model the speech source as a Hidden
Markov model (HMM). They assume that, during recognition, the data the HMM is matched
against was generated by a single speech source. However, as discussed previously, in most real–
life situations this is not true. The observations picked up by a microphone are a mixture of
several sound sources. Human audition has an intriguing property of being able to attend to one
source in the mixture alone. The ASR systems fail completely in such conditions. This is not
a fault of the speech HMM. Its parameters were inferred during training with the assumption
that all features in the multidimensional observation were generated by the speech source. As
argued in Chapter 3, a range of phenomena like: (a) easy handling of bandwidth restrictions and
severe alterations in time–frequency (T–F) plane; (b) evidence of winner–takes–all physiological
processes; (c) psychoacoustics findings maybe offer an insight into some of the principles that
underline the robustness of the human speech recognition (HSR).
In this chapter the same principles are applied to a HMM based ASR system. After a brief
introduction into the structure of such system, the missing data (MD) model for speech recognition
is introduced. In addition to the “standard” model of the speech source, the MD model envisages
a model of the mask. The mask model determines the robustness of the speech features. Two
techniques can be used to implement the MD model: marginalisation and imputation. They are
rooted in two complementary statistical approaches for treating missing data. The MD model
accounts for a non–stationary environment by frame-by-frame on–line adaptation. The aim of the
adaptation is to match to the speech HMM the features that originated from that speech source
only. Features originating from other sources can be matched to their models, if such are available.
If not, the MD recogniser can make the best out of the available data. A variant of the MD model
can be used for separation, as the separation and the recognition are tied together.

5.2

An outline of an HMM based ASR system

The operation of a typical contemporary continuous density HMM based ASR system is depicted
on Figure 5.1 (see any ASR textbook for further references, e.g. Rabiner and Juang (1993)). Each
HMM model represents a single speech unit. The speech units are usually context sensitive phones
for larger vocabulary tasks (e.g. dictation), and whole words for small vocabulary, command–and–
control type tasks. The architecture of the HMMs (number of states, topology, the parametric
form of the state p.d.f.s) is decided apriori. The free parameters are the transition probabilities

Figure 5.1: Scheme of operation of a typical HMM based ASR system
and the parameters of the state p.d.f.s. In addition, when HMMs are subword units, a phonetic
dictionary maps strings of subword units into words. In all but the simplest tasks there exists a
grammar – a set of rules about how the words are put together into sentences.
There are two modes of operation: training (inference of the unknown system parameters)
and testing (recognition). In both cases the incoming speech is divided into overlapping frames.
Each frame is windowed (multiplied with a windowing function) and transformed to yield a feature
vector. Then during:
Training time: The transcription of the utterance hence the corresponding HMM sequence is known
in advance (but the boundaries between the HMMs need not be known). The HMMs of
all units in the utterance are concatenated into a composite HMM. An efficient recursive
forward–backward algorithm iteratively updates the free parameters of the composite
HMM to increase1 the likelihood of the training data feature vectors. The algorithm
belongs to the Expectation–Maximisation (EM) class of algorithms (Dempster et al.
(1977) – see Section 3.4.1). The hidden variable is the state sequence that the source
went through while producing the observations.
Testing time: For an isolated words ASR with whole word HMMs, the likelihood of each HMM
producing the data can be computed. This is known as the forward probability. The
HMM with the highest score is the recognised word. However, this mode of operation
is hard to extend to connected word recognition. So instead of taking into account all
possible paths through the HMM in order to compute the likelihood that the data was
produced by the HMM, only the path with the highest likelihood is computed. This is
known as a Viterbi search. In practise, the likelihood of the best path (called Viterbi
path) is so much greater then the likelihoods of all other paths, that picking that score
alone instead of adding all scores makes little difference. The advantage of the Viterbi
search is that it extends naturally to efficiently handle the connected word recognition
task.
It is possible to use the Viterbi search during the training, too. In each iteration the data is
aligned to the states on the Viterbi path. All the data deemed to be generated by one state is
1 more precise, not to decrease

CHAPTER 5. ROBUST ASR WITH MISSING DATA IN AN HMM SYSTEM

pooled together and the parameters of the state p.d.f. are updated to increase the likelihood of
that data. The transition probabilities can be updated by merely counting the number of times
the particular states transition appears. The process is repeated iteratively, obtaining increasingly
better parameters and better alignment in each iteration. This is known as Viterbi training. It is
used infrequently because the forward–backward training is efficient enough. Viterbi training can
be used to quickly retrain the models when only the feature extraction module of the ASR system
changes, or to adapt the system on–line during recognition.2

5.3

The missing data model for robust speech recognition

The missing data (MD) model for robust speech recognition assumes that:
• local patches in some time–frequency representation of the speech spectrum remain mostly
unaffected by the other sounds even at poor global SNRs
• they can be identified with a certain probability
• there is sufficient quantity of information there for recognition of the partial speech
So, instead of the usual single source ASR Viterbi decoding:
W∗

=

argmaxP (W |O) = argmaxP (O|W )P (W )

where O is a sequence of observations (data vectors), W is the hypothesised word, W ∗ is the most

model is:

(5.2)

where M is a mask determining which features were generated by the source that is decoded. A
simple example of a mask would be a binary matrix. The MD model makes provision for multiple
sources via the mask. The mask captures the prior information about:
• how reliable the features are
• which combinations of features tend to “stick together” above the noise
2 The relation between Viterbi and Baum-Welch training is similar to the one between the K-means and EM
algorithms for fitting mixtures of Gaussian to data. The former algorithms assume hard decision, i.e. the data was
either generated or not generated by the state/mixture. The latter allow for every point to have been generated by
every state/mixture with a certain probability.

CHAPTER 5. ROBUST ASR WITH MISSING DATA IN AN HMM SYSTEM

Features deemed to have been generated by the (speech) source of interest will be refereed to as
“present” and indicated accordingly by the binary mask. Features deemed to have been generated
by other source(s) which are not of direct interest for the ASR system will be refereed to as
“missing”.
An alternative form for Eq. (5.2) is:
W∗

= argmaxP (W |O) = argmaxP (O|W )P (W )
W
W
X X

P (O|Q, M, W )P (Q|M, W )P (M |W )P (W )

(5.3)

all M

where it is assumed that the path Q is independent of the mask M (hence P (Q|M, W ) = P (Q|W )).
In this form the mask M is conditioned on the word W , but not on the state path Q.
The factors in the expression above represent:
P (W )

the probability of the word regardless of the acoustic observations (comes
from the language model)

P (Q∗ |W )

the probability of the most likely path Q∗

P (M |Q∗ , W )

(or P (M |W )) the probability of the mask (determining which features
were generated by the state or the word)

P (O|M, Q∗ , W )

the probability of the partial observations

Figure 5.2 shows a mask example. In the top row, the left panel shows a clean speech TIdigits (Leonard, 1984) digits utterance (“1159”). It is mixed with NOISEX factory noise (Varga
et al., 1992) shown in the middle panel. The right panel depicts the noisy speech at global SNR of
0dB. The representation is a smoothed 64–channel auditory filter bank (centre frequencies spaced
linearly in ERB-rate from 50 to 8000Hz), computed every 10ms (Cooke, 1991).
The panels in the middle depict three different masks. The red areas in the masks indicate
presence of speech in the noisy signal, while the blue regions indicate absence of speech. The masks
are derived assuming additivity of the speech and the noise in the power spectral domain. The left
one is derived by comparing the clean and the noisy speech, and selecting as speech points those
with local SNR of 7dB and more. The middle one is derived from a local SNR estimate, based on
a stationary noise estimate from the noisy speech (with the same 7dB threshold criterion). The
right one is derived by comparing the speech estimate used for spectral subtraction (SS) and noisy
speech and treating the points where speech estimate is smaller then the noisy speech as non–
speech. The panels in the bottom row show the noisy speech as “seen through” the corresponding
masks. They illustrate that even at SNR of 0dB, with on average equally loud speech and noise,
large parts of speech spectrum are unaffected.
Separation with the MD model
The MD model for robust ASR integrates the separation of the speech and the noise with the
recognition of the speech. Finding the mask amounts to separation of the speech and the noise.

The problem of separation is reduced to Viterbi search (dynamic programming), too.
The integration of the separation and the recognition with the MD model is possible for a
simple model of the acoustic environment. The combination of speech and noise in a all–or–
nothing manner (each feature is generated by the speech or the noise exclusively) is a significant
simplification. It may not be a viable one for a complicated environment with convolutional noise
and/or reverberation. But for additive noise it is largely appropriate for several reasons already
discussed in Section 3.2. Experimental comparisons with techniques like PMC do not indicate
performance loss due to this simplification (Renevey, 2000, pp. 149). Further:
• The small difference in performance of multiconditional models on seen and unseen noises (Hirsch
and Pearce, 2000) may suggest that there is insufficient structure in the noises to infer strong

CHAPTER 5. ROBUST ASR WITH MISSING DATA IN AN HMM SYSTEM

72

noise models/constraints. This supports the argument that the rich speech structure should
be the primary source of constraints needed for separation.
• The speech and the noise are independent sources (i.e. the mutual information is zero). The
only way in which the noise source constrains the speech source is through the environmental
function that combines the observations generated from both sources into a noisy observation. The MD model can capture most of this information via the usage of counterevidence
(Section 5.5.7), if the variance of the noise is reasonably large, as is the case for most of the
noises.
Chapter 7 contains more detailed discussion about the relative merits on the noise models and
counterevidence in Section 7.2.4.

5.4

Modelling the mask

The introduction of a mask decomposes the problem of robust ASR3 into two subproblems: separation and recognition. Contrary to some other models (e.g. HMM decomposition), where decoding
one source implies decoding all sources, the mask allows for decoding of one source only while
disregarding the other sources present in the auditory scene.
At present it is unclear which is the most appropriate form for the mask model.
While experimenting, it is useful to use oracle masks (Figure (5.2), left panel of the middle
row). They can be computed by comparing the clean speech and noise4 . This is helpful while
evaluating different strategies for computing the likelihood of the partial data P (O|M, Q, W ), since
the influence of imperfect separation is minimised. It can also provide an idea about the upper
limits on the performance that can be achieved. The oracle mask M ∗ has probability of 1 and is
independent of Q∗ and W .
For “production” ASR, local SNR estimation based on noise estimation (Figure (5.2), middle
panel of the middle row) was used to compute the mask model in the experiments (see Chapter 6).
Ideally, CASA would be the method of choice for building this model. Barker et al. (2001b) have
successfully merged the former with elements of the latter (harmonicity based masks) in their
system. Seltzer et al. (2000) used a static classifier for mask estimation with good results, roughly
half way between the noise estimation results and results with “oracle” masks. Roweis (2000)
used speaker dependent HMMs to learn speaker dependent mask models solely for the purpose of
separation and (successful) reconstruction.
Faced with integrating several sources of evidence, the most plausible route seems a statistical
model. Chapter 7 discusses further the issues pertinent to building a mask model and the properties
that would be desirable for the model to have.

5.4.1

Computing the sum over all possible masks

Approximation
The summation for all M in Eqs. (5.2) and (5.3) is over all possible masks. In general, the
number of possible masks per frame is prohibitively large: two to the power of number of features.
However, under assumptions similar to ones leading to the Viterbi approximation in Eq. (5.1):
(a) the most likely (ML)5 mask M ∗ will be much more likely than any other mask M , i.e.
P (M ∗ |Q∗ , W ) À P (M |Q∗ , W ) for M 6= M ∗
(b) the likelihoods of the data that the corresponding masks will give rise to (P (O|M ∗ , Q∗ , W )
and P (O|M, Q∗ , W )) will behave similarly, i.e. P (O|M ∗ , Q∗ , W ) À P (O|M, Q∗ , W ) for
M 6= M ∗
3 when viewed as decoding one source while listening to several
4 or clean and noisy speech – but then a model of acoustic environment is needed to derive the SNR
5 ML will be used both for “most likely” and “maximum likelihood”

CHAPTER 5. ROBUST ASR WITH MISSING DATA IN AN HMM SYSTEM

73

The summation over all possible masks (weighted by their probability) may be approximated by
selection of the most probable mask M ∗ :
W∗

argmaxP (O|M ∗ , Q∗ , W )P (M ∗ |Q∗ , W )P (Q∗ |W )P (W )

≈

(5.6)

W

or its analog for Eq. (5.3):
W∗

argmaxP (O|M ∗ , Q∗ , W )P (Q∗ |W )P (M ∗ |W )P (W )

≈

(5.7)

W

This means that is is sufficient to select the HMM model/“word” W ∗ whose most likely mask M ∗
gives rise to the biggest of the partial data likelihoods on the most likely path Q∗ .
The motive for approximation of the sum over all masks M with selection of the most probable
mask M ∗ is the same as to the original Viterbi approximation6 (Eq. (5.1)). The likelihood of the
features not generated by this (or any other HMM model available) is small and may be neglected
in the sum.
Exact calculation in a special case
In the special case when both the state and the mask p.d.f.s are sums of factorisable distributions,
and when the independence assumptions are taken into account (see Section 5.5), an efficient
computation of the sum over all possible masks in Eq. (5.2) is possible (Appendix D, Eq. (D.5)):

The result is intuitive: the contribution of the present and missing features to the likelihood
should be weighted by the probability of them being present or missing. A discrete mask is a
special case where the probabilities of a feature present/missing is either 0 or 1. The missing
features (observations generated by the non–speech source) can still contribute to the likelihood of
the speech source model – their contribution can be exploited as counterevidence (Section 5.5.7).

5.5

Computing the likelihood of the partial observations

Assuming that O = {o(t)}t=1...T , Q = {q(t)}t=1...T and M = {m(t)}t=1...T where t is the time
frame, T is the total number of frames, o(t) is the observation vector, q(t) is the state the speech
source was in at time t and m(t) is the framewise mask for frame t, the mask m(t) divides the
feature vector x into a present part xp and a missing part xm at time t.7 This means that
the observation o(t) was only partly generated by the speech source in state q(t). The feature
subvector op (t) of the vector o(t) was generated by the speech source that is being decoded (and
a model is certainly available). The remaining subvector om (t) was generated by some other,
possibly noise, source. A model of this source might, or might not, be available.
Taking into account the independence assumptions:
6 a “folk conjecture” in the ASR community is that transition probabilities are unimportant in the overall
likelihood compared to the emission probabilities; however, it is the “ordering” of the HMM states enforced by
fixing most of the transition probabilities to zero that yields advantage over a mere mixture model.
7 o(t) is the realisation of the random variable x at time t

CHAPTER 5. ROBUST ASR WITH MISSING DATA IN AN HMM SYSTEM

74

• the observations are independent, i.e. o(t) is independent of o(t − 1)
• each observation o(t) is dependent only on the state q(t)
The likelihood of the partial data P (O|M, Q, W ) from Eq. (5.2)becomes:
P (O|M, Q, W ) =

T
Y

P (o(t)|m(t), q(t), W )

(5.9)

t=1

The conditioning on the mask m(t) determines which features of the feature vector o(t) were
produced by the speech source when in state q(t). It divides the observation random variable x
into a present part xp and a missing part xm :
x = (xp , xm )

(5.10)

As mentioned in Chapter 3, knowing the probability distribution of the whole observation, there
are two possible ways to compute the probability of the partial observation: marginalisation and
imputation. In the case of marginalisation the probability distribution itself is adapted to yield
the distribution of the partial data. In the case of imputation, the conditional distribution of
the unobserved given the observed data is computed from the joint distribution, and a “suitable”
point on the curve is picked as a plug–in replacement of the unobserved data. Then the joint data
distribution can be used to asses the probability “full” data vector. These strategies are discussed
next in the context of an HMM based ASR system.

5.5.1

Marginalisation in an HMM based MD ASR system

Dropping the conditioning on W and time index t where not necessary and replacing the probability
distribution P with probability density distribution p to suit a continuous random variable x, the
factor P (o|m, q) from Eq. (5.9) becomes (Ahmad and Tresp, 1993):
Z
p(o|m, q) = p(op |q) = p(op , xm |q)dxm
(5.11)
where xm is a subvector of x completely determined by the mask m. Depending on m, different
sets of features need to be marginalised in each frame.
The state p.d.f. in a typical HMM system is a mixture of multivariate diagonal Gaussians:

(5.13)

The assumption that the state p.d.f. can be modelled by a Gaussian mixture with diagonal
covariance matrices is crucial for practical implementation of a MD ASR system. Both for MD
and non–MD ASR system the number of free parameters (and consequently the amount of data
needed for their estimation) is significantly smaller. Further, sufficient number of components in
the mixture can approximate not only rotation of the distribution (that full covariance matrix can
model as well), but also non–Gaussian distributions and/or multimodal distributions (that full
covariance matrix can not model). In addition, while still
p(xp , xm |q) 6= p(xp |q)p(xm |q),

(5.14)

CHAPTER 5. ROBUST ASR WITH MISSING DATA IN AN HMM SYSTEM

75

“inside” each mixture component
p(xp , xm |k, q) = p(xp |k, q)p(xm |k, q),

(5.15)

since the independence (between any two features) makes
p(xm |xp , k, q) = p(xm |k, q).

(5.16)

This is important for efficient computation of the marginal state p.d.f., which has to be performed in every frame for all states in the MD HMM system. The marginal of the general
multivariate normal distribution:

However, for efficient computation the inverted covariance of the partial data (Σpp )−1 is needed
(instead of the readily available Σpp ). As it can not be easily derived from Σ−1 with a general
covariance matrix8 , a matrix inversion per state per frame is needed to adapt the HMM system
in every frame. This is very costly.
But, if all pairs of features are mutually independent, implying a diagonal covariance matrix
(only the variances are non–zero) the state p.d.f. marginal Eq. (5.11) is:

This form lends itself to efficient calculation. It simply states that only the contributions (to the
likelihood) of the present features need to be taken into account.

5.5.2

Imputation in an HMM based MD ASR system

The second strategy for computing the likelihood of partial observations p(o|m, q) from Eq. (5.9)
(see Section 5.5) is to “fill in”, impute the missing observations using the knowledge of the data
density, and then continue as if the imputed features were the “true” (but the unobserved) ones.9
The non–speech observations om (t) are disregarded as they are not generated from the speech
source. Instead, estimates ôm (t) are obtained and used further. It seems natural to use some form
of conditional data distribution p(xm (t)|xp (t)) to come up with a “sensible” ôm (t) to impute.
In the context of an HMM based recogniser, there are two possible conditional distributions
that can be used to draw the imputed values from: the data distribution p(xm |xp ) or the state
conditioned data distribution p(xm |xp , q). In the former case there is a single value which is
−1
−1
8 For example, (Σ−1 )
−1 , (Σ−1 )
−1 , etc.
pp = (Σpp − Σpm Σmm Σmp )
mm = (Σmm − Σmp Σpp Σpm )
9 imputation makes sense only with generative models; if the data density is not inferred during the training, then

it needs to be inferred separately solely for the purpose of imputation, as is the case with the hybrid, non–HMM
based ASR systems, e.g. (Dupont, 1998)

imputed. This case will be labelled Global Data Imputation (GDI). In the latter case as many
values can be imputed as there are states resulting in as many different frames. This may seem as
unsurmountable difficulty. However, during the Viterbi search, when estimating the probability
that a particular frame was generated by a particular state, not all frames need to be assessed. It
is enough to compute the likelihood of the frame whose missing values were imputed from that
state conditional p.d.f. The rationalisation being that it is already assumed that the speech source
was in that particular state. This case will be termed State conditioned Data Imputation (SDI).

5.5.3

Global data imputation

Computing the data distribution p(xm |xp ) in an HMM based system is straightforward, as all
state conditioned distributions are available. Hence:
p(xm |xp ) =

“Probability of a state”

The prior probability of the state q, P (q), can either be computed exactly, by the recursive:10
P (q) =

T
X
t=1

P (q(t) = q) =

T X

P (q(t − 1) = q 0 )P (q(t) = q|q(t − 1) = q 0 )

t=1 allq 0

or approximately, as the relative frequency with which the state q appears in the state aligned
training data. In the case of a straight–through HMM (HMM with no skip states, which is commonly used for speech recognition) the latter can be derived from the transition probabilities11
as:
1/[1 − s(q)]
P (q) = P
(5.22)
0
all q 0 1/[1 − s(q )]
where s(q) is the probability
P that the speech source stays in state q once it is in it P (q(t) =
q|q(t − 1) = q), the sum all q0 is over all states (across HMM models) and it is assumed that
there is no grammar (every word/HMM sequence is equally likely).
In almost all continuous–density (CD) HMM based ASR systems the state p.d.f.s p(x|q) are
mixtures of diagonal Gaussians (Eq. (5.12)). Considering the somewhat more general case of a
10 abusing the notation for consistency – q stands for a particular state (a realisation of a random variable) while
q(t) stands for the state the source is in time t (a random variable)
11 The transition probabilities may be derived themselves from the state aligned training data. Absence of skip
state makes thePreverse computation possible: the expected number of frames N (q) generated from state q is
n
E{N (q)} = 1 + ∞
n=0 n[s(q)] [1 − s(q)], where the 1 comes from the straight through HMM (the model must pass
through each state at least once) and the infinite sum is the expected number of frames the source remains in state
q once it is in it. The infinite sum evaluates to s(q)/[1 − s(q)], giving rise
Pto E{N (q)} = 1/[1 − s(q)] and leading to
Eq. (5.22) which uses the expected number of frames P (q) = E{N (q)}/ q0 E{N (q 0 )} instead of relative frequency

where the independence assumption that inside the mixture p(xm , xp |k, q) = p(xm |k, q)p(xp |k, q)
(or p(xm |xp , k, q) = p(xm |k, q)) has been used.
The conditional distribution is a weighted and normalised (weights sum to unity) sum of the
individual factors p(xm |k, q). The weights depend on the prior probability of the mixture P (k|q)
(state dependent) in addition to the prior state probability P (q) and the probability of the present
data p(xp |k, q).
It is not immediately clear how to choose a point from this manifold. The “natural” criterion
maybe to choose the global maximum, as it is the most likely point. However, it can not be easily
determined. Another point of choice may be the conditional mean. It has an appealing property
that it minimises the quadratic error, and is easily computable:

The form is a weighed sum of the means of the missing components. The drawback is that if the
Gaussians are far apart and the distribution is multimodal, the mean may fall in a region of very
low probability. If, however, most of the Gaussians are “stacked” close together for the purpose
of approximating a non–Gaussian distribution which has few modes, imputing the mean maybe
appropriate.
The “imputed” missing observations ôm = Exm |op {xm } can be used instead of the noisy ones
om and subsequent recognition can continue with the “complete” data vector ô = (op , ôm ) instead
of o.

5.5.5

State dependent data imputation

When computing the emission probability for a state q it is assumed that the source is in that
state. Hence the state conditioned p.d.f. p(x|q) is used for computing the probability that the
observation was generated by that state. Analogous, if some of the observations are missing,
and it is assumed that the source us in state q, it maybe preferable to use the state conditioned
conditional data density p(xm |xp , q) instead of the conditional data density p(xm |xp ), for the
purpose of imputation. The form is similar but simpler then Eq. (5.20):
p(xm |xp , q) =

p(xm , xp |q)
p(xm , xp |q)
=R
p(xp |q)
p(xm , xp |q)dxm

(5.25)

Again taking into account that usually in a HMM based ASR system the state p.d.f.s p(x|q) are
mixtures of diagonal Gaussians (Eq. (5.12)), and considering the somewhat more general case of

is the responsibility of the k-th mixture for the present data xp .
Choosing a criterion for picking a single point from this function for imputation is again not
obvious. The highest mode (the global maximum) maybe most desirable (as the most likely
value), but it is not easily computable (Carreira-Perpiñán, 1999). Another choice is minimising
the quadratic error which implies using the conditional mean:

Again, if the Gaussians in the mixture are far apart and the state p.d.f. is multimodal, the mean
may fall in the region of very low probability, as shown on the upper panel of Fig. (5.3). However,

CHAPTER 5. ROBUST ASR WITH MISSING DATA IN AN HMM SYSTEM

79

if the Gaussians approximate possibly a non–Gaussian distribution which is not too multimodal,
the mean may be a good choice (as illustrated on the lower panel of Fig. (5.3)).
In both cases the global maximum is close to the means of the individual Gaussians. In the
upper panel of Fig. (5.3) (components far apart), it almost coincides with the highest mean in the
mixture. It in the lower panel of Fig. (5.3) (components stacked together), it is a bit further from
the highest mean. In any case, the means of the individual Gaussians may be a good starting point
for the search for the global maximum (Carreira-Perpiñán, 1999). But still, the global maximum
does not coincide with the “true value” all the time (just most of the time), so the reconstruction
is not from perfect.
After the ôm,q is computed, the emission probability of each state can be computed as p(ôm,q , op |q)
and the decoding can continue.

5.5.6

Marginalisation or imputation?

It is of interest to consider under which conditions one of the techniques is more preferable to the
other.
Marginalisation is computationally cheaper and there are no problems like the choice of criterion for picking a point on the conditional p.d.f. in the imputation. In our experiments the ASR
accuracy was always better with marginalisation then with imputation.
Imputation provides reconstruction of the unobserved data in addition to recognition. The
reconstruction task is not trivial. Many imputed values will give rise to the “correct likelihood”,
although only one is “correct”. While marginalisation effectively averages the likelihood over all
of the possible imputations (see Eq. (5.29)below), the imputation process has to pick only a single
value to be imputed. The fact that many other are also possible (if less probable) is disregarded.
Still, some non–HMM ASR systems may require complete(d) feature vectors because they can not
be adapted. Sometimes the adaptation is not trivial (as is the case with the hybrid ones), or the
recogniser is entirely separate subsystem treated like a “black box”. In that case imputation can
be the method of choice.
It is also possible to use both techniques in a complementary manner, if both recognition and
reconstruction are required: marginalisation can be used to obtain the most likely state sequence.
Once the sequence is known, the conditional state p.d.f.s may be used for imputation.
It seems that both techniques are somewhat dependent on the amount of data the mask “lets
in”. In the ASR experiments it was notable that for marginalisation it is better to impose a more
stringent assessment about the reliability of the features. While for imputation it was better to
loosen the criterion and treat more of the features as more reliable (compared to marginalisation).
It seems it is hard to impute sensibly the majority of the features in the vector if only small
minority of them are present. In the most extreme cases when where only couple of features are
present, it may be preferable to delete the whole frame altogether (frame deletion), rather then
trying to salvage it. The exact relationship between the data “quality” and “quantity” in the
context of robust ASR is not clear at present.
As mentioned in Section 3.3.2, there is an intuitive connection between the marginalisation of
the state conditioned p.d.f. p(xp , xm |q) and the imputation from the state conditioned conditional
distribution p(xm |xp , q). The marginal p(xp |q) can be considered an average over all possible conditional imputations p(xp |xm , q) weighted by their respective probabilities of occurrence p(xm |q):
Z
p(xp |q) = p(xp |xm , q)p(xm |q)dxm
(5.29)

5.5.7

Counterevidence

Although the missing observations om (t) were not generated by the speech source that is decoded,
they can still be used to derive information about which states are unlikely to have generated the
observations. This is an important constraint when no noise model is available. The commonly
used models of speech and noise mixing:

both imply that the values of the clean speech must be below the observed values of the noisy mixture. This can be used to score the states on how likely they are to have produced an observation
below om (t) (Holmes and Sedgwick, 1986; Cooke et al., 1994a; Green et al., 1995):

Additionally, in the log–spectral domain the energies should be positive, assuming that only
the compressive domain range [1, +∞) of the logarithm function is used. So a stricter:
Z om
p(xm |q)dxm
(5.31)
p(om |q) =
0

can be used.12 For imputation, bounding the marginal in the denominator of Eq. 5.26 and constraining the imputed values to fall within the range also improves the results (Cooke et al.,
2001).
The marginal p.d.f.s for xp and xm need not be computed separately. The additional knowledge
about the admissible range of xm can be utilised directly:

The assumption that Gaussians in the mixture are diagonal allows for the closed form solution.
In the case of non–diagonal Gaussians the integral in Eq. (5.32) doesn’t have a convenient
closed form solution. The covariance can be “diagonalised” with a suitable linear transform of the
variables of integration. But then the variables of integration appear in the bounds. So it is not
possible to decompose the multivariate integral into a form involving only one dimensional ones
(like in Eq. (5.33)). The solution has to be either approximated (as in Morris et al. (1998)) or
evaluated with Monte-Carlo type methods (Genz, 1992, 1993) which are unsuitable for ASR due
to computational constraints.13
Counterevidence with marginalisation
Using counterevidence with marginalisation is straightforward. Instead of p(o|m, q) = p(op |q)
(Eq. (5.11)) for the state p.d.f. of the HMM system, a more constrained:
p(o|m, q) = p(op , xm ∈ [0, om ])

(5.35)

is used.
Counterevidence with data imputation
Counterevidence can be used twice with data imputation (we will apply it only to state dependent
data imputation, Section 5.5.5).
Firstly, when the conditional p.d.f. is computed, instead of p(xm |xp , q) (Eq. (5.25)) we have:
p(xm |xp , xm ∈ [0, om ], q) =

p(xm , xp |q)
p(xp , xm ∈ [0, om ]|q)

(5.36)

The integral in the denominator becomes a bounded one taking into account the bounds constraint.
Secondly, when a point from the conditional p.d.f. above is drawn, it has to be in the [0, om ]
interval. Regardless of whether a mean or a mode is imputed, one has to consider the case when
the chosen point is not in the interval of [0, om ]. In our experiments (see Section 6.3.2) the highest
point among all Gaussians in the mixture that is within the bounds was chosen as a value to be
imputed.
The relative merits of evidence and counterevidence
There is an inherent problem in mixing the contributions of the present and the missing features
together: the former are likelihoods, i.e. points on the p.d.f. curve (and can take any value),
while the latter are true probabilities, i.e. points on the c.d.f. curve. If the mask is discrete (i.e.
probabilities of present and missing data p(m = 0) and p(m = 1) are either 0 or 1) the scores used
in the Viterbi search during the decoding need not be correct up to a scaling factor, as long as
13 the form is the same as one discussed in the Appendix C which arises in the case of a linear transform of the
feature vector

CHAPTER 5. ROBUST ASR WITH MISSING DATA IN AN HMM SYSTEM

82

the factor is the same for all states. The optimal path does not change when the likelihoods of all
states are scaled by the same factor. Hence using the curve (a) or (b) from Fig. (5.4) makes no
difference to the winning path if the mask is discrete . Even with non–discrete mask the difference
in the contributions of the counterevidence to different states is small.
Figure 5.4 plots an example of three different ways of mixing the evidence from the present
and missing data, together with the original Gaussian p(x|q). It’s notable that the shape of the
curves is virtually identical. The main difference is in the scores at high valued observations o
(disregarding the scaling factor between them). Curve (c) was found to perform poorer then (a)
and (b) in our experiments. Both (a) and (b) perform identically for ordinary Viterbi single–source
search. Barker et al. (2000) reported problems with (b) in the multisource decoder, as different
paths in this decoder see the data differently (as present or missing, with discrete mask). The
problem was circumvented by either using an empirically established scaling constant, or by using
the “average likelihood” (curve (a)).
The problem of the relative contributions of the present and missing data is a reminiscent of
the problem of using the acoustic and the language model in the ASR system together, when they
were estimated separately.14 The probabilities given by the acoustic model are overoptimistic,
most probably due to the assumption that the frames are independent. The “fudge factor” γ (in
addition to some other empirically derived parameters, like the word insertion penalty) is used as
in:
W ∗ = argmaxP (O|W )P (W )γ
(5.37)
W

instead of Eq. (5.1) to weight the relative contributions between the evidence from the acoustic
and the language models. These “adjustment factors” are usually tuned to minimise the word
error rate (WER) on a separate, “development” test set. Then their “optimal” values are used in
the final evaluation of the ASR system on a different “evaluation” test set.
If both the mask and the speech models are estimated jointly, then usage of such empirical
factors may be avoided. The average likelihood (a) maybe the safest choice for expressing the
counterevidence, as it at least keeps the score “dimensionally correct”, was shown to work well
in the multisource decoder (Barker et al., 2000) and doesn’t hinder the performance of the single
source Viterbi decoder as the “self–weighted likelihood” (c) does.

5.6

Summary

Techniques that cater for missing and unreliable data were integrated into an HMM based ASR
system in this chapter. The adaptation enables the system that models a single speech source
to handle observations that are a mixture of several sources. This is achieved without explicit
models for all of them, nor their decoding in parallel. The approach is inspired by the HSR which
seems able to attend to one source in the mixture alone, neglecting the others. The MD model for
speech recognition introduces the notion of a mask as a random variable, whose constraints can be
captured by an appropriate model. It is further discussed how marginalisation and data imputation
can be used to implement the adaptation of the speech HMM. The changes needed in the HMM
based system are fairly straightforward. The role of counterevidence and how it fits in an HMM
system is also explored. The implementation makes use of the function of acoustic environment
to circumvent the need for explicit noise models, while still capturing most of the constraints. It
also makes use of the special forms both of the speech and the mask model (factorisable or sum
of factorisable p.d.f.s) to achieve efficient computation of the mask conditioned likelihoods.

14 in addition, most often, when the acoustic model is estimated the wrong criterion is optimised: the likelihood
is maximised instead of minimising the word error rate

Introduction

The aim of this chapter is to present the results of the experiments with the Missing Data (MD)
ASR system. The connected digits task was chosen to test the techniques which is a de–facto
standard test for robust ASR. It has the advantage that whole word models suffice (there is no
need for phonetic dictionary) and there is no language model. Arguably, it is still a non–trivial
task, while leaving out components of the ASR system that have less influence on the robustness of
the system. The speech data was artificially contaminated with various noises at different SNRs.
The MD ASR system was an HMM based one, employing a textbook training procedures (Young
and Woodland, 1993) during models training and a textbook in–house Viterbi decoder during
the recognition (in several different implementations). The MD system was tested in various
configurations. The features were constrained to be in frequency domain, as the mask estimation
and recognition used the same features. The experiments included filterbanks (24 channels),
ratemaps (32 and 64 channels) both with or without the first derivatives. The mask estimation
in the experiments still makes use of a noise estimate. A weak noise model was estimated on–line
during the recognition. It was mostly stationary, i.e. constant for the duration of the utterance.
Apriori mask (which requires knowledge of the clean speech) was used to get an indication of the
performance that may be achieved with very good separation. Both marginalisation and data
imputation were tried for computing the likelihood of the partial data in the initial experiments.
In the latter set of experiments the marginalisation technique only was used, as it is faster and
data reconstruction was not required by the task.

6.2

Description of the MD ASR system and the corpora

An HMMs based ASR system in various configurations, adapted to handle missing and unreliable
data, was used for all experiments reported in this chapter. The system was trained and tested
on the TIdigits database (Leonard, 1984) mixed with Lynx helicopter and factory noise from the
NOISEX database (Varga et al., 1992), as well as TIdigits’ noisy variant Aurora 2 (Hirsch and
Pearce, 2000).
The TIdigits database consists of digit strings containing between one and seven digits (“1”
to “9”, “oh”, “zero”) recorded in quiet conditions and sampled at 20 kHz. The male and female
corpora (leaving out the digits strings spoken by children) were used together (no gender dependent
modelling) both for training and testing. The “canonical” TIdigits trainset (all clean speech) was
used for training.
Lynx helicopter noise from NOISEX was used as an example of stationary, and the factory
noise as an example of non–stationary noise. They were both added with random starting points
at SNRs from +20dB to -5dB to a subset of the TIdigits test set consisting of 240 digit strings
which were used for testing in the experiments with the NOISEX noises.
83

CHAPTER 6. EXPERIMENTS

84

The Aurora 2 database was used in the later set of experiments. It is based on the TIdigits
database. The TIdigits sentences have been downsampled from 20 kHz to 8kHz and various
distortions have been artificially added. The subset with additive noise contains speech mixed with
8 different noise types: suburban train, babble (crowd of people), car, exhibition hall, restaurant,
street, airport, train station. The noise signals were added at SNRs from 20 dB to -5 dB. They
all contain both stationary and non-stationary components to various degrees: from car noise
and exhibition hall which are mostly stationary, to street and airport noises which are very non–
stationary. The first four noises are used during the multiconditional training regime (training
with data contaminated with noise) for inferring noisy models. All eight noises feature in the
testing set. The first four noises form the subset testa; the last four form the subset testb.
The ASR system used was a “textbook” HMM based one. Each digit (“1” to “9”, “zero”
and “oh”) was modelled by a single “straight–through” HMM with “self” and “next” non–zero
transition only. The number of states was the same for all digits and varied from 8 for the
TIdigits+NOISEX experiments to 16 for the Aurora 2 experiments. Each state had a Gaussian
mixture p.d.f. with up to 10 Gaussians in the mixture. The grammar consisted of a silence
(represented with a single model) followed by any number of digits followed by silence. Occasionally
a distinction was made between the “long silence” on the beginning and the end of the sentences
and a “short”, interword silence.
The small vocabulary task of connected digits recognition1 was considered a convenient platform for exploration of the robustness aspects of the ASR. Arguably it is still a non–trivial task,
while the grammar is minimal and there is no need for a phonetic dictionary. The aim was to
reduce the impact of the components deemed unlikely to be the “core technology” of a robust
ASR system (phonetic dictionary, complex language model).
The system was trained using the HTK (Young and Woodland, 1993) in various versions (from
1.5 to 3.0). For testing an “in–house” vectorised Matlab based decoder was used for the former,
and the CASA toolkit (Barker, 2000) (CTK) for the later set of experiments.

Experiments with NOISEX factory and Lynx helicopter
noises

6.3.1

Speech/noise separation

The separation of the speech and noise in the time–frequency plane was accomplished by deriving
a mask m(t) (as described in Section 5.3). As every point is assumed to be either speech or noise
only, a (non–stationary) binary mask is enough to define the separation completely. Further text
will assume a notation where the a mask of mi (t) = 1 signals speech, while a mask of mi (t) = 0
signals noise (i being the frequency band). The noise and SNR estimation were carried out in
spectral magnitude domain, after the binning of the FFT magnitude and computing the magnitude
of the filters, but before the compressive non–linearity in the front–end.
Spectral Subtraction based masks (SS)
The spectral subtraction (SS) based masks were derived by assuming the points where the (non–
adaptive) spectral subtraction failed and ended with negative spectral magnitude, are noise (Drygajlo and El-Maliki, 1998a). All the other points were considered speech:
(
1 if si (t) + ni (t) ≥ n̂i ,
mi (t) =
(6.1)
0 otherwise,
where si (t) + ni (t) is the noisy speech feature i at time t, and n̂ is a stationary noise estimate
(constant over the duration of the whole utterance) computed as a mean of the first 10 frames in
the utterance.
1 Morris et al. (1998) have reported on Missing Data experiments on a medium vocabulary Resource Management
task with artificial random masks

CHAPTER 6. EXPERIMENTS

85

Signal-to-Noise Ratio based masks (SNR)
The noise n̂ was estimated as before, as a mean of the first 10 frames in the sentence. It was
further assumed that the speech and the noise are additive in the spectral magnitude domain.
These assumptions make thresholding of the SNR estimate possible (which is much more accurate
then the SNR estimate itself). The speech mask is computed as as:
(
T HR
1 if si (t) + ni (t) ≥ n̂i (1 + 10 20 ),
(6.2)
mi (t) =
0 otherwise,
where T HR is the threshold in [dB]. A threshold of T HR = 7dB was found to work well with a
range of SNRs, and the results were not too sensitive to the choice of this value.
Oracle/apriori masks (APR)
The oracle or apriori masks assume knowledge of the clean speech s(t). It is further assumed that
the speech and noise are additive in the spectral magnitude domain. With those assumptions in
hand it is possible compute the apriori SNR estimate2 and/or to threshold it. The speech mask
was obtained as:
(
−T HR
1 if si (t) + ni (t) < si (t)(1 + 10 20 ),
mi (t) =
(6.3)
0 otherwise.
Again a threshold of T HR = 7dB was found to work well with a range of SNRs.

6.3.2

Computing the likelihood of the partially observed data

Computing the likelihood of the partially observed data (see Section 5.5) p(o(t)|m(t), q(t), W ) is
all that is needed to adapt an HMM system (trained on non–censored data) to handle the partial
data. The system was used both with marginalisation and imputation of the missing data. The
following techniques were tried:
Marginalisation (MG)
Marginalisation of the missing data:
p(o(t)|m(t), q(t), W ) = p(op (t)|q(t), W )

(6.4)

where p(op (t)|q(t), W ) is computed as in Eq. (5.19). With the diagonal GMM state p.d.f.s used
this amounts to disregarding the missing features.
It was further noted that if a noise estimate is available (e.g. with SS or SNR masks), subtracting the noise slightly improves the accuracy.
Bounded marginalisation (BMG)
Marginalisation of the missing data while taking into account the counter–evidence constraint:
p(o(t)|m(t), q(t), W ) = p(op (t), xm (t) ∈ [0, om ]|q(t), W )

(6.5)

(Eq. (5.35)) where p(op (t), xm (t) ∈ [0, om ]|q(t), W ) is computed as in Eqs. (5.32) and (5.33). With
the diagonal GMM state p.d.f.s used for each missing feature xi (t) the area beneath the p.d.f. and
between 0 and oi (t) is computed.
2 the SNR is still estimate – although the speech s is known, it is still an assumption that the speech and noise
are additive in the particular domain

CHAPTER 6. EXPERIMENTS

86

State–based data imputation (SDI)
Imputation of the missing features by drawing a point from the conditional state p.d.f.:
p(xm (t)|op (t), q(t)) =

p(xm (t), op (t)|q(t))
p(op (t)|q(t))

(6.6)

In all experiments with SDI the mean of the p.d.f. was computed:
ôm (t) = Exm |op (t),q(t) {xm }

(6.7)

as in Eq. (5.26) and all subsequent processing was on the vector (xp (t), ôm (t)) which has no data
missing.
In every time frame the possible imputations of all states are computed. Hence there are as
many versions of the frame as there are states. During the emission probability calculation, for
each state only the likelihood of the feature vector with xm ’s filled from the p.d.f. of the same
state is computed i.e. p(op (t), ôm (t)|q(t)).
Bounded state–based data imputation (BSDI)
Imputation of the missing features by drawing a point from the conditional state p.d.f. constrained
in the range of [0, o(t)] (see Section 5.5.7). Firstly the conditional state p.d.f. was computed as:
p(xm |op (t), xm ∈ [0, om (t)], q(t)) =

p(xm , op (t)|q(t))
p(op (t), xm ∈ [0, om (t)]|q(t))

(6.8)

as in Eq. (5.36).
Secondly, a point from the conditional p.d.f. was chosen as ôm (t). It was noted that in
most cases the Gaussians in the mixture were far away in at least one dimension, resulting in
a multimodal conditional p.d.f. For each Gaussian in the mixture, the point with the highest
density that is within the bounds [0, om (t)] was chosen as a possible candidate for ôm (t). Then
among all points the one with the highest overall posterior probability (i.e. taking into account
the “responsibilities” together with the likelihood) was chosen as value for ôm (t). All subsequent
processing was on the “completed” vector (xp (t), ôm (t)).

6.3.3

Results with 64 channel ratemap features

The acoustic vectors consisted of smooth outputs of from 64–channel auditory filter bank (centre
frequencies spaced linearly in ERB scale from 50 to 8000Hz), computed every 10ms (Cooke, 1991).
HTK (Young and Woodland, 1993) was used for training, and a local MATLAB decoder for
recognition. Twelve models (’1’–’9’, ’oh’, ’zero’ and ’silence’) consisting of 8 no–skip, straight–
through states with observations modelled with a 10 component diagonal Gaussian mixture were
trained on clean speech. Stationary Lynx helicopter noise as well as non–stationary factory noise
from the NOISEX database was added (with random start points) at SNRs from +20dB to -5dB
to a subset of the TIdigits test set consisting of 240 digit strings used for testing. In all graphs,
the X-axis is the SNR, decreasing from clean, 20 dB, to -5 dB in 5 dB steps, while the Y-axis
depicts the recognition accuracy. In all cases the factory noise proved to be a harder task due to
its non–stationarity.
Masks based on spectral subtraction
The purpose of the experiment was to check whether treating the points where SS failed as missing
would produce any improvements over SS alone.
Figures 6.1, 6.2 and 6.3 depict the results on factory noise. Figures 6.4, 6.5 and 6.6 depict the
results on Lynx helicopter noise.

In all cases a discrete non–stationary SS mask was derived. The baseline and the SS curve are
the accuracy of the recogniser without any compensation and with spectral subtraction respectively. The noise estimate for SS was the same one as for deriving the SS mask.
Figures 6.1 and 6.4 show the results of the marginalisation (MG) and the bounded marginalisation (BMG) technique. Figures 6.2 and 6.5 show the results of state based data imputation (SDI)
and bounded SDI (BSDI). In all cases treating the points where SS failed as missing improves the
results. Further, using the bounds constraint gives slight, but consistent advantage.
Figures 6.3 and 6.6 compare the improvements between the bounded marginalisation and state
based data imputation. For factory noise they are mostly the same, with BSDI performing only
slightly better at 10 dB. For Lynx helicopter noise, it seams BSDI outperforms BMG at all SNRs.
Masks based on local SNR estimation
Figures 6.7, 6.8 and 6.9 depict the results on factory noise. Figures 6.10, 6.11 and 6.12 depict the
results on Lynx helicopter noise.
In all cases a discrete non–stationary SNR mask was derived with a 7 dB threshold. The
baseline and the SS curve are the accuracy of the recogniser without any compensation and with
spectral subtraction respectively. The noise estimate for SS was the same one as for deriving the
SNR mask.
Figures 6.7 and 6.10 show the results of the marginalisation (MG) and the bounded marginalisation (BMG) technique. Figures 6.8 and 6.11 show the results of state based data imputation
(SDI) and bounded SDI (BSDI). In both cases when no bounds are used (MG and SDI) the accuracy suffers at mid to high SNRs and both perform worse then SS. They do perform better then
SS at low SNRs. It was noted that in both cases a major source of errors are random insertions
in frames where there is little or no data at all (all features in the frame are noisy). Introducing
the bounds both with marginalisation (BMG) and state based data imputation (BSDI) rectifies
this, as bounds make the silence model win in the quiet frames where the speech was swamped
by noise. The accuracy is improved, and both BMG and BSDI outperform SS significantly at all
SNRs.
Figures 6.9 and 6.12 compare the improvements between the bounded marginalisation and
state based data imputation. Both for factory noise and Lynx helicopter noise, BMG seems to
outperform BSDI at all SNRs. It seems that the SNR masks, which let less but more reliable data
in (compared to the SS masks) suit marginalisation better, while SS masks (letting more, but less
reliable data) suit data imputation better (see Figure 5.2 for masks example).
Apriori masks
The apriori masks are derived from the clean and noisy speech (as described on pp. 85). They
are indicative of the performance that may be achieved with very good separation. They are also
useful in assessing the performance of different methods for computing the likelihood of the partial
data independently of the separation front–end.
Figures 6.13, 6.14 and 6.15 depict the results on factory noise. Figures 6.16, 6.17 and 6.18
depict the results on Lynx helicopter noise.
In all cases a discrete non–stationary APR mask was derived, with an estimated SNR threshold of 18 dB. The baseline and the SS curve are the accuracy of the recogniser without any
compensation and with spectral subtraction respectively, and are plotted as indication only.
Figures 6.13 and 6.16 show the results of the marginalisation (MG) and the bounded marginalisation (BMG) technique. Figures 6.14 and 6.17 show the results of state based data imputation
(SDI) and bounded SDI (BSDI). The trends are mostly similar to the ones observed with SNR
mask (previous section). In both cases when no bounds are used (MG and SDI) the accuracy
suffers at mid to high SNRs. The drop is most dramatic with MG – accuracy decreasing sharply
when going from clean speech to 20dB, then staying mostly flat down to low SNRs. As noted
before, a major source of errors are random insertions in the frames where there is little or no data
at all. This is even more pronounced with APR masks (compared to SNR masks). Introducing

the bounds both with marginalisation (BMG) and state based data imputation (BSDI) rectifies
this, as bounds make the silence model win in the quiet frames where the speech was swamped by
noise. The accuracy improves at all SNRs and with both noises.
Figures 6.15 and 6.18 compare the improvements between the bounded marginalisation and
state based data imputation. Both for factory noise and Lynx helicopter noise, BMG seems to
outperform BSDI at all SNRs. As discussed in Section 5.5.6, imputation seems a harder task then
marginalisation, as speech reconstruction is attempted, in addition to computing the likelihood of
the partial data.
Apriori mask threshold
The apriori masks are derived from the clean and noisy speech, and are indicative of the performance that may be achieved with very good separation. Figures 6.19, 6.20, 6.21 and 6.22 show
the sensitivity to the choice of a threshold value for ratemap features.
Figures 6.19 and 6.20 depict the results on factory noise. Figures 6.21 and 6.22 depict the
results on Lynx helicopter noise.
In all cases a discrete non–stationary APR mask was derived by comparing the clean and the
noisy speech. APR18 stands for SNR threshold of 18.27 dB (clean and noisy speech differ 1 dB
or less). APR8 stands for SNR threshold of 7.69 dB (clean and noisy speech differ 3dB or less).
APR0 stands for SNR threshold of 0.04dB (clean and noisy speech differ 6dB or less).
Figures 6.19 and 6.21 show that both with factory and Lynx noise, MG is slightly better off
with a higher threshold of 18.27 dB then a lower one of 7.69 dB. The opposite, but to a greater
degree, is true for BMG: BMG is better off with a lower threshold of 7.69 dB then a larger one
of 18.27 dB, and the difference is more pronounced. This may be due to the imposition of the
additional constraint – the bounds. Lacking this constraint, MG is more sensitive to noisy data
getting through the mask. Whereas BMG is able to cope with more data, even it is of lesser
quality.
Results for data imputation on Figures 6.20 and (6.22) are more consistent. Letting more
data in (APR8 v.s. APR18) helps accuracy both with SDI and BSDI. Using bounds always
improves accuracy at the same threshold. Data imputation, compared to marginalisation, seems
more sensitive to lack of data then it is to its noisiness – using an even lower threshold of 0.04 dB
(APR0 on Figure 6.20) increases the accuracy further.
However, the improvement seems to depend on the mask quality. Using similar thresholds with
SNR (“real”) masks does not lead to improved results there.

6.3.4

Results with 24 channel filterbank features

The experimental setup was similar as in the previous Section 6.3.3. The only difference was that
the acoustic vectors consisted of 24 channel Mel-spaced triangular filterbank outputs (Young and
Woodland, 1993) computed every 10ms.
Masks based on local SNR estimation
Figures 6.23, 6.24 and 6.25 depict the results on factory noise. Figures 6.26, 6.27 and 6.28 depict
the results on Lynx helicopter noise.
In all cases a discrete non–stationary SNR mask was derived with a 7 dB threshold. The
baseline and the SS curve are the accuracy of the recogniser without any compensation and with
spectral subtraction respectively. The noise estimate for SS was the same one as for deriving the
SNR mask.
All results largely mirror what has already been observed with SNR masks with 64–channel
ratemap features.
Figures 6.23 and 6.26 show the results of the marginalisation (MG) and the bounded marginalisation (BMG) technique. Figures 6.24 and 6.27 show the results of state based data imputation

(SDI) and bounded SDI (BSDI). In both cases when no bounds are used (MG and SDI) the accuracy suffers at mid to high SNRs and both perform worse then SS. The do perform better then
SS at low SNRs. As previously noted, this is mostly due to random insertions in the frames where
there is little or no data. Introducing the bounds both with marginalisation (BMG) and state
based data imputation (BSDI) rectifies this, as bounds make the silence model win in the quiet
frames where the speech was swamped by noise. The accuracy is improved, and both BMG and
BSDI outperform SS significantly at all SNRs.
Figures 6.25 and 6.28 compare the improvements between the bounded marginalisation and
state based data imputation. Both for factory noise and Lynx helicopter noise, BMG seems to
outperform BSDI at all SNRs.
Apriori masks
As previously noted, the apriori masks are derived from the clean and noisy speech. They are
indicative of the performance that may be achieved with very good separation. They are also useful
in assessing the performance of different methods for computing the likelihood of the partial data
independently of the separation front–end. The baseline and the SS curve are the accuracy of the
recogniser without any compensation and with spectral subtraction respectively, and are plotted
as indication only.
Figures 6.29, 6.30 and 6.31 depict the results on factory noise. Figures 6.32, 6.33 and 6.34
depict the results on Lynx helicopter noise.
Comparing the results with the APR masks on 64–channel ratemap features, it is notable that
the threshold of 18.27 dB is not used anymore. With only 24 features (instead of 64), there isn’t
enough data left for ASR with such a stringent criterion for data quality. Thresholds of 7.69 dB
(APR8) and 0.04 dB (APR0) were compared in various conditions and using the different MD
techniques.
Figures 6.29 and 6.32 show the results of the marginalisation (MG) and the bounded marginalisation (BMG) technique. With both noises, the performance of the both techniques is better with
the more stringent criterion. It seems that for marginalisation it’s better to let less, but more
reliable data in. Figures 6.30 and 6.33 show the results of state based data imputation (SDI) and
bounded SDI (BSDI). Here, the opposite (compared to MG and BMG) seems to hold: letting
more, but less reliable data in helps improving the accuracy (with the exception of SDI on Lynx
noise).
Figures 6.31 and 6.34 compare the four techniques (MG, BMG, SDI, BSDI) at their best SNR
threshold. As expected, using the bounds constraint improves the accuracy significantly. Also,
BMG seems to consistently outperform BSDI, while MG is worse than SDI at higher SNRs and
better at lower ones.
The trends in the results are mostly in line with the previously observed results on 64–channel
ratemap features, with the notable exception of using a lower threshold (in general) with 24–
channel filterbank features.
Using “cleaned” (clean) models
Figure 6.35 depicts the results on factory, and Figure 6.36 on Lynx helicopter noise, with models
trained on clean speech that has been processed with SS. The stationary noise estimate was
obtained as the mean of the first 10 frames of each sentence, and was subsequently subtracted.
Although clean speech was used for training, the benefit of the process is that the models “learn”
some of the artifacts introduced by the “cleaning process” (that is going to be used during testing
latter) during training. These models are referred to as “cleaned models”, whereas the models
obtained by training on unprocessed clean speech are “clean models”.
On both noises, SS with “cleaned models” (SScl) was compared with SS (with “clean models”),
and so was bounded marginalisation (BMGcl) with SNR mask. In both noises SScl performs better
then SS at all but the lowest SNRs. BMGcl outperforms BMG by a smaller margin, but from
a higher baseline. It seems that this commonly used technique for improving the performance

Average log-likelihood of the best path
Considering the large difference in accuracy when using APR masks compared to using “real”,
SNR masks, it was of interest to get an insight to the likelihood of the best path in both cases.
Figure 6.37 depicts the average log–likelihood (averaged over the 240 test sentences) of the best
path (the ASR’s best result) with three different masks. Along the Y–axis is the log–likelihood,
while the SNR decreasing from clean speech, to 20 dB, to -5 dB in 5 dB steps is on the X–axis.
Bounded marginalisation on the noisy data (BMGn), with no noise estimate subtracted from the
noisy speech, was used. The contributions of the missing features to the likelihood were divided by
the range om (t) − 0 = om (t), to yield the “average likelihood” (see Section 5.5.7 and Figure 5.4).
APR and SNR masks are computed as before. The Maximum Likelihood Mask (MLM) is
computed by comparing the contribution to the likelihood (of the the vector) by each feature:
how much does a feature contribute when it is present, and how much when it is missing. The

Figure 6.38: Accuracy with iterative mask refinement on factory noise (24–channel filterbank

larger of the two values is taken and that determines whether the feature is present or missing.
This is done on a per–state basis, as each state has different p.d.f. used to compute the likelihood
of the observation vector. After the recognition has finished, the best path is backtracked and
finally determines the MLM mask used. In a sense, the MLM mask maximises the local acoustic
evidence for each individual state.
The difference in accuracy between the APR and SNR masks carries over in the log–likelihood
domain: the average log–likelihood of the best path with APR mask is considerably greater then
with SNR mask at all SNRs. This raises the possibility of using the acoustic likelihoods as guides
during mask creation (speech/noise separation). The average log–likelihood of the best path with
MLM mask is indeed much larger then with SNR mask. But it is also larger then when APR
masks are used. And the accuracy of the best path with MLM mask is much worse then with SNR
(and APR) masks (not shown). Investigation of the MLM masks showed that although giving rise
to best paths with high likelihoods, the masks themselves were very unlikely. The present and
missing features in the mask were finely dispersed over the whole T–F plane, without any of the
grouping apparent in the APR masks.
Using MLM mask effectively locally maximises the partial likelihood P (O|M, Q∗ , W ) from
Eq. (5.2), without taking into account the likelihood of the mask itself P (M |Q∗ , W ) when computing the “best path”3 W ∗ . If a suitable mask model P (M |Q∗ , W ) penalised the very unlikely
MLM mask, the accuracy of the best path with MLM would probably correlate to its log–likelihood,
as is the case with SNR and APR masks.
Iterative mask refinement
Starting with a SNR mask, the mask was iteratively refined by cycling through recognition (alignment) and (most likely) mask reestimation. In each iteration the state alignment of the best
path was obtained. Having one state corresponding to each frame, the p.d.f. of that particular
state was used to infer the most likely mask for that frame alone. As in the previous section, the
feature was considered to be present if its likelihood was greater then its “average likelihood” (see
Section 5.5.7). Otherwise, it was considered missing. Once a new mask was obtained, the best
path with that mask was computed. This path was used in the next iteration, etc. The iterative
process was aborted if the likelihood of the best path did not increase sufficiently.

marginalisation on noisy data (BMGn). The accuracy is compared to the one of using the initial
SNR mask alone (SNR+BMGn). There is some improvement at mid SNRs, but it is questionable if it is enough to justify manifold increase in computational cost (compared to improvements
achievable with other means).

6.3.5

Results with 24 channel filterbank features with their first derivatives

In this set of experiments, the 24–channel filterbank features were supplemented by their temporal
derivatives approximations, yielding 48 feature vectors. The temporal derivatives were approximated with the “standard” expression (Furui, 1986):
PN
j=−N j · xi (t + j)
∆xi (t) =
(6.9)
PN
2
j=−N j
with N = 2.
The problem with MD ASR is that some of the xi (t + j) for j = −N . . . N features may be
missing. One solution is to treat the derivative ∆xi (t) as missing if any of the features xi (t + j),
j = −N . . . N needed to compute ∆xi (t) are missing (the strict mask), as depicted in Figure 6.39.
If the missing mask pattern was random, this would create a very sparse mask for the derivatives.
However, in the experiments with speech and noise this is not the case. The reliable features tend
to be clustered into T–F blocks, so the sparsity of the derivative mask is not much greater than
that of the features mask.
It was also noted that when strict masks were used with bounded marginalisation and data
imputation, the bounds on the derivatives were so wide that they made little difference (at a great
computational cost). Hence in all experiments (unless noted otherwise) the contribution of the
missing derivatives to the likelihood were disregarded, effectively turning BMG into MG and BSDI
into SDI as far as the derivatives were concerned.
Strict SNR and APR masks
Figures 6.40 and 6.41 depict the results with strict SNR masks (SNRst) on factory and Lynx noise
respectively. Figures 6.42 and 6.43 depict the results with strict APR masks (APRst) on factory
and Lynx noise respectively.
All figures contain results with spectral subtraction (SS) and Mel–cepstral features (MFCC),
without or with Cepstral Mean Normalisation (MFCC+CMN) as well. For the latter 13 cepstral
features were extracted from the 24 filterbank outputs via Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) (Young
and Woodland, 1993). For MFCC+CMN, the mean (on a per–sentence basis) of each feature was
subtracted from it. Then, their first and second derivatives were appended to the feature vector
yielding 39 features for each vector.
MD techniques tested were bounded marginalisation (BMG) and bounded state based imputation on noisy data (BSDIn). It was found that with first derivatives, the data imputation technique
is very sensitive to the disturbances introduced to the derivatives due to the subtraction of the
noise estimate. Hence the noisy data was used for imputation.

With both noises both MD techniques outperform both the spectral subtraction and the cepstral features (with and without mean normalisation) at almost all SNRs. The only exception is
BSDI performing worse then SS and MFCC at high SNRs (clean and 20 dB) on factory noise.
Again, BMG performs better then BSDI at all SNRs and on both noises.
Therefore, with APRst masks (Figures 6.42 and 6.43) only the results with bounded marginalisation are shown. The apriori masks are not “true” masks, as they are derived by knowing the
clean (in addition to the noisy) speech. However, they are indicative of what can be achieved with
very good speech/noise separation. The results are very tempting: accuracy of around 90% (a bit
more for Lynx, a but less for factory noise) at -5 dB. It seems that these results point firmly to poor
mask quality of SNRst masks as the major reason for poor performance (compared to the usage
of APRst masks). They also may indicate that major improvements are unlikely to come from
using some new technique for estimation of the partial likelihood. Rather, major improvements
maybe expected with better masks estimation.
“Common” ASR system tuning techniques
Figures 6.44 and 6.45 show the effects on using some common ASR tuning techniques on the
recognition accuracy on factory and Lynx helicopter noise.
The baseline MD ASR system (BMG) was tested with strict SNR (SNRst) and apriori (APRst)
masks. The improved system (BMG++) consisted of the following:
• tuned word insertion penalty
• additional, short interword silence
• rudimentary language modelling – it was noted that no sentence contained both the “zero”
and “oh” models, hence transcriptions mixing both in the same sentence were rejected during
testing
Figure 6.44 shows that on factory noise there is small but notable improvement, which is more
pronounced with SNRst mask then with APRst mask. On Lynx helicopter noise (Figure 6.45),
the results with SNRst mask are mixed, and the improvement with APRst mask is smaller.

Bounding the missing derivatives
Figure 6.46 shows the effects of using bounds on the missing derivatives in the strict mask on
factory noise, while Figure 6.47 depicts the same for Lynx helicopter noise. In both cases the
“improved system” from the previous section is the baseline.
The bounds on the missing derivatives were computed by knowing the bounds on the missing
“static” features (used to compute the derivative) and the way the “static” features are used to
compute the derivative (Eq. (6.9)).
The results for both noises are consistent. If the mask is accurate (e.g. APRst mask), then
bounding the derivatives does help at lower SNRs (only slightly, but the baseline is already quite
high). Whereas when the mask is not accurate (e.g. SNRst mask), the benefit of using bounds
is wiped out by them being not accurate in significant number of cases. Therefore, there is little
incentive in using the bounds on he derivatives when the bounds are unreliable.
“Standard” techniques for improving ASR system’s robustness
As an indication of what is possible with some “standard” robustness technique, Figures 6.48
and 6.49 depict the accuracy with Mel cepstral features (MFCC) with and without Cepstral
mean normalisation (subtraction) (CMN) on factory and Lynx helicopter noise respectively. The
results with spectral subtraction on 24–channel filterbanks with their first derivatives are also
shown. These two techniques were chosen as they are the most representative of the currently
used techniques for improving the robustness of an ASR system.
The system was exactly the same, and trained and tested on exactly the same data as the one
using the MD techniques.
It seems that MFCC features are inherently more robust and they outperform SS both with
and without CMN on both noises.

Experiments on the Aurora 2 database

As described in Section 6.2, the Aurora 2 database (Hirsch and Pearce, 2000) is a noisy and
downsampled version of the TIdigits database (Leonard, 1984).
For this set of experiments, 32–channel ratemaps (Cooke, 1991) were used as features in the
MD ASR system. After the experiments with 64–channel ratemaps and 24–channel filterbanks (in

the previous sections), the features and their number was chosen as a compromise between two
opposing aims that frequency domain based features need to provide to an MD ASR system:
• fine enough frequency resolution for the purpose of mask estimation
• coarse enough frequency resolution so that speaker/pitch dependent harmonics are not resolved (but only the envelope of the short–term spectrum is sampled)
Ratemaps also provide some smoothing (that Mel–scaled filterbanks lack) making the assumption
that speech and noise are additive in power spectral domain (used to derive the estimated SNR
after the noise estimation) more viable. Their first order derivatives (Eq. (6.9)) were appended to
the ratemaps to form a 64–element feature vector. An appropriate strict mask was used for the
derivatives.
Previously used methods for mask estimation assumed a mask with probability of unity, i.e. no
attempt was made to estimate the factor P (M |Q∗ , W ) from Eq. (5.2) when estimating the mask.
The probability of all possible masks other then the estimated one was set to 0. Hence the sum
For the experiments on Aurora 2, two methods that associate certain probability with each mask
were tested. The following two sections will outline the techniques employed.

6.4.1

Soft/fuzzy SNR mask (SNRSoft)

With the soft (fuzzy) SNR masks, the probability of each point being speech was expressed by
suitable mapping of the estimated SNR. Hence the term soft/fuzzy – instead of thresholding the
SNR (as with the SNR masks), each point in the mask gets an associated probability. The mapping
was accomplished via a sigmoid function:
P (mi (t) = 1) =

1
1 + e−α(SNˆ Ri (t)−β)

(6.10)

ˆ R was computed as for the SNR masks. The centre β and the slope α
The local SNR estimate SN
of the sigmoid were chosen empirically to achieve best result on the Aurora 2 testa, noise1 subset
(Subway noise). The same parameters were used across both test subsets (testa and testb) and
across all noises.

Adaptive noise tracking (SNRA)

The adaptive noise tracking scheme consists of tracking both the noise mean and variance. It is
assumed that the distribution of the noise is Normal, and that the noise features are independent.
The first 10 frames of each utterance were used for initial estimates of the noise mean and variance.
Then, each feature oi (t) in the incoming frame o(t) was scored on how likely is that it was generated
from the noise distribution estimated in that channel so far. This was accomplished by thresholding
the probability of an SNR being less then a SNR threshold. In the experiments reported in the next
ˆ Ri (t) < −7dB) > 0.6 the feature oi (t) was considered to have been generated by
section, if P (SN
the noise source. Therefore it was used to recursively adapt the noise mean and variance estimates.
ˆ Ri (t) < X) with threshold X in dB was computed as

for the spectral data. The recursive update of the mean µi (t) and the variance Σi (t) (independently
for each feature/channel) was:
µi (t + 1) =
si (t + 1) =
Σi (t + 1) =

αµi (t) + (1 − α)oi
αsi (t) + (1 − α)o2i
si (t + 1) − µi (t + 1)

(6.12)

with α = 0.995.
Once a noise estimate was obtained, an SNR estimate was obtained by assuming that the
speech and the noise are additive in the spectral magnitude domain (resulting in the noisy speech
magnitude) at all times.
The probability of belonging to the speech/noise source was subsequently computed from the
local SNR. For clean models the SNR threshold was fixed at 7 dB, i.e. the probability of each
point in the T–F plane being speech was computed as:
ˆ Ri (t) > 7dB)
P (mi (t) = 1) = P (SN

(6.13)

This results in a mask that has very few, but reliable points. For noisy models it was found that
it is preferable to use a lower threshold of 0 dB instead of 7 dB. This less stringent assessment of
the speech quality results in more points considered more likely to be speech.
This probability can be used in the “soft” MD computation instead of the sigmoid from the
previous subsection. The advantage of SNRA seems to be that while the centre β and the slope
α of the sigmoid (mapping the SNR estimate into a reliability estimate) are somewhat noise
dependent, we haven’t observed the same with the threshold X and the “forgetting factor” α of
ˆ Ri (t) < X)
SNRA. The disadvantage is the computational cost. Assuming that computing P (SN
is comparable to sigmoid evaluation, the computational cost of SNRA is at least twice the one of
the sigmoid mapping.
ˆ Ri (t) > XdB) is simply
If a discrete mask is needed, the probability P (mi (t) = 1) = P (SN
thresholded to provide binary speech/noise discrimination.

6.4.3

Computing the state likelihood with fuzzy masks

Since each point in the mask is treated being independent of the rest, and the state p.d.f.s are
sums of factorisable p.d.f.s, Eq. (5.8) can be used to efficiently calculate the sum over all possible
masks in Eq. (5.2):
X
Y
P (o(t)|q(t), W ) =
P (k) [pi (oi (t)|k, mi (t) = 0, q ∗ (t), W )p(mi (t) = 0|q ∗ (t), W )
(6.14)
i
k
+ pi (oi (t)|k, mi (t) = 1, q ∗ (t), W )p(mi (t) = 0|q ∗ (t), W )]
The contribution of the present and missing features to the likelihood is weighted by the probability
of them being present or missing, which is provided by the fuzzy mask.

Results with discrete and fuzzy strict SNR masks

Figures 6.50, 6.51, 6.52 and 6.53 depict the results on the four noises from Aurora 2 testa test set.
Figures 6.54, 6.55, 6.56 and 6.57 depict the results on the four noises from Aurora 2 testb test set.
The “clean baseline” results are the baseline results with MFCC features and models trained
on the clean portion of the database. It is set by the rules of the Aurora 2 competition. Similarly,
the “multi baseline” results are the baseline results with MFCC features and models trained on
the noisy portion of the database.
The bounded marginalisation (BMG) was tested with strict discrete SNR masks (SNRst) as
well as with strict fuzzy SNR masks (SNRstSoft). In both cases it outperforms the “clean baseline”
in all conditions. Estimating the mask probability, even crudely as with SNRstSoft, considerably
improves the BMG results. In all cases the “multiconditional baseline” (models trained on noisy
speech) performs best.
Figure 6.50 contains an additional result with discrete apriori mask (APRst). It is interesting
to compare that to the “multi baseline” result, as:
• using data contaminated with noise for training is often considered the upper limit on what
can be achieved with various noise robustness techniques (e.g. various models adaptation
techniques)
• using apriori masks can be indicative of the upper limit of what can be achieved with the
MD approach to robust ASR
Both methods provide comparable performance at high SNRs. But for mid and low SNRs, the
“multiconditional training” rapidly deteriorates, while BMG with APRst masks steadily holds
onto the performance.

6.4.5

Results with adaptive noise tracking

Figures 6.58, 6.59, 6.60 and 6.61 depict the results on the four noises from Aurora 2 testa test set.
Figures 6.62, 6.63, 6.64 and 6.65 depict the results on the four noises from Aurora 2 testb test set.
As before, the “clean baseline” results are the baseline results with MFCC features and models
trained on the clean portion of the database, and fixed the rules of the Aurora 2 competition.
Similarly, the “multi baseline” results are the baseline results with MFCC features and models
trained on the noisy portion of the database.
The models used for the experiments were trained on the noisy portion of the Aurora 2
database. The adaptive noise estimation had a threshold of 0 dB for assessing the probability
of the mask.
Bounded marginalisation (BMG) was tested with strict fuzzy SNRA masks (SNRAstSoft)
and strict discrete APR masks (APRst). Using SNRAstSoft masks and noisy models makes the
MD results comparable with the multiconditional baseline. Bounded marginalisation in this case
performs the same with the multiconditional baseline at high SNRs, slightly better for some noises
and worse for others on mid SNRs, and always significantly better at low SNRs.
The clean baseline and marginalisation with apriori masks are also plotted for indication.
Bounded marginalisation with apriori masks (APRst) performs surprisingly well even at the lowest
SNR, where very few reliable speech points are available.
The main advantage of the fuzzy SNRA masks over discrete SNR masks seems to be the
fuzziness, rather then the adaptation. SNRA masks, when used as discrete masks (by thresholding
the probability estimate) behave only marginally better then discrete SNR masks.

6.4.6

Token dependent noise estimation

Figure 6.66 depicts the results with “token dependent noise estimate” (TDNE) on the Aurora
2 testa noise1 subset (Subway noise). 24–Channel filterbank features together with their first
derivatives were used.

The TDNE scheme is connected to the “token passing” scheme (Young et al., 1989) for performing dynamic Viterbi search during ASR. Briefly, the scheme assumes an imagined “token”
exists in every state of the speech models. Each token carries its path and the likelihood of the
data it has “seen” so far. Every time frame, the token from every state is propagated into all
admissible subsequent states and has its path and likelihood score updated. Next, for every state,
only the token with the highest score is kept while the rest are discarded. The process is repeated
until there is data available. Tokens in the “last” states of every model are compared, and the
most likely among them is the winner.
In TDNE, each token carries a noise estimate in addition to the other data (path, likelihood
score). Tokens propagated through silence model(s) have their noise estimates updated. When
computing the frame likelihood, each token, having separate noise estimate, gets different mask
(and maybe speech) estimate. The scheme was employed with the standard bounded marginalisation technique. For the dynamic features the static mask was used as well, as computing the
strict mask as before requires knowledge not only of the static masks in the past frames, but the
future frames as well, which are not available.4
As shown on Figure 6.66, using SNRst mask derived with TDNE does improve the accuracy
over the standard SNR mask (which uses stationary noise estimate) at all but the highest and the
lowest SNRs.

6.5

Summary of the experimental results

Two series of experiments were carried out on two noisy versions of the same data (TIdigits). The
MD techniques were used in conjunction with masks provided by separation that relies on noise
estimation. The MD techniques themselves do not call for noise estimation. However, at the time
the experiments were done, no functioning CASA system was available for masks creation.
In the first series, the data was contaminated with two noises: factory (non–stationary) and
Lynx helicopter (stationary). The main conclusions are:
• Both BMG and BSDI perform better then SS with the same noise estimate.
• MG and SDI both suffer from random insertions when there is little data present in a frame.
SDI is more suspect to this problem, as it has to recover the missing data from the present
4 this can be overcome by shifting the derivatives N frames back, i.e.

data and the speech models. Using bounds (BMG and BSDI) solves that problem.
• Marginalisation (MG and BMG) is more accurate then imputation (SDI and BSDI). The
data can be imputed after it is Viterbi aligned with the models using BMG.
• Using cleaned models gives only slight improvement (both for MD and SS).
• Using standard deltas with strict mask provides improvement; the missing deltas need not
be bounded, but simply marginalised.
• Using soft masks brings big improvement.
In the second series of experiments, the Aurora 2 noisy database was used. Several points can
be made regarding the Aurora 2 graphs:
• MD with noisy models and adaptive noise tracking performs as good as or better then the
baseline with the noisy models - same or slightly worse at high SNRs and better at low
SNRs. It should be noted that the filterbank models used in MD have baseline worse then
the Aurora 2 MFCC baseline. So the adaptive noise estimation with MD recovers some of
that loss.
• MD with clean models and with stationary noise estimate performs significantly better then
the clean MFCCs based baseline. This is expected as the baseline doesn’t take into account
the noise at all, neither during training nor during testing.
• MD with apriori masks shows the potential of the technique with an extremely good/perfect
mask. The results are surprisingly good even at low SNRs and the accuracy doesn’t plunge
catastrophically.
• The apriori masks results clearly point that the deficiencies in the MD approach at present
are not of poor speech modelling, but of poor identification of the speech components in the
noisy speech. Therefore the huge performance gap between the realistic mask estimates and
the apriori mask at low SNRs can be addressed by improving the identification of the speech
in noise and therefore the mask.5
• Adaptive noise estimation and similar techniques for noise tracking are somewhat more
effective then stationary noise estimation. However, not only do they introduce more complex
processing (their computational cost is negligible compared to the rest of the system), but
also rely on tunable parameters which need to be optimised by trial and error.

6.6

Summary

Results of the recognition experiments using an MD HMM system were presented in this chapter.
A “standard”/textbook HMM system, adapted suitably to handle the MD, was employed on a
connected digits task. The speech was artificially contaminated with noise at SNRs from -5 dB to
20 dB. Clean speech was also used for testing. MD ASR was tried with different features (although
all constrained to be frequency domain features) and with and without their first derivatives. For
mask estimation, couple of techniques based on local SNR estimation were employed. They rely
on noise estimation. We mostly made use of simplest forms of noise estimation, and with purpose.
MD techniques don’t need noise estimation if there is another process (see Chapter 4) that can
produce the mask. However, in absence of widely available, computationally cheap and easily
reproducible methods for speech/noise identification (separation) we had to make use of noise
5 This is consistent with the results with and without voice activity detection, and in general with the approaches
taken in most of the noise reduction algorithms. These algorithms are knowledge driven and rely on the gross speech
features (harmonics, continuity, simultaneous transitions, onsets and offsets across frequency bands) which have
already been singled out in the (C)ASA community as features significant for speech separation (or identification
of the speech portions in a noise mixture).

estimation in order to do the experiments. Further, we saw how adding even a crude probabilistic
treatment to the mask brings improvements over a simple assumption that the particular mask
used is the only possible one. Both marginalisation and data imputation were tested as methods
for computing the likelihood of the partial data vectors. Toward the end (i.e. for the experiments
on the Aurora 2 database) only marginalisation was used as it was always computationally cheaper
and usually more accurate then data imputation. The results on the Aurora 2 database are directly
comparable to other published results on the same, standardised database of noisy data. We think
that even with the simple mask estimation techniques employed here, the MD ASR system does
perform competitively. Further, the results with apriori masks point that improving the separation
part in the MD chain is bound to bring most benefit to improving the accuracy.

Chapter 7

Discussion
7.1

Introduction

In this chapter the relation of MD techniques with other approaches to robust ASR which touch
either or both the separation and the recognition parts of a robust system will be discussed
first. Some Frequently Asked Questions about MD techniques will be answered next. Several
possibilities open for further research, the unresolved problems and unknowns will also get a
mention. The chapter (and the thesis) closes with the main conclusions that we have drawn from
this work.

7.2

Relation to other approaches to robust ASR

The missing data techniques discussed throughout this text are related to different extents to
several known techniques. Some take the ”missing data” idea further (e.g. multisource decoding),
others have arrived at the same techniques spurred by different motivation (e.g. masking), and still
others have utilised all-or-nothing separation motivated by nothing more then sound signal processing principles (e.g. MAX approximation of the compressive nonlinearity) and were attracted
by the simplicity that makes the computations trackable (HMM decomposition).

7.2.1

Multisource decoder by Barker, Cooke, and Ellis (2000, 2001a)

The multisource decoder (Barker et al., 2000, 2001a) takes MD techniques a step further, insofar
that it relaxes the requirements on the separation frontend. Not only does it allow for arbitrary
groupings of features in the time frequency (T–F) plane, but it doesn’t need to label which ones are
speech, and which ones are noise. It allows for the both possibilities, forking two decoders when
it encounters a start of a new patch (a group of T–F points coming from the same source). Both
decoders continue to decode in parallel the same patch of data. One of the forked decoders assumes
that the patch belonged to the noise source and decodes using the BMG technique (Section 6.3.2).
The other decoder assumes that the patch was generated by the speech source. All points that
do not belong to that patch are treated the same by both decoders. At the end of the patch, the
decoders are merged. For each state of every model the higher of the two scores (resulting from
the data assumed to be speech and noise) is kept. If during the decoding of the patch the start of
a new patch is encountered, each of the decoders forks two new ones, etc.
This amounts to a simultaneous search both for the ML path Q∗ and the ML mask M ∗
(from Chapter 5). In (Barker et al., 2000) the mask is initially based on local SNR estimate
(Section 6.3.1). Then it is subsequently broken in coherent fragments – patches – such that:
• the neighbouring present points belong to the same patch
• the patches are broken at the edges of the four arbitrarily chosen frequency bands

Figure 7.1: Local SNR derived mask (top); The mask decomposed into coloured coherent fragments
– whole patches containing only speech or only noise (middle); The mask giving the ML word
sequence after the decoding (bottom). The figure was kindly supplied by Jon Barker.
This a precursor to “schema driven grouping”. Barker et al. (2001a) make a step in that direction:
a voicing detector is used to split the patches further into parts containing harmonic energy and
the others containing in–harmonic energy. Further, an adaptive noise estimate which assigns
probability to each point is used to create the initial “soft” SNR masks (Section 6.4.1).
It is worth stressing again that the grouping process that creates the patches does not label
them as speech or noise. After the decoding of the data has finished, the best path is backtracked
and only then the mask giving rise to that path is established. The grouping is completed together
with the decoding.
At present no patches overlap (each point in the T–F plane belongs to one patch only), and
the “grouping process” does not associate probability estimates with the patches (“how likely it
is that a group of points in the T–F plane were generated by a same source“).1
Figure 7.1 depicts the original mask on the top panel. It was derived with stationary noise
estimation followed by local SNR estimation and thresholding (Section 6.3.1). The noise is artificial
diagonal chirps. The mask is broken into patches shown in the same colour on the middle panel.
Each patch is either speech or noise exclusively. During the decoding, the decoders examine both
hypotheses, and only the more likely is retained when the decoders merge at the end of a patch.
After the decoding, the patches belonging to the recognised sequence are backtracked and shown
on the bottom panel. The multisource decoding improves the accuracy of the MD ASR with non–
stationary noise and at low SNRs (Barker et al., 2001a). The improvement seems proportional to
the non–stationarity of the noise.
The four–bands break-up of the initial mask was chosen empirically. It seems that making
the fragments smaller2 hinders the performance.3 This is reminiscent of MLM (previous chapter,
pp. 101): choosing the feature to be present or missing solely to maximise local state likelihood
alone leads to highly likely (Q∗ , W ∗ ) (higher then the Q∗ of the correct model W ) but poor accu1 although the “soft” mask assigns some probability to whether the point is speech or noise, this is unrelated to
the bottom–up (BU) constraints suspected of restricting which points can locally be grouped together as coming
from the same source

racy. The reason may be that although the resulting mask M 0 gives rise to high P (O|M 0 , Q∗ , W ),
the probability of the mask itself P (M 0 |Q∗ , W ) is very low. A particular collection of points may
give rise to high likelihood (of some model), but it is unlikely that the points in the collection
alone were generated by a single source.
Developing models that will capture the BU constraints of which points can be grouped together
seems to promise improvement of the ASR performance in non–stationary noise.

7.2.2

Multistream and multiband approaches to ASR

The multistream approach to ASR is based on combining several streams of evidence (Bourlard
et al., 1996). The streams of evidence can be recombined at certain points, synchronously (the
easier case) or asynchronously (harder, and with tenuous advantage over the synchronous case).
With this architecture, it’s easy to envisage integration of evidence coming from different types of
features on different time scales, and/or from different sources and/or modalities. For example,
Dupont and Bourlard (1997) combined evidence from short (10ms, phoneme) and longer (200ms,
syllable level) term features in a context of a hybrid system.
A special case of the multistream approach is the multiband approach (Bourlard et al., 1996;
Hagen et al., 1998; Cerisara et al., 1998; McCourt et al., 1998; Sarikaya and Gowdy, 1998; Hagen
et al., 2000). The separate streams are (critical) bands of a filterbank. All acoustic processing is
performed independently in each subband. This results in as many streams of features as there
are subbands. They or their scores can be further combined in a final classifier. For example,
Tibrewala and Hermansky (1998) extracted all pole PLP features independently (across bands)
from the filterbank energies of seven separate bands (each spanning across two critical bands), and
then recombined the (context independent) phone posteriors synchronously via a recombination
network. Okawa et al. (1998) merged all the features in a single vector and classified using that
huge feature vector alone.
There are several reasons in favour of the multistream approach:
• Allen (1994)’s review of the work of Fletcher about the intelligibility of low and high–pass
filtered speech seems to suggest that humans process speech in more or less independent
bands. The so called “product of error“ rule (a conjecture that probability of human hearing
making error is a product of the error rates in the individual bands) can be accounted for
by this model.
• Per–band feature modelling (typically all–pole) should give more accurate models simply
due to less variation present when each band is treated in isolation.
• Different recognition strategies may be more effective in different bands. For example, different windows and time/frequency trade–off for different bands.
• Allowing asynchrony between the bands may lessen some of the constraints of the current
models. Mirghafori and Morgan (1998) tested the assumption that transitions between the
sounds in the natural speech occur asynchronously across the bands. The findings seem to
suggest that a significant number of transitions (about one third) occur more then 50ms apart
from each other in different bands, with high frequency bands timings spread dependent on
the speaking rate.
• It seems no significant phonetic information is lost due to independent processing in each
band (Mirghafori and Morgan, 1998).
With regards to the problem of robustness in ASR, the multiband approach is particularly
suited to band limited noise. As long as the noise leaves some bands unaffected, there is enough
information in the remaining bands for ASR.
The multiband approach has interesting connection to missing data–once the garbled bands are
identified, in the recombination stage all evidence coming from that band is completely disregarded.
This is akin to marginalisation of the unreliable features. However, the hybrid ASR systems (most

CHAPTER 7. DISCUSSION

120

often used in multistream/multiband ASR) trained on clean speech and with no data missing can
not be easily adapted to handle partial evidence (see Section 3.4.2). Therefore as many recognisers
need to be trained (with parts of the spectrum missing) as there are possible combinations of
missing/present bands (Hagen et al., 1998, 2000). This clearly limits the number of possible
streams of evidence that can be used and this number is rarely greater then seven.

7.2.3

“Bounded masking” by Holmes and Sedgwick (1986)

Holmes and Sedgwick (1986) work is an early precursor of one of the techniques presented in
this thesis. Starting with different motivation (modelling the effects of masking in noisy speech),
a technique which is essentially the bounded marginalisation (Chapter 6.3.2) is developed and
applied both to a Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) as well as an HMM recogniser. This work is
pioneering in several other respects. For example, it stresses the importance of keeping the noise
which is localised in the T–F plane local in the further stages of processing (i.e. using spectral
filterbanks rather then LPC coefficients).4 After some study, de Veth et al. (1999) conclude the
same a decade latter. Holmes and Sedgwick (1986) further give a recipe of training with noisy
data, and advise on the perils of relying on quiet parts of the spectrum that may be swamped
with noise later.
However, the work is in the context of noise masking and does not go any further than that.
There is no notion of a general binary mask that (economically) separates the speech and the
noise. Nor that it may be formed by enforcing the BU constraints to group patches of points in
the T–F plane that come from the same source.

7.2.4

HMM decomposition by Varga and Moore (1990)

Varga and Moore (1990) introduced the HMM decomposition method (reviewed in Section 2.8.2)
as a means of decoding multiple sources from a single sequence of observations. Like the work
presented here, they also use spectral features and assume that the MAX operator combines the
speech and the noise observations into noisy ones. Most often the number of sources is limited to
2 (as the size of the search space increases exponentially with the number of sources) with one of
the sources being the speech source, while the other is the noise source.
This is a general method for combining any sources of variability in an observed signal, provided
that the way they combine to yield the observation is known. An N–dimensional Viterbi search
(N being the number of sources) is used to find the most likely sequence of states in the joint
state–space.
The main differences of the approach compared to the MD work presented here are:
• HMM decompositions decodes all speech sources even if one of them only is of interest. It
provides a complete solution. But usually the sequence of states some of the sources went
through (e.g. the noise source) is of little interest.5 In decomposition’s terms, MD ignores
the noise by assuming that in the missing points all values of the noise (and hence the speech)
are equally likely between 0 and the noisy observation.
• When applied to recognising of speech in noise6 , it is assumed that the noise model brings
valuable constraints to the decoding process. However, the sources are independent. Their
state transition probabilities are independent. Their only interaction is through the environmental function (MAX in this case). MD’s assumptions in composition’s terms would be
equivalent to a noise model which:
4 even experienced researchers sometimes get surprised how similar the spectrograms of e.g. 0dB SNR look like
to the spectrogram of the corresponding clean speech (with all the important speech structures clearly visible),
while the difference in WERs the contemporary ASR systems achieve is stark
5 it is possible to SUM (as opposed to MAX) the paths in the dimensions of the sources that aren’t of interest;
averaging over the possible states for the not–of–interest–sources may bring increased accuracy
6 model decomposition is a general technique, and it has also been applied to recognition and separation of
simultaneous multi–speech

– has as many states as frames, with the probability of the transition between successive
states 1 while the rest of the transition probabilities are 0
– state dependent continuous probability density function which: for the noise points
assigns equal probability of 1/o to the noise values between 0 and the observed value o,
and 0 out of this interval; for the speech points it assumes the noise was 0 with absolute
certainty (the distributions is a Dirac delta function)
Whether one considers a prior noise model to be stronger (more constrained) then the one
equivalent to the MD assumptions, may depend on what is deemed “noise”. To the “speech
technologist” noise is mostly synonymous with “not speech”. In the “hearing community” the
term seems more specific: a sound with no discernible structure is noise – the rest are sounds.7
When considered in its stricter sense (the latter case), noise should bring large variance, and
hence weak constraints. When considered in the wider sense (the former case) the noise model
may bring constraints not captured by the MD model.8
The advantages of decomposition seem proportional to the amount of structure in the interfering sounds. For sounds of weak structure the properties of the speech alone may be enough
to guide the separation. For example, Hirsch and Pearce (2000) reported on noisy training with
speech mixed with 4 noises, and testing on the same 4 noises as well as 4 other, unseen noises.
The differences in performance on the seen and the unseen noises was very small.
To bridge the gap of orders of magnitude between HSR and ASR in a real life environment,
both approaches (with MD augmented with models capturing the BU constraints) may need to
be applied in concert.
Integrated models of signal and background by Rose, Hofstetter, and Reynolds (1994)
Rose, Hofstetter, and Reynolds (1994) extend Varga and Moore (1990)’s work and treat the
problem of merging any two (or more) discrete state–space models in a combined model in its full
generality. Environmental functions other then MAX, and different feature domains (and how they
influence the choice of the mixing function) are considered. The specifics of the MD model (MAX
function, compressed spectral features) correspond to the special case of HMM decomposition
discussed above.

Frequently Asked Questions

7.3.1

Is mask estimation just another name for noise estimation?

Mask estimation can be achieved through noise estimation, followed by local SNR estimation, as
presented in this work. But it is not limited to it.
Mask estimation can also be accomplished via CASA. However limited in their utility, the
CASA systems built over the past couple of decades are proof of a concept that separation using
the properties of the speech alone is achievable. This is the important assumption for any practical
application.
It is also worth repeating that the motivation for using a binary mask is not just an assumption
of convenience. The principle of exclusive allocation (a point in a T–F plane is either speech or
noise, without any go–betweens) is not advocated for any domain other than compressed spectral
features. Choosing the mask as an interface between the separation and the recognition part of
the system is not only supported by what we know about human hearing, but has already been
utilised in computational models both for recognition (HMM decomposition) and separation (Wu
et al., 1998a).
7 e.g. a roaring bus passing nearby is noise to the former, or another sound in the auditory scene to the latter
8 it seems the two communities treat the sounds that have prominent structure along the frequency axis only
(significantly change along the frequency axis, but not in time) of the T-F plane (e.g. “coloured noise”)

CHAPTER 7. DISCUSSION

122

The CASA systems built so far have been mostly knowledge based, rather then statistical.
Their drawbacks are typical of that approach, have prevented their further development, and are
reminiscent of the drawbacks of the ASR systems that predated the current statistical ones:
• complex models, not really trainable on a large corpus of data
• difficulty reconciling multiple, and sometimes conflicting, sources of evidence
with the added
• impossible to integrate with ASR systems, apart from being an entirely independent frontend
However, these drawbacks can be tackled successfully (as was the case with the ASR systems)
in a data driven system. Work toward learning what is speech from the data has been reported
recently. Ris (2000) trained a neural network to estimate the posterior probability of the mask
given the noisy data. Seltzer, Raj, and Stern (2000) trained a multivariate Gaussian classifier
to assess the probability of a feature being present or missing. Brown, Wang, and Barker (2001)
integrated a connectionist CASA system with missing data ASR. All attempts reported significant
performance improvements.

7.3.2

Can acoustic evidence alone guide the separation?

When the non–speech features are matched with speech models, they typically fall in very low
density regions. These points are known as outliers. When some speech state during the Viterbi
search produces an extremely low score, every path passing through it will have an extremely low
score. The acoustic back–off technique (de Veth et al., 1998) allocates a minimal constant probability mass for every observation, limiting how low a score can become. The UNION model (Ming
et al., 2000) models the speech vectors p.d.f. with a form that is a sum of products. Consequently,
the products containing outliers are very small and contribute little to the sum. Similarly, the
full combination multiband approach (Hagen et al., 1998, 2000) sums the acoustic evidence over
all possible combinations of present/missing data in every frame and relies on outliers to cancel
themselves out in the sum.
These methods seem to be more beneficial for artificial then real noises. They suffer from
common problems:
• patches of realistic noise will match some speech states; hence noise may not always result
in an outlier9
• all possible combinations of the reliable features are weighted equally, as if all possible masks
M have the same probability P (M |Q, W )
The experiment with the MLM (pp. 101) points to the limitations of using the ASR acoustic
models to select features as speech or non–speech. It seems that the speech models capture a
set of constraints different then the ones pertinent to the BU grouping. So, while all the above
referenced work uses some of the ideas that motivated the MD work presented here (exclusive
allocation, localised disturbance of the features) in various ways, other ideas, maybe important
for increased robustness (mainly regarding the separation part of an integrated ASR–separation
system), are omitted from consideration.

7.3.3

What about convolutional noise?

The MD work presented here is entirely concerned with additive noise only. We have no reasons to
believe that the principle of disjoint allocation of energy (central to the MD techniques) is true for
convolutional noise. On the contrary, a limited test carried out on test C of the Aurora 2 database
(containing artificially induced convolutional noise) suggest that MD techniques as presented here
9 stated p.d.f. p(x|q) models the speech source only; we have no reason to assume anything about the joint
speech–noise p.d.f. p(xp , xm |q)

CHAPTER 7. DISCUSSION

123

are not suitable for convolutional noise. Using the apriori masks, it was found that the speech
models, rather then mask estimation, are to blame. Spectral domain features are susceptible to
the spectral tilt introduced by the convolutional noise. The models expect energy in the wrong
frequency bins and perform poorly even at high SNRs and apriori mask.

7.4

Problems with the MD model for ASR

7.4.1

Mask estimation

The identification of the speech regions is the main problem at present. The apriori oracle masks
indicate that the principal gap between the achievable and achieved performance is due to poor
mask estimation. In this work a stationary (in the former) and adaptive (in the latter set of
experiments) noise estimation was used. Recently it was augmented by harmonicity based CASA
as well as apriori 4–band mask grouping in the multisource decoder (Section 7.2.1). The problem
of separating the speech from the rest of the auditory scene even in simple acoustic environments
remains challenging.

7.4.2

Merging the likelihoods during MD Viterbi search

It is not completely clear what is the best way to merge the likelihoods resulting from paths with
different masks. This problem does not arise in the “single source” Viterbi search, as all paths
“see” the same data. However, it does arise in the context of the multisource decoder. Dividing
the probability mass from the missing features by the range of integration to yield an “average
likelihood” (for the assumed noise model) has been used so far. But the problem re–emerges
when dealing with any features that need to be marginalised completely as no bounds are known,
and carry no information whatsoever about the source (e.g. when missing delta features without
bounds).

7.4.3

Choice of features for separation and recognition

Separation (and noise estimation) usually require frequency domain features. For example, good
frequency resolution is necessary for on–line noise estimation. In contrast, ASR models are generally better–off with features that contain information about the gross vocal tract shape only
(spectral envelope) – not the fine spectrum. At present, the former set of features is converted to
the latter by frequency axis warping, compression, projection on cosine basis and truncation (Mel–
frequency cepstral coefficients, MFCCs). The nature of the transform path makes the merger of
the separation and recognition techniques difficult. The noise which is localised in the T–F plane,
in which the principle of disjoint allocation of energy holds (after the compression), is spread
over every cepstral coefficient.10 Spectral features are correlated and need more Gaussians in the
models to capture those correlations (compared to MFCCs). Subtracting the channel dependent
long term component of the spectrum also seems somewhat less effective then cepstral subtraction
for channel normalisation. The truncation of the cepstral coefficients (typically, only the first 12
out of 24 are retained) also provides a certain resilience to noise (especially at high SNRs). More
fundamentally, separation makes use of speech features (like F0 ) which are speaker dependent,
while the recognition subsystem needs as speaker independent features as possible.
10 it was also argued that the whole conversion path is altogether prone to side effects that diminish the discrim-

inability between the vowels when the pitch increases (de Cheveigne and Kawahara, 1999); it seems that sampling
the short spectrum at the harmonics of the fundamental F0 provides information about the gross spectral shape
and is not affected by the pitch change

Future work

7.5.1

Data driven masks models

124

It was already noted in Section 7.3.1 that it seems probable that further gains in robust ASR will
come from data driven separation models, which are computationally trackable and trainable on
a large corpus of data. The data needed can be easily generated as apriori masks. It would be
advantageous if such techniques not only single out the most probable mask, but also produce a
probability distribution for all possible masks.
For example, one possibility is to infer a state dependent model for the apriori (before any
data is seen)11 distribution P (M |Q, W ) of the apriori masks. Training data can be produced from
state force aligned speech and apriori masks. This is akin to Viterbi (rather then Baum–Welch)
training, as every state is assigned
a pool

may be used for modelling (Carreirai,k (1 − µi,k )
Perpiñán and Renals, 2000). While this above may capture some of the apriori probability of a
mask, ultimately features osep pertinent to the separation process will need to be used in a mask
model P (M |Osep , Q).

7.5.2

Coupling separation and recognition for better models

Speech separation/enhancement researchers tend to use a simple speech model, while ASR researchers tend to assume a simple environmental model. Usually, the former model the speech
source as static, without time structure. While the latter assume that the convolutional noise
is constant and that additive noise is slowly changing. It maybe beneficial to reconsider the
trade–offs in both cases. For example, Acero, Altschuler, and Wu (2000) reported on using both
a more complex environmental and speech model. The usual obstacle is that the ASR features
are in domain where separation model becomes complicated, without closed form solutions. The
autoregressive (AR) speech models (Logan, 1998) may be one possible compromise.

7.5.3

A speculation on an integrated speech separation and recognition
model

Model (de)composition, with the speech along X, the mask along Y , and the time along Z axis is
used to tie the separation and recognition parts of the system together. For the purposes of mask
estimation, the source can be in several states. For each “separation state” qY either:
• a separate algorithm for identification of a particular cue thought to be important for BU
grouping is applied (e.g. identification of harmonics, onsets, offsets, common modulation,
etc)12
or
• the states are purely a modelling tool to achieve a better mask model, with no explicit
relation to the auditory grouping cues13
Models and topology
Both speech and mask models are HMMs. The speech model is a straight–through standard speech
HMM with states qX with a distribution of p(o|m, qX ), where m is a binary mask. The mask
HMM is a “noise–like” HMM with interconnected
states qY , each with a probability distribution

for a joint Gaussian distribution for the continuous observations and Bernoulli distribution for the
discrete mask. This distribution is different from p(o|m, qX ) in that it expresses the probability
of any speech, not a particular sound in the language.
Features
Features o are compressed FFT magnitude or auditory filterbank features with fine spectral resolution. For the speech states the p.d.f. is p(o|m, qX ) (not mere p(o|qX )) and most of the points
are usually missing. The feature vector has many more dimensions then usual for recognition,
hence:
• MG (pp. 85), instead of BMG (pp. 85) is used to match the evidence, with the counterevidence ignored
or
• the evaluation is computationally intensive
Using the features this way solves the problems of: (a) choice of different features for separation
and recognition; (b) decorrelation; and (c) sampling the envelope of the spectrum instead of its
fine structure.14
Training
The parameters of the speech model are inferred separately from the mask model using clean
speech. The mask model is inferred from noisy speech and apriori masks. Or both are inferred
simultaneously, with a joint–estimation scheme similar to the ones presented by Kadirkamanathan
and Varga (1991), Roweis (2000) and Graciarena (2000).

Conclusions

Current ASR systems, although still lagging far behind HSR, perform well enough for many applications in a controlled environment. However, in a less restricted environment desirable for many
applications, their performance degrades dramatically rendering them unusable. The lack of robustness has been identified as the most significant limitation of the current technology (Sagayama
and Kiyoami, 1997).
The present systems assume first and foremost a single source. Attempts to accommodate the
basic design for multiple sources during the Aurora 2 competition seem to suggest that:
• Even training with noisy data (multiconditional baseline) when the noise is known in advance
does not achieve the performance needed for many applications.16
• The performance gains achieved are mainly due to:
– frame deletion – frames considered too noisy are discarded
– cleaning of the noisy speech via algorithms that use the gross speech features (e.g.
harmonicity) to discriminate between the speech and the noise
Regarding the first point, the techniques presented here offer possible gains which exceed what is
currently possible with matched training, as demonstrated with the apriori oracle masks (pp. 112–
113).
With regards to the second point, using the “ideal” filter (the apriori masks) demonstrates
that it is not the faulty models that cause the performance loss. But rather feeding the models
non–speech when they expect speech is the main reason for degradation.
The problem of lack of robustness seems to be one of separation, rather than of poor speech
modelling. The only untapped source of constraints at the moment appear to be the BU constraints
pertinent to “grouping”, as discussed in Chapter 4. On its part, the ASR backend can make the
task of the separation frontend easier by foregoing full speech spectrum reconstruction. Merely
identifying the speech parts in a sounds mixture should suffice for the ASR backend.
In this work we have experimented with some aspects of a possible system that may implement
these ideas. We believe to have demonstrated that:
• The hard problem of ASR of speech in noise can be separated into two subproblems –
speech identification and recognition of the partial speech. Treating the mask that binds
both subsystems as a random variable opens opportunities to tackle the mask estimation
problem.
• Using the partial spectrum for recognition is good enough for ASR not only with artificial,
but also with realistic noises. Hence an enhancement frontend which reconstructs the whole
spectrum is not necessary.
16 a probable application of the connected digits task is phone dialling by voice; the target sentence error rate
(SER) is about 3%, which requires WER of about 0.3%

CHAPTER 7. DISCUSSION

127

• However, if needed for a particular application (e.g. speech enhancement), the missing parts
of the spectrum can be reconstructed during the decoding in a principled way and employing
a strong speech model (as provided by the recogniser) for this purpose.
• Further gains in robust ASR at mid and low SNRs are achievable through better modelling
of the identification/separation frontend of the system.
• Tapping into the BU constraints by devising appropriate features for the “cues” and modelling them accordingly is likely to lead to better recognition accuracy in less controlled
environments.
In the end, several commonly held assumptions (Peters et al., 1999)17 about how humans and
machines hear may need to be revisited if machines are to approach human hearing in its resilience

Lets consider a single unit with two inputs x1 and x2 , corresponding weights w1 and w2 and

The multidimensional integral of a sigmoid transfer function can be analytically expressed as
a sum of polilogarithms of the same order. Every additional unknown input xi integrated over
the bounds [ai , bi ], raises the dimensionality of the integral by one, which consequently doubles
the number of terms in the sum of polilogarithm functions and also raises by one the order of the
functions in the sum. For example, for three dimensional integral we get:

Appendix C

Linear transformation of the
missing features
The idea that parts of the spectrum are unaffected by noise and can be used alone, ignoring ones
contaminated with noise, assumes that the subsequent pattern matching is performed in the same
domain as the identification of the reliable features. However, it is of interest to consider what
happens if the features undergo a linear transform before the pattern matching phase. This is often
the case in the contemporary ASR systems. The systems utilise the envelope of some spectral
representation, rather then spectral representation itself. The spectral envelope is much more
speaker and pitch independent, while allowing speech discrimination. It is also advantageous
to use a transform that approximately decorrelates the features, thus reducing the number of
Gaussians in the mixture needed to accurately model the correlations between the features in the
state p.d.f.s1 . The Discrete Cosine Transform (Rao and Yip, 1990) is routinely used with the
speech signal to achieve both.
Lets assume that the spectral feature vector x undergoes a linear transform Cx before being
used in the state likelihood computation Eq. (5.12). The contribution of each individual Gaussian
to the likelihood (with conditioning on the state and mixture dropped) is:
p(x) = N (Cx; µ, Σ) =

1
(2π)k/2 |Σ|1/2

T

e− 2 (Cx−µ) Σ

(C.1)

where Σ is diagonal, and C is a linear transform matrix with dimensionality k x (p + m) (p is the
number of
R present, and m the number of missing features). The aim is to compute the marginal
p(xp ) = p(x)dxm .
With suitable reordering of the rows of x and columns of C we have:

(C.2)

where xp and xm are vectors with dimensions p and m respectively and Cp and Cm are matrices of
k x p and k x m elements respectively. The quadratic form in the exponent of Eq. (C.1) becomes:
(Cx − µ)T Σ−1 (Cx − µ)

= (Cm xm + Cp xp − µ)T Σ−1 (Cm xm + Cp xp − µ)

If xm is unbounded the integral above is indefinite and vanishes (evaluates to 1). Note that the
contributions of the known features xp are also absent from the remaining form (being absorbed
#
in µ1 = −Cm
(Cp xp − µ)). This is unsatisfactory, but expected – a linear combination of a known
and unknown values can take any value in (−∞, ∞).
If the integral is definite with a rectangular hyper-volume of integration, it can not be evaluated
T −1
Σ Cm is a non diagonal
conveniently. The covariance matrix Σ1 is not diagonal (as Cm in Cm
matrix), preventing factorisation of the p.d.f. and evaluation of the multidimensional integral as a
product of one dimensional integrals. Numerical methods that evaluate the integral by sampling
the space do exist (see Genz (1993) and references therein; the lower and higher bounds on the
integral from Eq. (C.4) decompose to a difference of multivariate normal probabilities). But they
can hardly be considered suitable in the context of an HMM system where the probability in
Eq. (C.4) is calculated for every frame and for every state.

Appendix D

Efficient calculation of the
likelihood of the MD model with
factorisable probability functions
The missing data model for speech recognition (Section 5.3) depends on summation of the partial
likelihood over all possible masks, weighed by their respective probability (Eqs. 5.2 and 5.3, pp. 69):
X
W ∗ ≈ argmax
P (O|M, Q∗ , W )P (M |Q∗ , W )P (Q∗ |W )P (W )
(D.1)
W

or

all M

W ∗ ≈ argmax
W

X

P (O|M, Q∗ , W )P (Q∗ |W )P (M |W )P (W )

(D.2)

all M

Under the i.i.d. assumptions the probabilities of the sequence of vectors decompose into products
of the individual vectors probabilities. Still, it is not clear how to efficiently calculate the weighted
sum over all possible masks in every time frame.
Fortunately, if both p(o(t)|m(t), q ∗ (t), W ) and P (m(t)|q ∗ (t), W ) (or P (m(t)|W )) are factorisable or weighted sums of factorisable distributions, an efficient calculation of the sum over all
masks is possible. Lets consider the case when the state p.d.f. p(o(t)|m(t), q ∗ (t), W ) is a weighted
sum of product of factors (ex: a mixture of Gaussians with diagonal covariance matrices) and
P (m(t)|q ∗ (t), W ) (or P (m(t)|W )) is factorisable probability distribution function:
X
X
Y
p(o(t)|m(t), q ∗ (t), W ) =
P (k)p(o(t)|k, m(t), q ∗ (t), W ) =
P (k)
pi (oi (t)|k, mi (t), q ∗ (t), W )
k

k

i

where k indexes the mixture components, while i indexes the features in the feature vector. The
mask can take only two values, 0 and 1 (0 meaning the respective feature is missing, 1 the feature
is present):
Y
P (m(t)|q ∗ (t), W ) =
Pi (mi (t)|q ∗ (t), W )
i

(the second variant with the mask M in P (M |W ) dependent on the model, but not the state on
the path is analogous)
Bernoulli (Carreira-Perpiñán and Renals, 2000) distributed mask probability:
Y m (t)
P (m(t)|q ∗ (t), W ) =
µi|qi∗ (t),W (1 − µi|q∗ (t),W )mi (t)
i

is one possible distribution satisfying the assumptions above.

137

APPENDIX D. EFFICIENT SUMMATION OVER ALL MASKS

138

Lets denote (dropping the conditioning on state and word, and disregarding the time index t):
αk = P (k),
aki = pi (oi (t)|k, mi (t) = 1, q ∗ (t), W ),
bki = pi (oi (t)|k, mi (t) = 0, q ∗ (t), W ) and
ri = pi (mi (t) = 1|q ∗ (t), W )
(consequently 1 − ri = pi (mi (t) = 0|q ∗ (t), W ) )

The sum is as convenient as it is intuitive: the sum of the data likelihoods over all possible
masks weighted by the probability of each mask can be computed using the sum of the individual
features likelihoods, each weighted by the probability of being present or missing. The assumptions
used are that both the data likelihood and the mask likelihood are weighted sums of factorisable
distributions. They are observed in a typical HMM system.

Attributions
The work reported in this thesis has been done in collaboration with several members of the
Speech and Hearing Group (SPandH) in the Department of Computer Science at the Sheffield
University, UK, during the course of several years. A. Morris did a lot of the earlier work on
missing data ASR. A. Vizinho was instrumental in the work on separation using local SNR based
estimation. M. Cooke was the first to realise that the large number of insertions appearing in the
frames with little reliable data can be solved by using bounded marginalisation instead of mere
marginalisation. He also suggested a mask reliability measure derived from the local SNR estimate
via a sigmoid mapping. J. Barker not only provided the tools (the CTK) for the latter set of the
experiments, but also verified many of the results via separate and independent experiments. P.
Green was also fully involved in all aspects of the work reported in this thesis.

# Theme 1: Personal Finance & Investing
<a id="theme-1"></a>

LJ reflects on both personal investing and macro-level finance. He notes how higher interest rates redistribute value — commercial banks profit and wealth holders benefit from rolling over government debt — and points to the Bank of England’s role in the system. He argues the state should build assets to generate passive income rather than rely solely on income tax. Personally, he emphasizes starting to invest early and regrets selling Apple stock in 2010.

## Executive Intro
Compounding rewards patience while policy sets the field of play. Understand how rate regimes and institutional choices route value, then automate behaviors that keep you invested through noise. Pair boring personal rules with a realistic macro lens so both your household and your polity build assets that throw off income over time.

Quick Links: [Raw Excerpts](#raw-excerpts) · [Categorized Excerpts](#categorized-excerpts) · [Granular Subtopics](#granular)

## Recent Updates (Aug–Sep 2025)
- Reframes "fuck you money" as the margin that buys security and freedom without subsidising status-seeking obligations.
- Doubles down on the "trading into the sunset" blueprint: single-universe architecture, 2 bps execution target, and crypto ledgers as micro-to-macro data exhaust.
- Captures the visceral love–hate cycle of quant work—gut-punch drawdowns offset by rare, compounding wins when conviction and luck align.

## Key Quotes
- "The biggest financial mistake I've ever made is not starting to invest earlier. The second biggest was selling my Apple stock in 2010." — see [Portfolio Rules & Behavior](#portfolio-behavior)
- "Make enough money that you meet your needs for security, but not so much you use it to meet your needs for love, belonging and status." — see [Autonomy & Freedom](#autonomy)

## Representative Points
- Interest-rate regime shifts transfer value; banks profit from higher rates.
- Wealth holders benefit from rolling over government debt at higher yields.
- Bank of England’s policy choices shape distribution and incentives.
- The state should build assets for passive income, not lean only on income tax.
- Start investing early; avoid reactive, short-term trades you’ll regret.
- Treat price as a freedom signal: independence comes from covering necessities so you can refuse misaligned demands and still sleep at night.

## Why It Matters
- Financial literacy and asset-building choices drive compounding at the personal level and shape distribution at the societal level; aligning policy and behavior compounds stability and freedom.

## Traceability
- Top-level: initial 20-theme list in `logBook-history-summary-20.md`.
- Chunks: 50001–55000 (interest rates, bonds, BoE, state assets).
- Additions: `logBook` ≈69500–70350 (Aug–Sep 2025 entries on financial autonomy, trading cadence, crypto data exhaust).

- Start early; automate; avoid impulsive selling — see Categorized Excerpts (§ below).
- Build low-cost execution (≈2 bps), use AI agents, and iterate — see Granular Subtopics (§ below).
- Policy shapes returns: deficits, bonds/reserves, and IR=0 debate — see Categorized Excerpts (§ below).
- Open ledgers enable micro→macro accountability — see Raw Excerpts (§ below).

## Representative Examples
Building a personal portfolio is inseparable from understanding the interest-rate regime you live in. When rates rise, commercial banks tend to widen net interest margins while savers with meaningful assets benefit from higher coupons on rolled-over government paper. Households with floating-rate debt feel the other side of the equation. LJ’s point is that these flows aren’t “just markets”; they’re policy-shaped—and the state itself can (and should) hold productive assets to create passive income, reducing the temptation to solve everything through higher taxes.

The micro-level lesson rhymes with the macro: compounding shows up only if you give it time. Selling a winner too early (e.g., exiting a strong company out of short-term fear) can erase years of future compounding. The antidote is a simple, boring practice—start early, automate contributions, and avoid decisions driven by anxiety or headlines. Portfolio rules that prevent impulsive selling are, in practice, guards against your future regret.

### Personal Finance
- Goal: accumulate $10M disposable assets by 2035; prefer asset-building and scalable income over solo consulting labor.
- Career–finance trade-off: quant = money but boring; ML = interesting but poorer initially; optimize for long-term compounding of skills and assets.
- Philosophy: FINE not FIRE — Financial Independence, Next Endeavour (not “retire early”).
- Autonomy: "fuck you money" covers necessities so you can reject misaligned expectations; price paid is the freedom to walk.
> FINE not FIRE: FINE - Financial Independence Next Endevour (not FIRE - Financial Independence Retire Early; booring)

### Quant Trading
- Pivot back to quant with AI agents; replatform from legacy `itrade` to `pytrade` covering analytics, modeling, optimization, simulation, and reporting.
- Execution focus: build trading engine to reduce costs to ~2 bps; signals secondary until execution is efficient.
- Love–hate with markets: emotional cost of drawdowns vs conviction and asymmetric upside when right; luck acknowledged as material.
- R&D cadence: profit center dynamics, frequent deployments; downsides include shift work, low SNR, and ambiguity in performance attribution.
- GEPA stock-picking: iterative prompt evolution with real-money feedback; unify technical (data-driven) and fundamental (accounting-driven) signals over time.
- Universe & instruments: single “World” universe spanning equities, futures, ETFs, options, etc.
> A single World universe, members of the universe are all securities types: equities, futures, etfs, options, etc.

### Macro & Policy
- MMT framing: government deficit equals private-sector surplus; bonds as interest-bearing savings instruments rather than necessary funding.
- BoE reserves/bonds mechanics: level-1 reserves vs level-2 bank money; bonds as savings accounts on the central bank’s ledger; interest credited as reserve increments.
- Sequence: spending recorded first; bond sales follow to manage balances; deficit spend not contingent on prior borrowing.
- Interest-rate policy: arguments for IR=0 default (reduce business costs and inflation pass-through) vs paying savers for delayed consumption and inflation risk.
- US sovereign capacity: issuer of currency can settle bonds at maturity via reserve creation absent a chosen default.
- Gilts as “make whole” for dilution: deficits dilute £ holders; gilts pay interest to compensate.
> Issuing extra £££ via deficit dilutes the existing £££ holders… an obligation for UK.Gov to buy UK bonds is created so the diluted £££ holders can exchange for gilts, get interest back, and are “made whole”.
- Taxes & transparency: public access and burden debates; arguments for reducing taxes to boost consumption.
> Nordic countries tax returns are public; Italy made tax returns public (briefly) — hugely popular.
> "Taxes are at ATH already. The state should do less..."
> "To increase consumption, they need to leave more money in the pockets of consumers... reduce taxes a bit."

### Crypto & Open Ledger
- Macro vision: open ledgers enable micro-to-macro visibility; “Google of the economy” by aggregating all transactions to ground macro in micro foundations.
- Strategy: mid-term quant that unifies technical trading and fundamental accounting with double-entry consistency at the top.

## Granular Subtopics
<a id="granular"></a>

<a id="execution-costs"></a>
### Execution & Costs
- Target execution cost near ~2 bps by prioritizing engine quality over signal expansion.
> Keep to the "trading into the sunset" plan. Need a trading engine to get to 2bps trading costs. Signals are less important for time being. Engine in C++ is most important atm.

<a id="portfolio-behavior"></a>
### Portfolio Rules & Behavior
- Automate contributions; add safeguards against regret-driven selling; focus on scalable asset-building over solo labor.
> "The biggest financial mistake I've ever made is not starting to invest earlier. The second biggest was selling my Apple stock in 2010."

<a id="risk-leverage"></a>
### Risk & Leverage
- Favor conservative position sizing; consider half-Kelly when estimates are noisy; understand gross vs net exposures.
> Kelly criterion leverage f = μ/σ²; deploy half‑Kelly. Example: with μ=2% and σ=4% (p.a.), half‑Kelly ≈ 6.25× gross, e.g., Long=3, Short=−3 (Gross=6, Net=0).

<a id="housing-isas"></a>
### Housing & ISAs
- Practical personal finance: mortgages, shared household budgeting, and tax-advantaged accounts (LISA/ISA) for property.
> "A mortgage of £120K monthly rate was < £800 per month..."
> "When thinking about house mortgage settling down—you only need to think about 1/2 of the cost..."
> "Join LISA ISA-s to buy a single property so to make use of the L/ISA-s."

<a id="markets-feedback"></a>
### Markets & Feedback Loops
- Markets self-correct via negative feedback (price→supply/demand), but momentum/oligopoly dynamics can create positive feedback and instability.
> "Negative feedback loops in... markets (reversion)... Positive feedback... markets (momentum)..."
> "Where negative feedback... is missing, creating a market fails."

<a id="inflation-policy"></a>
### Inflation & Policy
- Nuanced inflation takes: need automatic stabilizers; trade-offs between unemployment and inflation risks.
> "MMT's notions of inflation..."; "Choice between option#1: inflation 100% losing 10% wealth; or option#2: unemployment 10% losing 100% wealth."

<a id="portfolio-construction"></a>
### Portfolio Construction
- Practice: multiperiod quadratic optimization (e.g., MOSEK) with constraints; market-neutral posture common (Net≈0, Gross≈2) with group/risk constraints.
> “Portfolio construction” is setting up a quadratic optimization problem… Market neutral: portfolio sums to +1 long, −1 short (Net 0, Gross 2). Group (sector) and risk constraints added; repeated across horizons.

<a id="taxes-accounts"></a>
### Taxes & Accounts
- Use tax-advantaged accounts for goals (e.g., LISA/ISA for property) and budget recurring taxes realistically.
> "KJ + VJ idea: join LISA ISA-s to buy a single property so to make use of the L/ISA-s."
> "You will just pay the monthly bills (gas, electricity, Internet, Council tax)…"
- Policy context (not advice): transparency and burden debates intersect with personal finance choices.
> Nordic countries tax returns are public; Italy made tax returns public (briefly) — hugely popular.
> "Taxes are at ATH already. The state should do less..."

<a id="autonomy"></a>
### Autonomy & Freedom
- Treat "fuck you money" as the cushion that covers shelter, food, and bandwidth so you can refuse misaligned work or social scripts without courting ruin.
> Make enough money that you meet your needs for security, but not so much you use it to meet your needs for love, belonging and status. (@VividVoid_)
- Sees price as an agency signal: paying lets you buy the right to walk away.
> "Does it mean the price people pay is their freedom? The freedom to do as they like and please?"

<!-- AUTO_SUMMARY_END -->

- Solve a problem you have; founder–problem fit wins.
- Keep feedback loops tight; ship, learn, iterate.
- Validate with real workflows; avoid idea theater.
- Expand to adjacent users only after nailing your own use case.
- Treat open-source AI infrastructure and remote-first teaming as experiments; expect power-law results and plan for long odds.

## Representative Examples
Founder–problem fit starts with irritation you can describe in painful detail. You automate a daily workflow for yourself—say, reconciling data across tools—then you notice colleagues asking for your script. The product is born from reducing your own friction. Early users look like you, which shortens the feedback loop: each iteration removes a concrete annoyance rather than chasing a speculative persona.

Contrast that with brainstorming in a vacuum. Features drift toward what “sounds good,” demos impress, but usage is shallow. LJ’s stance is to keep the loop tight: build for yourself, then for a circle of people like you, then for adjacent circles. Each expansion earns the right to exist by removing real, felt pain.

## Raw Excerpts (Entrepreneurship)
> - Build an open source open weights model and accompanying software. Build OpenAIlabUK.
>   Alternate path: seek funding with London hedge funds like DPFM, Quadrature, Marshall Wace, GSA—the equivalents to DeepSeek.

> - LJ job – startup.
>   + https://www.workatastartup.com/ (remote filters, equity-first bets).
>   + High risk, full time, max equity—maybe not ideal but viable when lacking a pre-assembled team.
>   + Startup ideas explorer: https://www.ideabrowser.com/next-idea.

> - Any creative field has ruthless Pareto distribution. Simplifying it as 20/80 hides the reality: with N works, roughly √N capture most of the upside. Out of 1,000 books, ~30 succeed while 970 fail.

> - "We do these things not because they are easy, but because we thought they were going to be easy." Overconfidence is necessary—only slightly irrational optimists start ventures that rational analysis would deem too risky.

<!-- AUTO_SUMMARY_END -->

- AI augments people; tool + human beats human alone.
- Verify real humans online to raise signal, reduce bots.
- GPUs + clear feedback loops drove breakthroughs (AlphaZero, FunSearch).
- Favor open-source and good governance to avoid centralization risks.
- Champion open compute and multi-platform distribution; push back on doom narratives with evidence and liberal guardrails.

## Representative Examples
Verification of real humans online is a practical, near-term way to raise the signal-to-noise ratio. Bots and coordinated inauthentic behavior erode discourse; proof-of-person systems (with privacy-preserving designs) can make networks more trustworthy without turning them into closed clubs.

Language reach matters in lived experience. Seeing an assistant correctly recognize and respond in Macedonian is more than a party trick; it’s a hint that capability is broadening access. That makes AI less of a “lab novelty” and more of an everyday amplifier for communities that are often underserved by technology defaults.

Where feedback loops are crisp—like Go and Chess—systems such as AlphaZero and FunSearch generated novel strategies and knowledge. The pathway wasn’t magic: gaming GPUs scaled the underlying compute, enabling the current wave. LJ’s framing keeps the center of gravity on “AI as augmentation”: a tool that multiplies human ability when it’s open enough to be scrutinized and steered, yet governed enough to mitigate concentrated power and misuse.

## Raw Excerpts (Technology & AI)
> - Stallman not Marx should have been the interest of choice if humanities people had any sense, or even taste. RMS turned idealism into tangible systems—TCP/IP, GNU/Linux, open stacks—that quietly changed the world while the “chattering classes” produced hot air.

> - Bsky is closest to Twitter: text read/write, posts as quanta of ideas. Feeds feature is excellent—I have 50 pinned vs X’s crappy 2. Starter packs help immensely; new users on X start from zero follows and zero followers. Can you imagine a worse onboarding experience?

> - Can we have Codex use GPT-OSS models served via `llama.cpp` please? (Atm only works via Ollama afaics.)

> - I disagree that AI is that big a threat to humanity. Our existential risks are 1) thermo-nuclear war, 2) meteorite impact, 3) civilisation-ending virus, 4) volcanic winter. AI should help decrease 1–4, even if it slightly increases civilisational strain via faster change.

> - Doomers cult that has developed is a danger. Proposals like “bomb the data centres” or “detain AI scientists” are authoritarian. Societies that freeze change eventually shatter when the dam breaks. Boosters must fight uphill against default human fear of the new.

> - I think of context as RAM. With 2M tokens we’re talking about ~2 MB of RAM—not that much. Compute-next means socratic Chat-as-programming, dialogue-as-code, LLM-as-CPU, Context-as-RAM.

## Granular Subtopics

<a id="open-builders"></a>
### Open Builders
- Elevates free software heritage—Stallman’s idealism made concrete through decades of interoperable stacks.
> "If academics in the humanities had any sense… they would look not to Marx but to Stallman, who turned idealism into tangible, actionable systems for human betterment."

<a id="network-presence"></a>
### Network Presence
- Treat distribution as part of the stack: join every network, master onboarding, and use feed tooling (e.g., Bluesky’s pins) to raise signal.
> "Bsky Feeds feature is excellent… Starter packs help immensely when you are new. New users on X start from 0 follows, 0 followers. Can you imagine a worse new user experience?"

<a id="ai-risk"></a>
### AI Risk Framing
- Lists real extinction risks (nukes, asteroids, pandemics, volcanoes) and argues AI reduces them if kept within liberal, adaptive institutions.
> "AI should help decrease risks 1–4… Doom ‘solutions’ like bombing data centres would break society faster than models ever could."

- Lead with usefulness; let value do the selling.
- Authenticity beats hype over the long run.
- Be consistent; align promises with outcomes.
- Make marketing indistinguishable from helpful documentation.
- Treat onboarding and distribution as marketing moments—reduce friction and let earnest enthusiasm show.

## Representative Examples
"The best marketing doesn’t feel like marketing" plays out when the product and its explanation do the selling. Public docs that teach, transparent roadmaps, and interactive demos that solve a tiny but real problem are marketing because they are genuinely useful. People share them not out of evangelism, but because they help.

The opposite is the brand that talks louder as it drifts further from the job to be done. LJ’s bias is to make the useful thing, then describe it clearly. Trust accrues when the promises in the copy match the outcomes in the hands.

## Raw Excerpts (Marketing & Branding)
> - Bsky Feeds feature is excellent—I have 50 pinned. X is like “it’s 1980, 2 should be enough for everyone.” Starter packs help immensely when you are new; new users on X start from 0 follows, 0 followers—can you imagine a worse onboarding?

> - I am a fan—more power to them, long may it continue. I don’t mind the innuendo, the marketing… to be cringe is to be human!

# Theme 8: Philosophy & Life Lessons
<a id="theme-8"></a>

Accepts uncertainty: the future is unknowable and it’s wiser to resist seductive trends than cling to false certainty. On truth, stresses how hard it is to discern in a noisy, propagandized world; echoes that “science advances funeral by funeral,” urging intellectual humility. Offers “love is the third way” as a practical moral compass.

## Executive Intro
Plan with humility and act with compassion. When outcomes are uncertain, trade brittle certainty for adaptable principles; when tribes demand allegiance, pick the third way that heals rather than scores points.

## Recent Updates (Aug–Sep 2025)
- Grounds identity in memory and prediction: the "I" is the organizing principle that persists across time.
- Distinguishes groups from teams, highlights how stories and incentives crystallize cooperation—and how stupid stories break societies.
- Revisits Cipolla’s taxonomy of human stupidity to stay humble about motivations (intelligent, helpless, bandit, stupid quadrants).

## Key Quotes
- "The only thing that is constant is change."
- "Love is the third way."
- "Science advances funeral by funeral."
- "Without memory we would be functional programs… the 'I' is the organizing principle, the thing that survives." — see [Memory & Identity](#memory-identity)

## Representative Points
- Embrace uncertainty; avoid false certainty and trendy dogmas.
- Intellectual humility: continually update beliefs with evidence.
- Recognize that propaganda and incentives warp perceived truth.
- Prefer durable principles (e.g., love/compassion) over factionalism.
- Understand cooperation dynamics: groups form around stories, incentives, and gradients; stupidity laws remind us how easily we hurt ourselves.

## Why It Matters
- Humility about uncertainty and attention to incentives reduce dogmatism and improve decision quality under ambiguity.

## Traceability
- Top-level: initial 20-theme list in `logBook-history-summary-20.md`.
- Chunks: 50001–55000 (inevitability of change; “third way”); 55001–60000 (truth, humility); 60001–65000 (truth, “funeral by funeral”); 65001–66989 (truth and humility reiterated).

<!-- AUTO_SUMMARY_END -->

- Embrace uncertainty; resist false certainty and trends.
- Practice intellectual humility; update beliefs with evidence.
- “Love is the third way” over zero-sum tribalism.
- Incentives and propaganda distort perceived truth.
- Memory grounds identity; stories can heal or doom groups—choose wisely.

## Representative Examples
Uncertainty is not a bug to be eradicated but a condition to be respected. Plans that pretend to know the future are brittle; principles that accept volatility are robust. LJ’s “love is the third way” reframes zero-sum tribal choices: when both sides are optimizing for victory, opt out and optimize for compassion and repair.

Truth-seeking is slow because incentives push in the opposite direction. Propaganda rewards speed and confidence; humility rewards accuracy and learning. Holding beliefs lightly, updating in public, and naming your incentives are small acts that resist the undertow.

## Raw Excerpts (Philosophy & Life)
> - Without memory we would be functional programs—stateless Gödel undecidable entities. The “I” is the organizing principle that survives across time (for a limited time only).

> - Difference between a group and a team: a team is chosen (and can be changed); a group is assigned (and cannot be changed). Groups form when enough individuals coalesce around a divider issue, creating a gradient of in-group benefit versus out-group cost.

> - Humans coordinate via stories: we invent fictions, believe them, act on them. When the stories change, cooperation changes; stupid stories make us collectively stupid.

> - Love is the residual unexplained part after rationality—like information is the residual of randomness after the forecast is subtracted from the response.

> - Cipolla’s taxonomy: intelligent (+,+), helpless (−,+), stupid (−,−), bandit (+,−). Stupid people cause losses for themselves and others with no gain.

## Granular Subtopics

<a id="memory-identity"></a>
### Memory & Identity
- Memory stitches continuity; without it the “I” evaporates into stateless computation.
> "The 'I' is the organizing principle, the thing that does not change with time but survives (for a limited time only)."

<a id="group-dynamics"></a>
### Group Dynamics
- Teams are elective and fluid; groups are inherited. Stories and incentives create gradients that define in/out boundaries.
> "A group/team is formed by sufficient number of individuals coalescing around a random thing… in-group better off, out-group worse off."

<a id="stupidity-laws"></a>
### Laws of Stupidity
- Cipolla’s quadrants remind us that harm often comes from people who lose while making others lose; stay humble about motives.
> "Tom loss and Dick loss ⇒ Tom was stupid (S)."

# Theme 9: Social Commentary & Current Events
<a id="theme-9"></a>

Critiques tribalism and the decline of reasoned discourse, warning against the temptation to game electoral systems. On Russia–Ukraine, argues that weakness provokes aggression, rejects appeasement by analogy to the pre–WWII era, and contends that Central and Eastern European states need their own nuclear deterrent. Reflects on the pervasiveness of propaganda and the practical difficulty of finding truth.

## Executive Intro
Strong institutions and sober deterrence lower the odds of catastrophic error. Resist gaming the rules for short-term gains; insist on media literacy and fair play even when it costs your side.

## Recent Updates (Aug–Sep 2025)
- Notes that Northern Europe has AD (assured destruction) against Russia but not MAD—unity and independent deterrence remain urgent.
- Calls out moral-panic “doomers”: warns that authoritarian fixes (bomb data centres, jail scientists) would collapse free societies faster than AI.
- Laments fair-weather liberalism: Ukrainians carry “give me freedom or give me death” while Western comfort incentives drift toward appeasement.

## Key Quotes
- "We are more divided than ever. We need to find a way to come together."
- "Atm Northern Europe have AD vs Russia, but not MAD: Russia can destroy them, but not vice versa. Only a direct threat may keep fractious siblings united." — see [Deterrence Stakes](#deterrence-stakes)

## Representative Points
- Tribal incentives displace reasoned debate; institutions can be gamed.
- Deterrence matters: perceived weakness invites aggression.
- Anti-appeasement stance draws historical parallels to pre–WWII Europe.
- Suggests CEE countries need independent nuclear deterrence.
- Navigating propaganda requires skepticism and source triangulation.
- Warns that authoritarian “solutions” to tech fears (bomb data centres, detain scientists) would doom liberal societies faster than the risks they decry.

## Why It Matters
- Clear-eyed deterrence and media literacy reduce the risks of conflict, manipulation, and institutional drift.

## Traceability

<!-- AUTO_SUMMARY_END -->

- Tribalism erodes discourse; prioritize fair play over hacks.
- Credible deterrence discourages aggression; appeasement invites it.
- Media literacy is a practical defense against propaganda.
- Guard institutions even when it hurts “your side.”
- Independent deterrence and liberal stamina matter more than panic-driven authoritarian fixes.

## Representative Examples
In security, perceived weakness invites tests. LJ applies this logic to Russia–Ukraine: appeasement signals room to push, while credible deterrence raises the cost of aggression. For small states, he argues, relying entirely on distant guarantors is risky; a homegrown deterrent, however controversial, changes the calculus of would‑be aggressors.

At home, political discourse often drifts into team sport. When the game becomes “beat the system,” it is tempting to hack district maps, voting rules, or media ecosystems for advantage. The short-run wins come at the expense of legitimacy. Re-centering on fair play—even when it hurts your side—is the long-game bet that institutions will be there when you need them most.

## Raw Excerpts (Social Commentary)
> - Atm Northern Europe have AD vs Russia, but not MAD: Russia can destroy them, but not vice versa. Only a direct war threat may keep fractious siblings united long enough.

> - I think only an independent nuclear deterrent by Poland, the Nordics, Ukraine, and the Baltics can stop this war and those incoming from Russia. Trading one big risk for many smaller ones, but there’s nothing else.

> - Doomers cult is a grave danger: proposals like “bomb the data centres” or “detain AI scientists” are authoritarian. Societies that freeze change end up breaking catastrophically once the dam bursts.

> - Ukrainians are about the only liberals left with a fire in their bellies of the “give me freedom or give me death” persuasion. Most of the rest are fair-weather travellers clutching pearls for comfort.

## Granular Subtopics

- Clarity beats cleverness in code and prose.
- Write for the next maintainer; reduce ambiguity.
- Raise abstraction to defuse personal conflict in discussion.
- Keep focus on ideas and tradeoffs.
- Iterate drafts with feedback (human or AI) to blend empathy and structure.

## Representative Examples
“Boring code” is code you can read six months later without a tour guide. Explicit names beat clever one-liners; straightforward control flow beats magic. The test of clarity is whether a teammate with no context can make a safe change after a short read.

In discussion, moving up an abstraction level turns “you’re wrong” into “what objective are we optimizing for?” Person-level conflict tends to shrink the problem to egos; idea-level framing opens it back up to tradeoffs and criteria.

## Raw Excerpts (Writing & Communication)
> - Dear Rory Stewart—congratulations on the excellent interview. Unlike most critics, you proposed five solutions to five problems. Reframe the UK’s information overload by distributing decision rights and embracing radical transparency so complexity can be handled locally.

- Explores intuition (type-1) vs logical teardown (type-2) loops for innovation cadence.
- Notes how compression and Kolmogorov complexity tie learning to discovering the simplest programs.

## Key Quotes
- "Creativity is just connecting things."
- "Research—'re-search'—feels speculative; a stellar solution is like a miracle, some trick that works against expectations." — see [Research Cadence](#research-cadence)

## Representative Points
- Knowledge is collective: nodes and connections matter.
- Smaller, fragmented groups risk knowledge regression.
- Innovation compounds when ideas recombine across domains.
- Build and tend networks that enable serendipitous connection.
- Alternate divergent intuition with convergent critique—type-1 guess, type-2 teardown—to keep the creative flywheel spinning.

## Why It Matters
- Innovation thrives in dense, connected knowledge networks that recombine ideas.

## Traceability
- Top-level: initial 20-theme list in `logBook-history-summary-20.md`.
- Chunks: 50001–55000 (collective knowledge; nodes and connections).

- Creativity is connecting nodes in a knowledge network.
- Dense, diverse networks produce more recombinations.
- Shrinking groups risk knowledge regression.
- Design spaces where serendipity happens on purpose.
- Treat creativity as iterative search: guess wildly, test brutally, compress insights into reusable programs.

## Representative Examples
Knowledge is a network property. When groups shrink, they lose nodes and edges; tacit knowledge evaporates as specialists disperse. The result can be a real regression—fewer recombinations, fewer sparks.

Creativity, then, is less about lone genius and more about connecting islands of expertise. You create spaces (physical or digital) where weird overlaps happen on purpose. Over time, the network does what individuals can’t: it remembers, recombines, and surprises.

## Raw Excerpts (Creativity & Innovation)
> - Research—“re-search,” repeated search for something that works—feels speculative. A good solution is like magic; a stellar solution is like a miracle.

> - Scaling up R&D discovery with ML-AI tik-tok cadence: type 1 pattern recognition to guess; type 2 chain-of-thought logic to test and tear down.

> - An image is worth 16×16 words, but a program is worth 2⁴ images. Compression is learning; forecasting error >0 reveals an extra dimension.

## Granular Subtopics

- Prefer workable "least-bad" systems over utopias.
- Judge policies against realistic alternatives, not perfection.
- Incentives-aware realism beats wishful thinking.
- Use history as a pattern library for the present.
- Expect cycles—monarchies, oligarchies, democracies decay in turn; design for the next swing.

## Representative Examples
Having lived through failed socialist reforms and civil conflict, LJ’s priors are skeptical of utopias. Systems are judged against workable alternatives, not against perfection. The “least bad” frame is not cynicism; it’s a bias toward arrangements that survive contact with human incentives.

History is a pattern library for the present. You notice when old motifs reappear with new names and can ask better questions: What happened last time? What changed? What would have needed to be different to get a different outcome?

## Raw Excerpts (History & Biography)
> - Three types of political power (rule of one, few, many) each have good/bad modes: monarchy → tyrant; aristocracy → oligarchy; democracy → anarchy; then a king-saviour resets the cycle (James Burnham).

> - "Freedom or death" isn’t abstract. Our national anthem repeats “Freedom” thrice; liberation slogans still echo from late-20th-century struggles.

> - Moral panics repeat: TV, VHS, early computers, consoles, internet, now AI friends—same script, new target.

## Granular Subtopics

<a id="burnham-cycle"></a>
### Burnham Cycle
- Political regimes rotate through rule of one/few/many; design institutions that survive the turn.
> "Start with monarchy → tyrant → aristocracy → oligarchy → democracy → anarchy → a king-saviour."

<a id="freedom-creed"></a>
### Freedom Creed
- Lived slogans (“Freedom or death”) anchor liberal instincts; history reminds comfort can dull resolve.
> "Our anthem exclaims Freedom three times…"

# Theme 15: Science & Nature
<a id="theme-15"></a>

Expresses awe at the universe through science, while acknowledging the social dynamics of scientific change—“science advances funeral by funeral”—and how hard it is for people to change their minds.

## Executive Intro
Pair curiosity with humility. Build and refine models that explain more over time, while remembering that social realities slow paradigm shifts even when evidence is strong.

## Recent Updates (Aug–Sep 2025)
- Notes Penrose’s mass–frequency equivalence: E = mc² = hf ⇒ mass/time linked via m·T ≈ 7.3×10⁻⁵¹.
- Frames knowledge transfer as movement against entropy: information copies rather than moves, yet recording it still increases local disorder.
- Highlights sensor evolution—humans lack internal sensors because evolution couldn’t actuate fixes; tech must fill the gap.

## Key Quotes
- "The more I learn about science, the more I am in awe of the universe."
- "Science advances funeral by funeral."
- "Information and knowledge spreads from A to B—it copies rather than moves. Yet encoding it raises entropy where it lands." — see [Information Flow](#information-flow)

## Representative Points
- Scientific progress is wondrous yet socially constrained.
- Paradigm shifts are hard because people resist changing beliefs.
- Humility is essential: our models are provisional and improving.
- Physics still surprises: mass, frequency, and time intertwine; information flow fights entropy at a cost.

## Why It Matters
- Scientific awe fuels curiosity; recognizing social inertia tempers overconfidence in current models.

## Traceability
- Top-level: initial 20-theme list in `logBook-history-summary-20.md`.
- Chunks: no explicit per-chunk entries in provided segments.

- Prefer Bayesian updates over belief whiplash.
- Remember the physics: energy, mass, and time intertwine; copying knowledge still obeys thermodynamics.

## Representative Examples
Scientific awe and scientific humility go together. The more the universe yields to measurement, the more we see how provisional our models are. “Funeral by funeral” is a reminder that even brilliant people have incentives and identities tied up in the status quo.

Practically, that counsels for Bayesian updates rather than revolutions in belief: weight new evidence, adjust credences, and keep exploring. Curiosity is the engine; humility keeps you from driving it off a cliff of overconfidence.

## Raw Excerpts (Science & Nature)
> - (Penrose) Energy is E = mc² = hf. With f = 1/T, we get m·T = h/c² ≈ 7.3×10⁻⁵¹. Having mass means having time; zero mass implies infinite time.

> - Information and knowledge move against entropy via copying: B gains information without A losing it, yet the entropy in B increases more than the decrease in disorder from the transfer.

> - Human sensors are mostly skin-level; evolution didn’t give us rich internal monitors because detection without intervention was useless. Augmentation will come via ever better personal sensors.

## Granular Subtopics

<a id="information-flow"></a>
### Information Flow
- Copying knowledge multiplies insight but still obeys thermodynamics; encoding costs energy and raises local entropy.
> "Information and knowledge spreads from A to B… In the process B copying, entropy in B increases."

<a id="mass-time"></a>
### Mass & Time
- Mass and time intertwine via Planck constant; physics links our existence to temporal budgets.
> "m·T = h/c² ≈ 7.3×10⁻⁵¹. Having mass means having time."

# Theme 16: Food & Cooking
<a id="theme-16"></a>

Cooking as therapy: appreciates the hands-on craft and calm it brings.

## Executive Intro
Step away from screens into a sensory craft. Simple, repeatable cooking rituals create presence and connection—small anchors that make days feel whole.

## Recent Updates (Aug–Sep 2025)
- Eyes future sensors that track calories and blood chemistry continuously—closing the loop between diet and wellbeing.
- Notes foodbanks signal abundance plus generosity: food exists, but distribution relies on people gifting it forward.
- Links obesity to metabolic signaling rather than morality; some bodies hoard energy despite effort.

## Key Quotes
- "I love to cook. It's my therapy."
- "If people are using foodbanks, the food is there—the resource would go unused unless people are charitable enough to gift it." — see [Food Distribution](#food-distribution)

## Representative Points
- Hands-on making provides calm and focus.
- Simple, repeatable rituals beat elaborate, one-off meals.
- Sharing food strengthens relationships and culture.
- Pay attention to inputs: sensors, metabolism, and community safety nets all shape how food nourishes.

## Why It Matters
- Shared craft and meals improve well-being and strengthen social bonds.

## Traceability
- Top-level: initial 20-theme list in `logBook-history-summary-20.md`.
- Chunks: no explicit per-chunk entries in provided segments.
- Additions: `logBook` ≈260–290 (sensors, travel/food) & 1540–1610 (foodbanks, obesity signaling).

## TL;DR

<!-- AUTO_SUMMARY_START -->
### Auto Highlights
- The entry explores the cumulative impact of minor daily caloric imbalances on weight gain, highlighting how a small excess (1 apple/day) leads to significant long-term weight increase. It connects to health science through the lens of energy balance and metabolism (Category 6), touches on thermodynamic principles in biological systems (Category 15), and addresses dietary patterns as a key factor in nutrition science (Category 16).
- The entry discusses considering home ventilation improvements as a DIY project, reflecting on practical aspects of living environment and personal health.

Compares costs to existing drugs like Wegovy/Mounjaro (£300/month in UK). Connects to health innovation (Category 6), the science of metabolism and information theory (Category 15), and food/nutrition as a health intervention (Category 16).
<!-- AUTO_SUMMARY_END -->

- Cooking is craft-based therapy and presence.
- Favor repeatable kitchen rhythms over one-off performances.
- Shared meals strengthen bonds and culture.
- Simple staples make the habit stick.
- Pair kitchen craft with better feedback loops—sensors, community, and metabolic awareness.

## Representative Examples
Cooking moves attention from screens to senses. Chopping, stirring, tasting—these are anchors that pull you into the present. The outcome is tangible: a meal shared, a small ritual that marks the day as more than a sprint from task to task.

The best kitchen is repeatable. A handful of staples, a few techniques, and a rhythm that lowers friction make it more likely you’ll actually cook—and therefore more likely you’ll get the therapy you’re after.

## Raw Excerpts (Food & Cooking)
> - Sensors and continuous monitoring of molecules in the body—including food/diet calorie tracking—will make intervention easier and gains compounding.

> - If people are using foodbanks, the food is there. The resource would go unused unless people are charitable enough to gift it to those in need.

> - Obesity may be a consequence of the body underpowered for years; fat cells behave like a separate organ that refuses to shrink, asking the body to eat more.

## Granular Subtopics

<a id="food-distribution"></a>
### Food Distribution
- Community generosity routes surplus to need; cooking sits inside broader social safety nets.
> "If people are using foodbanks, the food is there… people are charitable enough to gift it."

- Family is a core value and cooperative unit.
- Household sharing shapes early political intuitions.
- Humor smooths everyday domestic frictions.
- Quiet systems and norms enable harmony.
- Keep ambitions simple: examined life, shared love, comfortable family-scale socialism.

## Representative Examples
Families often run on the principle “from each according to ability, to each according to need.” It’s intuitive when you’ve grown up in a household where resources are pooled and redistributed with love. LJ notes that this experience helps explain why collectivist ideals feel attractive to the young—it’s how their best cooperative unit already works.

Domestic life is also funny. The recurring scene: someone asking where an item is, and the reply, “If I knew where it was, it would be in its place.” It’s a joke and a nudge toward the quiet systems that make shared spaces work.

## Raw Excerpts (Relationships & Family)
> - Living the examined life: loving and being loved by family and friends; ambition is typing away into a solarpunk garden office, maybe seeing kids have kids.

> - With my family I am a socialist; with close friends a socialist; at the state level a democrat; at the federal level a libertarian—the larger the group, the more trust must be engineered (Taleb/Naval).
