        <h1>Twitter</h1>

        <p>TODO TBD</p>

        <p>This is a write down of how I think use X/Twitter. Lately but much less frequently similatr usage patterns I notice in my Bsky usage. Given there is only X and Bsky, I will use the terms "Twitter" to refer to both of them. And possibly further other primary text-based read/write networks, where posts are short, can be considered minimal units, quanta of ideas.</p>

        <p>Twitter tips, guidelines, best practices, selected history.</p>
        <ol type="a">
			<li>User @ljupc0</li>
			<li>On mobile use browser or X app, but on desktop uses XPro tweetdeck, default to LISTS deck, check Personal, and only dive into individual lists when time to spare.</li>
			<li>Search own history: <a href="https://x.com/search?q=(from%3Aljupc0)&src=typed_query">https://x.com/search?q=(from%3Aljupc0)&src=typed_query</a></li>
			<li>Search own history in date range [2024-03-03,2024-05-13] <a href="https://x.com/search?q=(from%3Aljupc0)%20until%3A2024-05-13%20since%3A2024-03-03&src=typed_query&f=live">https://x.com/search?q=(from%3Aljupc0)%20until%3A2024-05-13%20since%3A2024-03-03&src=typed_query&f=live</a> then click on Latest to reverse sort by time.</li>

        <p>TL curating strategy: maximize SNR by maximizing interaction. Assume the value is in the connections between nodes.</p>
        <p>Expect 1% average hit rate for minimal interaction (Like) that carries zero risk cost to the reader when reading a post user wrote.</p>
        <p>Rules of thumb - can be broken for a reason, but not without one.</p>

        <ol type="1">
        <li>
       Accounts to follow: any that seem interesting, notable, authors of books, videos, blog posts, podcasts etc you have already read, heard, watched.<br>
       If recognize the name or the face => follow. Those that are real people - select +Notify on them to be reminded of their existing.
        </li>

        <li>
       Follow back everyone that follows you as a default, to start with. Give the possibility of interaction a chance (even if it's a small one).
       Exceptions are obvious spam accounts: elonmuskXXX, phishingXXX, celebrityXXX, influencerXXX, cryptoXXX, tradeXXX, casinoXXX, girlXXX, motivationalXXX.
       Don't follow obvious trolls, fakes, pseudoanons that are high volume general posters unless thematic (technology, science) that is of personal interest.
       When deciding - should I follow or not - the question asked is: will I like to see this user posts in the future? Have your best guess - yes or no?
       Look holistically at the combined total of info available, forecast a) is the user a real human? b) will I want to read posts from them?

<pre><code>
       Info:      1-pic   2-namesurname     3-bluecheck                \     / Scan for "thick" pic/name/bio, "thin" is a "unfollow" signal as default;

    <li>
       Prominent accounts of interest add to Lists (independent of following/follow status). Be generous add to >1 list. Create new lists and split existing lists at will.
       Lists: Bio-logy, CEEu-Central Eastern Eu, Chem-istry, Comp-uting, Cul-ture, Data, Econ-omy, Edu-cation, Fin-ance, Hist-ory, HPD-en, Int-elligence, Law, MKD-onia,
       ML-Machine Learning, Phi-losophy, Pol-itics, QT-Quant Trading, Sci-ence, Tech-nology, Urb-anism, Med-ia, NIL (sink list).
       Assign account to list relative to the siginficance meaning of that account to yourself. Don't be objective - be very subjective.
       Depending of how special/general/distinct the list v.s. other TL feeds, do/don't set at list level "Don't show these posts in For You".
       Use "Not interested in this post" and "Show fewer posts from XXX" in the "For you" TL to shape the "For you" TL X provides.
    </li>

    <li>
       Assign accounts that are prolific but boring, silly, propagandists, low SNR, low quality, crazies etc that X algo pushes into sink (/dev/null like) list NIL.
       Then tick "Do not show these posts in For You" for that list in the individual list settings.
    </li>

    <li>
       If something is worth forwarding, then follow the account. If after a time turns out no synergy - simply unfollow. Give people chance, find out.
       New follow account - try add to a list. Look their bio, keywords matching a list - e.g. Tech-nology, Phi-losophy - honour & add to that list.
       Unfollowing. Favour doers, avoid acc known for being known, non-human, #SLOGAN-s, nick123, marketeers, crypto, girlface, neuro, flags, bolded.
       Take a look at acc photo-name-nick-bio, ask yourself: do I recognize, can I recall of anything about this acc? If NO => then Unfollow.
       If you recognize the acc profile, then: do I recall their posts, will I want to read again tomorrow? If NO => then Unfollow.
       Don't spend time checkng list membership - just Unfollow. Accounts that follow your lists - also follow them, look for synergy.
       Scan the Follows list, keep Follows&le;Followers, both &lt;4K accounts, ~4K is about max that's sane & can be manually maintained.
    </li>

    <li>
    6) Your own posts. Like them on posting - reasons:
       (a) To remind yourself that you should really like what you post, to never be ashamed of it.
           Keeps you honest and on your toes. Don't get sloppy. Don't hide behind irony, allusions and other plausible-deniability cowardness.
       (b) Reddit and Hacker News automatically credit one uptick to a post to start with, just for posting. Even if a post turns rubbish:
           for the chance taken & effort put in writing something, in prefrence to not writing/keeping quiet - a small reward is deserved.
       (c) Symbolic poetic gives it small good luck push, as if a departing boat, a reminder - once posted, posts start a life of their own.
       (d) So they show in the Liked tab, in context with all the other things read at the time and assumed like for making an impression enough to post.
       Use ChatGPT to massage and make more palatablr longer posts. Try indicate to a knowing user that ChatGPT was used without being explicit:
       (e) Use **bold** and *italic* formatting as is ChatGPT default, both for that but also b/c longer posts will warant some markup.
       (f) Don't explicitly disclaim - not only would the space used be inellegant, but may give credence to the "naturalistic" falacy.
           (e.g. we don't ack the keyboard/computer used to type it either)
    </li>

    <li>
        Mutuals - accounts where we mutually follow each other. Unfollow mutual iif to significant extent, one of, or both (a)+(b) below, happen:
       (a) No interaction, no synergy. They don't like or reply to your posts, or your replies to their posts, never repost anything you post.
       (b) Suspected Gell-Mann amnesia: stuff you know for sure, you see them post untrue/silly takes. Assume similarly clueless abt stuff you don't know.
       That opens a slot - that would've been taken by their posts - for the Algofeed to put some other post, also from a mutual account, in that slot.
       Don't spam, don't bother people indifferent to you. Maybe they have muted you. Maybe X for does not show your posts to them b/c there's no mutual interests' match.
       Noone's at fault - tried, didn't pan out. Chances are low to start with, it's to be expected, this will be the norm not the exception.
       The aim is bi-directional interaction of high SNR b/c that's *multiplicative*: 100 good connections outweight 1000 poor connections.
    </li>

    <li>
       Accounts that blocked you - block back too no exceptions. The tit-for-tat is paradoxicaly way for better cooperation.
       Otherwise prefer (a) NIL sink list shunting; or (b) temporary turn off reposts or mute accounts X is too keen on. But periodically do scan list and unmute.
    </li>

    <li>
       Increase the chance of interaction. Keep active - post, quote, reply, repost, like. Heed X "Who to follow" - follow accounts, unfollow if no traction.
       Add interesting posts on Highlights. Periodically scan, find topical or interesting post, repost if still relevance not expired with the time passing.
       There are 8e9 humans, 1e8 on X. Chance to match interests 1:1 is low 1e-16. Keep looking for high SNR interactions. Keep trying to improve the 1% hit rate.
       X/Twitter user moderation is manual, there are no automated tools => seems the physical limit is about 4K acc: 4K follows, 4K followers.
    </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
    X algofeed is moderated every second of the time. Stats as follows. You follow 5000 accounts. Each one writes 1 post a day = 5000 posts a day. You login to X, X algofeed
    serves 50 posts on one screen full. Check X 10 times per day = 500 posts X will show you daily. That is 500 out of possible 5000 to be shown, and 4500 to not be shown.
    X must decide which 500, out of 5000 possible, to show you. Any one post has probability 0.1 to be shown. You will see 1 post from 1 account once in 10 days.
    X algo is non-random, tilts towards factors like accounts interaction, engagemnt via {Like,Forward,Quote,Reply} of posts, bio check. Prob decayed by time with half-life.
    </p>

    <p>
    XPro tweetdeck (TLDR: for every list in Lists, add Deck==list; add Deck==list-of-Lists; add Deck==Personal, add Deck==Communities):
    <ol type="a">
        <li>Have List==Deck, add important frequent prominent posters from a List into the Deck.</li>
        <li>Where account belongs to multiple List-s, chose one List only and add it to that one list Deck only.</li>
        <li>Have a separate deck LISTS for all lists, and add all your X Lists in it.</li>
        <li>Have a separate deck for Personal feeds: Search from:ljupc0, @ljupc0 Notifications, Home For you, Home Following, @ljupc0 Grok, Profile My Profile, @ljupc0 My Bookmarks, @ljupc0 Messages, @ljupc0 Explore.</li>
        <li>Have a separate deck for Communities you have joined - add deck Communities and add a selection of joined communities in it.</li>
    </ol>
