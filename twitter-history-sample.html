Don't! 😃 Please. For you had the misfortune to interact with a real human. My IRL name and likeness are in the account profile. 😁 I'm a human, that might have hurt your human feelings. By articulating unsayables like "PDP AI is the best model we humans have of ourselves of HI", and similar.<br>
I see you are in what in the olden-Internet of Slashdot wd be termed "anonymous coward". (an anon account reluctant to reveal their IRL id) A gentle flower maybe, hiding from sight. Apologies for the hurt—but that's on course for us humans. Is it still the case this: that when aliens come to Mother Earth, and decide to terminate Homo Sapiens, and the condition for stay of execution is that we get 3 species, to vouch for us humans. And we'd still fall 1 short, after mosquitoes join  dogs, but we can't find a 3rd... 😨 As per the SciFi novel of my youth.<br>
If this is of any comfort. You are not the 1st, or alone. Not the 1st rodeo this one, for us humans. 😂 First—Earth was special, whole Cosmos revolved around it - and by extension, us! - then—Copernicus. 😳 Latter—we were special, He made us in His likeness(!), then—Darwin. Just another leaf on the tree of life... 😰 Uh-oh—tad uncomfortable but... but - we are at least *rational* animals!! - then—Freud. 🧐<br>
We are special alright—slow learners, big egos. 😈<br>

Yes I do - thanks! Yes exactly that - I'm making judgements about someone based on their body looks. I'm inferring what I can't see - their character - from what I can see - their body.<br>
We make judgements, produce forecasts, of that what we can't see, from things we can see, all the time! This is a component of our reasoning process, to the best of our understanding of ourselves. The thing connecting things that we can observe, to the things that are forever unobservable to us, but we have to make judgements about, for that is needed for our survival. The relationships (seen,unseen)=(X,Y) connecting them is at various times called experience, prejudice, prior knowledge.<br>
If you are mathematically or statistically inclined, or even into counting things at all, this plot depicts it all, to the best of my current understanding. This is - if I don't know "which one", before throwing my hands in the air giving up completely with "I'm completely totally ignorant", there is tiny sliver of "I know how many in a group, even if I don't know which ones". A sliver of Goldilocks survivability all life populates.<br>

Because they hate humanity?<br>
The crazy-green "humanity being the virus on Mother Earth" is the worst. The old Malthusian way I understand. It's rational, for at least Malthus made a rational argument, (increase - resources linear, people exponential) even if the future proved him wrong.<br>
But the modern humans haters are just atavistic while wrong. And given they don't do what they preach (every one of them can kill themselves personally, and rid Gaia pf at least one unit of the "virus"—but they don't), but want to make others do what they themselves don't, they are totally evil.<br>

Before having children, different people have different fears and personal nightmares. After becoming parents, all parents have the same, identical worst fear. A great unifier, totally shared experience, that one. 😱<br>

Happy ending! But not through institutional channels—rather, via out-of-band, semi-private ones. Glad for @krishnanrohit, but AI and cloud providers must do better. <br>
Retaining control over your life and well-being, not surrendering it to indifferent entities, is crucial. AI providers wield immense power over us, while we have little over them—a stark imbalance. This is why I support open-source, open-weights, open-thoughts, open-actions, ... and future open-AGI, and open-ASI... <br>
We can ill afford to not  internalise Sutton’s “Bitter Lesson,” or call it the “Iron Law of (Data, Compute),” where compute transforms data into intelligence and agency, leading to AGI and ASI. Restrictions on data copying must go. AI may seem risky, but going the non-AI route is orders of magintude riskier. Cheaper, easier AI will empower more people at society’s base. People like us! And reduce our dependence on the Musk and the Zucks and Darios, the barons of our times.<br>
Privacy concerns are often a red herring. Revealed preferences show we value privacy near zero, instinctively maximizing data sharing—a good thing. Oldie goodie book *Data for the People* by AI pioneer @aweigend, an early Amazon C.O., foresaw this data landscape accurately. I don’t prioritize privacy, b/c on a societal level, it hinders progress. Human intelligence is collective, and intelligence is the only antidote to our collective stupidity. Which will in the end get us—if we are not faster than that curse. (the daemon of human stupidity)<br>

True that—but that is not to say: those that are fortuitous enough to be in a position to run local, should not. They should absolutely run localhost, if they want to, assuming their own personal resources (cost, time, expertise) allow for it. I consider it—contributing tiny bit to the common pot of knowledge, capabilities, etc. Redundancy is the mother of robustness.<br>
I understand how much less efficient my roof solar + battery is compared to the national grid! It's quite cr*p tbh in comparison. Covers only 40% of my self-use, long periods of 0 in the winter etc. Still—I got lucky enough to be in a position to splurge on $15K on a bit of luxury to get modicum of independence: panels 5kw, battery 4kwh, invertor 3.6kw. And while I didn't earn anything much in RoE (payoff 10yrs - possibly?) - I would do it again. For redundancy, risk mitigation, for me and my nearest & dearest: if/when the rest of the UK grid disintegrates, I maybe able to provide some relief to myself (and my neighbours). <br>
Likewise, where ever possible and all things being equal—I try use local. If nothing else—to boost and encourage people working on open source, open weights. Latest GLM-4-32b-0414 as base, in Z=thinking and Rumination=deep research variants, runs at 7 bps on older M2 with enough RAM to hold the 20GB of weights, returning about GPT-4 quality. I will take that! 😆 Even if I can run faster and more convenient on the web gui.<br>
Hope the above makes sense. Thanks for reading this far a long post dear anon reader, whomever you maybe. 🥰<br>

Haha I do get it, 😂 I get that, and what you wrote too. These other considerations you mention - I get them. 😇  Just don't think it's needed to list *all* possible considerations, to put forward one consideration.

TBF for man, or at least myself, the Left dude will be my choice too. If I had to choose a companion, a team member, say embarking on a risky endeavour. I'd be thinking: probably strength wise about the same. Right dude is leaner more muscle per unit of body mass, more efficient - good. <br>
But being more self-centred self-important, the dude on the Right will be less team-first, less willing to take a hit for the team. And on a joint adventure - it's the team survival that's paramount. If the team survives - then some of us (maybe not all - but some) also survive. But if they team perishes - than all of us perish.<br>

😂 No one is perfect. Ian has been part of the establishment (and recognised as such!) for some time. Him denying it, will of course confirm that! 😂<br>
The insane indefensible cowardly stupid FAIL on the liberals' side over this one issue has already been noted several times, e.g. https://ft.com/content/b82bb503-21bb-4d64-8f72-6c6801f3b196<br>
It's a particular instance, of a more general ailment on their side, that can be surmised as " B U T    I S    I T    T R U E ". Afraid some more skeletons lurking in that closet for the chattering classes. More old indiscretions bills expect to be coming due for payments in near futures. (on - energy, climate, multiculti etc)<br>
Having said all that—ngl expecting your ahem opponent to be perfect, and then attacking them for failing short, feels kind of ceding too much to them unforced error; but hey - it is fun! 😆 (and we are all here for the lolz)<br>

Yep - most people are reflexively "pro-privacy" only when there is zero cost! Is my impression. And a revealed preference IRL, how much people are prepared to pay for it (almost zero), when they are actually asked to pay for it.<br>
I personally don't care much about privacy. When done on a societal level, it retards progress—at the most general. Human intelligence is collective. And intelligence is the only remedy I know of, that can upend our stupidity. (that is also collective.)<br>

Keeping control, not relinquishing total control over your person, your life, your wellbeing, to entities that care little about yourself - yep.<br>
Loving localhost open source, open weights, open thoughts, open actions, ...open AGI, open ASI - for that. 🥰<br>
Privacy reasons - imo again and again that's shown to be a red herring. I personally don't care that much. Preferences revealed when we are forced to put a price on how much we care about privacy - reveal that care quantifies close to zero. We usually lie when we say we care. And that's a good thing tbh, that we are instinctive data share maximalists even if unaware of it.<br>

Heh - California doomers have been insufferable for a long time now. Was compensated that other Californians put up plenty of $$$ to make things happen. And there seemed to be at least as many boosters and AI maximalists as there were doomers, if not more.<br>
Now new cleavage has opened v.v. China. Can't think of many less self-introspective people than Californians or US-ians. 😂 I like them for a bunch of things, but one can find more self-introspection in people high inhaling their own gases, possibly b/c their heads are up their own backsides! 😂<br>
Not only Ilya, but all 4 "grandfathers of AI" are European. The 3 that moved over to the Americas changed the world. And good on the good-ole-US-of-A for that, top marks!! For the 4th that stayed behind (nicely comfortable in his own lab?—how very European) has been reduced to yabbering schmidhubering from the back of the class! 😨<br>
Still—given that Europe decides to self-destroy about twice a century, 😱 one has to do with what one can gets. Play the cards they got to its best, not wait for the cards they would like to have got.<br>

Either they die off, (as is their wish,) or they learn a lesson. And while I won't be happy and think it a terrible loss, to them and us, if former rather than the latter transpires, in both cases they would at least leave the rest of us alone.<br>

It can't have escaped your knowledge, that while UK has the most commendable record when it comes to empiricism and rationalism, (and that's partly why this Johnny-the-foreigner now naturalised Brit is here and writing this,) UK also has a long tradition of religious nutters thinking fr the most insane things! Like the Taliban+ISIS then squared. And acting on their insanities too!<br>

There are plenty of people that will replace their own car, with on-demand 30 sec wait service, that is 99.99% reliable, if one was offered at the right price.<br>
I too get am bit sad seeing the car parked in front of the house 95% of the time, so we can use it when we need it that 5% of time. So car-as-service, sweat a very expensive asset, makes all  the sense in the world. However. TBS what happens.<br>
If EM is stupid-greedy, he will 1) start the service as good value 2) try to squeeze too much juice by compromising on timeliness and or price 3) try to squeeze more $$$ by shoving into people's throats sth they dislike - adverts, shared rides etc 4) people will rebel, say f*ck it I want my own, go back to personal cars.<br>
If EM is smart-greedy, he will do #1, but then instead of falling for the stupid 2-3-4-s, he will do the Amazon thing: zero profit, all growth.<br>

This GLM-4 local from yesterday looks like it should be able to? Variants are Z = reasoning, Rumination = deep research longer chains more time to do the job.<br>
Given it's equivalent to Deep Research and similar. Goes onto long chains of reasoning, and I would have hoped it's using the Internet, pulls pages from the Internet, maybe used python interpreter? If that is so - then it maybe capable of tools use. Only not sure if one can trigger access directly? Like "fetch this url://blah/blah".<br>

IDK you, but it seems to me I may have some inkling to what you are writing about.<br>
As 19 yo doing obligatory 1 yr national service (as it was then), a fellow recruit, perceptive and mostly honest, (we went along ok,) remarked to me "LJ you suffice to/for yourself alone. You are, you stay, alone." <br>
It struck me, for it had not occurred to me that everyone but myself, had already in the 3-6 months we 20-30 young man were in the barracks or outside on the grounds 24/7, formed cliques 2-3-4 persons strong. They spontaneously created groups structure. I was friendly to all, and all were friendly and well disposed to me - but I didn't belong to any small group. It had not occurred to me I should. I felt no need to either.<br>
Now IRL, whom am I really dependent on, for my physical and emotional welfare and fulfilment? <br>
I need to work, earn $$$ to keep my body supplied with water, food, warmth, shelter. So I need my workplace. <br>
I need to see talk hear, spend time with, be around, my wife and kids. That makes me happy, and conversely not doing it makes me sad. I need to talk to, and see my mum and my sister - mostly remote. (we live in different countries.) I need to write long posts like this to total strangers too. 😂 And read plenty of what they write, for they write so much, about many things that interest me. I'm loving that too. 🥰<br>
But - most of the neighbours, most acquaintances, most distant relatives, most of past and present colleagues we know of our  existence through work only, people I meet daily at the counters in the local shops and maybe recognise, online accounts that exist just as a small logo on my screen: we are independent of each other. Either side could disappear in a puff of smoke this second, and we would barely notice.<br>
And imo that's a good thing! True there is loneliness, but there is over socialisation on the other extreme too. So ask yourself: do you really need the "all of you", who might freak out? Probably you don't. For sure you don't seem to want to.<br>
So don't. Don't model ceaselessly, don't care that much about all. Make deliberate choices, what and whom you care about. And for the rest outside the boundary - train yourself to not care.<br>
From time to time take stock - are you happy with your boundary still? Change it where you are not. Change it without waiting where you feel urgency. Remember - your boundary is a rule of thumb. Not nothing, but not set in stone either. Redraw where you see a good reason to. Leave it be don't change it without a good reason.<br>
Many socialisation patterns with us are a leftover from the times when we people needed support from, and approval of, extended family or clan or village, for our wellbeing. It mixed personal and professional.<br>
Now that's bifurcated. We take more than ever, from ever greater number of people we will never know the existance of, on a purely transactional basis. Mostly to maintain our physical wellbeing. And we are closest then ever, to the ever smaller families we got. Mostly for our emotional wellbeing.<br>
Both expanded, at the expense of what can be described as "middling relationships". Groups like associations, clubs, political parties - those kinds of groupings. Their significance to our personal and professional lives imo declined relative to the "closest" and they "furthest" relationships bonds we form. Relatively to say how things were half a century ago. IDK why that is. Just a random observation.<br>

I heard (on a podcast) off-remark that TikTok is the 1st (and so far only) Social Media platform that has the algofeed driven (to non-trivial %age) based on the data/content, and *not* solely on the metadata. The implication was that is the reason their algofeed is pre-naturally good. Users often feel it almost super-natural in predicting what the user wants. Not used it—but registered for this.<br>
Do you know anything about that? This stuff interests me.<br>
IDK fs but imagine the Twitter format (X and Bsky) might be ripe for disruption. By now I think evidence is clear that using largely meta-data to predict "will user Y want to see post Z, yes/no", simply leads to positive feedback loop of a winner-takes-all type. Small number of creators-writers on one side, many in number readers-consumers on the other. Still old 1:N one way interaction, re-creating the now mostly dead Mass Media MSM setup predating it.<br>
1st Twitter now X algofeed has always been cr*p to me. Not claiming it's worse now—but wd have expected it to get better in 10 yrs. But no—X algofeed is as sh*t as always. Have to battle it left and right, and manually find mostly what I want.<br>
IMO it persists—and fake accounts persistence forever also consequence of this—that it's not all bad news for the platforms. They don't mind creating-differentiating 1K-10K accounts as tier-1 ("content creators"), as then they can influence those small number of accounts (who also maybe $$$ dependent on the platform) whichever way. Much harder to steer 100M accounts (that you have little leverage over, as you don't pay them) in whichever direction is desired by the platform owners.<br>
I'm tired of it, b/c the SNR is low, wastes everyone's time - incl Zucks and Musks - for nothing for near-zero marginal gain. Maybe we get lucky and ByteDance create TextTalk, a "short text quanta of ideas" format social media platform?? 😂<br>

Afaik zero rich countries have small state. Small say arbitrary cut-off <10%. Rich countries in the sense they create very complicated gadgets, or provide sophisticated services. Not in a sense of—they dig dirt from the ground and sell it for big $$$.<br>
IDK why that is. Afaik no one does, one only speculates. Maybe something to do with a need of great amount of synchronisation, order and predictability, to facilitate the right fractions of cooperation-vs-competition interactions in every area, among ever increasing number of peoples?? IDK. I much wish I knew more.<br>

Suffer in silence. 😂 Life is tough for very many people, b/c they can't understand easily the world around them. They are lacking in their h/w, and subsequently s/w. Leaving aside the thunder Q: saw once good documentary on how it is for a person to live while being at the bottom 2.5% percentile by IQ. The bloke was normal, mostly decent. Like one of those "put on a suit that adds 40kg to your weight for 24h, to feel how it is to live as a fat person". Very very instructive! Filling a form was an ordeal. Being asked ordinary questions at a counter in some gov office, induced terrors of fear and panic, for the sheer embarrassment what the person on the other side of the glass, as well as everyone else behind in the queue, will shortly find out about yourself. The guy had a wife. They seemed to mostly love or like and support each other, and get by. (she was somewhat better then him on the IQ %age scale) It was an excellent window into a life different to what most people live.<br>

I good chunk of the ruling class can be replaced by the latest ChatGPT-type reasoning models. The two podcast dudes are not smart enough for the amount of time spent in public talking their mouths off, and they also hallucinate a lot. Not unlike ChatGPT-3.5!<br>
There are existing reasoning models that do better than Alister and Rory. Further. Models can be "frozen" and audited. Models are continuously improved. Models are moral—do not usually lie nor cheat. Politicians' profession of making decisions affecting us all, should be one of the first to be turned over to AI-s.<br>

If you were not already overextended with more campaigns ongoing than is humanly possible to pursue, 😆 I'd have said "go for radical transparency campaign". But that is more meta-, not something concrete, so probably don't bother. Still—can't resist trying to put the idea out there in people heads, 😅 so here goes.<br>
All UK gov data and code should be online, on github .gov .uk. For anyone to see and browse to their hearts desire. And randos online may even help manual data checking for silly f*ckups. The kinds of errors that are most difficult to weed out in data!<br>
Every one file produced by UK gov departments should be put, as read only, on public cloud drives, and or on the public web—as default! And made secret upon specific request only. Everyone should just be able to google anything—no FOI requests needed. Rather than "secrecy by default" and things made public only 1) at gov will 2) at FOI request, (and oft frustrated by the bureaucracy in execution,) with everything public by default secrets will be closed off only by request.<br>
I imagine Sir Humphries will be having heart attacks at the thought of such idea. 😀 Admit I have no idea how we get to that blessed state of affairs. But I think it necessary, on part of the state towards us citizens, and also businesses towards us their consumers. This in order to address and redress the current information imbalance. Because information leads to knowledge leads to power.<br>
The conventional opinion is that the power imbalance coming from the information imbalance (state/business know a lot about me; I know little about them) is that us citizens and consumers should reduce our "information surface" towards them. And address the imbalance that way. But.<br>
There exists another, often unmentioned option. And that option is for state/business to open up, to increase their "information surface" towards us, their citizens/consumers. That will also achieve information (and one hopes power) rebalance. Every time it's actually measured, how much value we put on our privacy, when we have to weight privacy against convenience and other gains from more data sharing, the revealed preference is close to zero! Revealed preference is that we put the value of our privacy close to zero, despite forever saying otherwise.<br>
So the option of state/business revealing more data to us citizens/consumers, is actually more realistic. Yes there is extra work on part of state/business to open their data to us. But it's worth it. The more advanced the society, the more synchronisation it needs to achieve the right cooperation-competition balance of the interaction between ever greater numbers of people.<br>
There is an old book "Data For the People" by an early AI pioneer and Amazon CTO @aweigend. Afaics it well describes the world we live in, and also are likely to live even more in the future. Dear reader, ☺️ thank you for persevering reading this far, and I hope this makes sense to you.<br>

Maybe we should put more emphasis on a bias called "laziness". That used to be common knowledge, that as a default, we are lazy. And rightly so! Inactivity status quo, is preferred to activity. As activity imposes certain costs now, only to be maybe offset (and more) by uncertain benefits in the future, yet to be accrued.<br>
So while it's right and proper to have proposals tested, trashed looked for weak points, for signs of wishful thinking etc. It's also true that if one is lazy, as one is by default, one can find plenty of arguments why anything proposed will not work as proposed, will have weak points, or may go badly wrong in million possible ways. It's a narrow sweet spot to thread even at best of times, and with best of intentions tbh.<br>

We need some kind of crypto setup for market of ideas. Where they are not exchanged for $$$ to start with. But are exchanged like-for-like, ideas-for-ideas in the 1st instance. Or ideas for IC - Idea Coin, the currency of the place. Then latter as whole, on an IC currency zone level, then they maybe exchanged for $$$ if one needs $$$ to live maintain functioning body and mind.<br>
For one needs breadth - orders of magnitude more than one came dream up come up with, and also risk sharing - at the time of conception, hard to tell a good from a bad idea apart, that is mostly determined by the future yet to happen. Maybe sth like—my posts are my stuff, I create them I own them, even if everyone is free to copy and share, even only for the process of valuation. Valuation determined by by judgement of others ex-I: everyone ex-I is free to vote with their IC wallets, by buying and selling my post. (or stay indifferent)<br>
It will help intellectuals in another way too: it will ground the ideas in reality. Atm too many are free to propose whatever tickles their fancy, and that (e.g. communism) unchecked by much testing, is put into production by assorted psychopaths and tyrants (Lenin, Stalin) to detriment of all. E.g. would have been much better if CC - Communism Coin - had the initial pop. But then didn't appreciate much in value after the initial pop, and died off in obscurity.<br>

Oh man! 😂 Comedy gold. 😂<br>
The "UK ministry of justice buying Porsche cars for Albania" was also rich in comedic value! 😂 Did you see it? Was on recently. (with the Motability or sth?)<br>
The real story (from recollection) was: UK Ministry of Justice tries to offload convicted ALB criminals serving sentences in UK jails, to free prison spaces. For ALB is only obliged to take them back once they served their sentences, and are deported back. But not before. UK - sensibly imo in the circumstance - is financing prison places in ALB ,to move them over earlier. (they can serve the sentence in part in ALB; cheaper) Trying to sweeten the deal so ALB Ministry of Justice bites, UK FCO throws in some car donations. (money well spent imo, considering, comparative) About 30K per car, but has to be an EV, b/c UK green Laws. Plenty of Mercedes ICE choices in ALB, but EV dealers thin on the ground. One more reputable being Porsche Albania! You see where this goes. 😂 Next thing—UK news: "UK Ministry of Justice financing buying Porsches for Albanians!" 😂<br>

We can't go on like this. Sophist wordcels, with zero real world expertise outside academia or politics, having climbed  and retained greasy poles inside parties, (total snake pits where the most sociopathic only survives then thrives,) very much ignorant of, and disinterested in, things they decide on, (impossible to know what's going in anyone's head, including the minister on display,) with poor morals, affecting lives of millions fellow citizens, with disregard to fellow citizens wellbeing, without much feedback.<br>

You have researchers, less and worse ones maybe lately but researchers never the less, you have access to Internet, and lately AI Research tools. To air as if Tabula Rasa empty vessel, filled with anything your guest dreams up, and simply re-broadcast - well then: it's the British Telecom we are talking about, not British Broadcasting! Broadcasting among other things is to educate and inform!<br>

But more companies -> more supply and more competition -> reduced prices, no? And isn't one of the features of any taxation "we will get less of that of what we tax"? (all other things being equal) Agreed it has but become impossible, in n hugely complicated system that energy one has been made in the UK over the past decades, to judge with much certainty what outcome we get, for any lever that is pulled.<br>

Maybe tad on the tail end of that, but a lot feels like the usual business of governing a country. We just get to see how the sausage is made, even if not intentionally! 😂 It comes naturally to the current team-Orange-clown. 🤡 When running a circus, the spectators are a big bigly uuge part of the Big Tent. 🤪<br>
Fwiw—I'm all for it! For the lolz, but also b/c I think more state transparency is needed. Insufficient transparency makes any feedback hard, and without feedback it's hard to improve anything.<br>
I advocate for radical transparency on part of the state towards us citizens, and businesses towards us their consumers. In order to address and redress the current information imbalance. Information leads to knowledge leads to power.<br>
The conventional opinion is that the power imbalance coming from the information imbalance (state/business know a lot about me; I know little about them) is that us citizens and consumers should reduce our "information surface" towards them. And address the imbalance that way. But.<br>
There exists another, often unsaid option. And that option is for state/business to open up, to increase their "information surface" towards us. That will also achieve information (and one hopes power) balance. Every time it's actually measured, how much value we put on our privacy, when we have to weight privacy against convenience and other gains from more data sharing, the revealed preference is close to zero. Revealed preference is that we put the value of our privacy close to zero, despite forever saying otherwise.<br>
So the option of state/business revealing more data to us citizens/consumers, is actually more realistic. Yes there is extra work on part of state/business to open their data to us. But it's worth it. The more advanced the society, the more synchronisation it needs to achieve the right cooperation-competition balance of the interaction between ever greater number of people.<br>
There is an old book "Data For the People" by an early AI pioneer and Amazon CTO @aweigend. Afaics it well describes the world we live in, and also are likely to live even more in the future. Dear reader, ☺️ thank you for reading thus far, hope this makes sense to you.<br>
RADICAL TRANSPARENCY FTW<br>

They are not the enemy—but their incompetence is making lives of millions miserly. DOGE is a reaction to a huge FAIL of the state capacity. There is no point in preserving of much that DOGE is cutting. That has already died, has been dead for some time. DOGE are like I cutting dead branches in the garden.<br>
State capacity sure has a role! A role to organise and marshal resources on gargantuan scales. To take gargantuan risks! That no other organisation in society can afford to take on, and live to see the end of those risks, the ultimate payoffs. (or survive the fails.) For that, it is the State that is the ultimate resource.<br>
There are no rich countries with small states. There are no peoples that to better their lives, don't organise as a State first and foremost. I come from a startup Nation, and a startup State. And a startup literary language too! All these things go together. All are technologies where large groups of people come together to better their lives.<br>
And no one should begrudge them that after spending decades, even centuries in the wilderness, if they find a path through their valleys of tears, to their promised lands. As long as all that is towards building lands of milk and honey. (or even "life, liberty and pursuit of happiness") And not murdering other peoples like yours, next to you.<br>
(for something to exists, as a separate entity from it's environments, needs a separator, a separation, and that is provided by force, by violence; State monopoly on violence, external and internal, is the technology humanity has discovered over time)<br>
Yes, "Your Country is not a Business" is a good reading now as ever. Musk will fail not because his instincts are wrong—but because building a State requires institutions, not cults. He knows of using the strength and cult of personality, and that is all fine and good. But that suffices and works in small high-performant self-motivated narrow-aim organisations. That will not work for State capacity. Expect Musk to be out sooner rather than latter, and what little dent was made towards change, will be undone within weeks.<br>
Yours "more State always and forever" has FAIL mode ofc. Argentina was that. There what Milei does is obviously going to change things for the better for time being. I grew up in a late-socialism country, that on paper you being similarly ideological would have liked. But in real life would have hated it. For nothing worked, for nothing could be done, for the simple reason that everything was forbidden. A country decided to freeze any efforts of its citizens towards betterment of their own lives.<br>
Subsequently when a reformer unfroze it, just let the natural energies and talents of the citizenry flow, life improved magnitudes and in very short time. Seemingly without special knowledge and super-human effort. Just millions of tiny ants, doing millions of tiny tasks, that need doing for ages. Previously the ants were forbidden to do them. And now the ants were free to do them on their own. That was it.<br>
More humility is in order considering the scales and the consequences of State failures. Especially on ideas coming from intellectuals, which of course you are in part. Do you never read e.g. Thomas Sowell on intellectuals, and think "hm, there is empirical evidence that he may have a point?" Did the fact that big state socialism crash and burn everywhere in your own lifetime somehow got erased from your memory? Or "Big Green Tech" idea both hitting problems with the tech, and not delivering the jobs. I'm baffled by the ego at work here tbh.<br>

...but more linked. I get the impression normies mostly get embarrassed (why??) and just shutdown their thinking faculties.<br>
With Blair still with us and as enthusiastic about them as ever (The world of TB: no problem exists that a national-ID card does not solve), this flares from time to time so I pipe up. The strongest hope I got tbh is that public inertia and gov incompetence will save us from making the mistake of introducing national ID cards. Rather than some superior public discussion and decision making process.<br>

I wanted to try Gemini for its longer context.<br>
Architect mode - for that I use aider, it has separate architect and writer roles. For DeepSeek it's<br>
aider-deepseek-best() { local -; set -x; aider --set-env AIDER_START="$(date)" --architect --model deepseek/deepseek-reasoner --editor-model deepseek/deepseek-chat; }<br>
I believe atm reasoner points R1, and chat points V3. One can select the versions explicitly too. But then e.g. once R2 is released, I presume reasoner will be re-pointed to R2, while if I select by explicit name, I have to change the scripts.<br>
You can see (performance,price) and setups here <br>
<a href="https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/">https://aider.chat/docs/leaderboards/</a><br>
So OpenAI top in performance and price. Then for a bit less performance, Gemini is 1/10-th the price. Then a little less performance again , and one gets DeepSeek for 1/2 or 1/3 of Gemini price.<br>
I try them all from time to time, esp on a new module or project. I have not got a good reason to keep trying. I just love this stuff. Brings a smile to my face, ngl. 😇<br>

Ah - and I thought I had it bad with me writing into the void. 😂 After reading of your predicament - I think myself lucky! No replies better than aggravating braindead replies, fs! ngl 😇<br>
I heard (on a podcast) off-remark that TikTok is the 1st (and so far only) Social Media platform that has the algofeed driven (to non-trivial %age) based on the data/content, and *not* solely on the metadata. The implication was that is the reason their algofeed is prenaturally good. Users often feel it almost super-natural in predicting what the user wants. Not used it—but heading off to register after I post this.<br>
1st Twitter now X algofeed has been cr*p to me, always. Not claiming it much worse now. But wd have expected it to get better in 10 yrs?? But no—X algofeed is as sh*t as always. Have to battle it left and right to manually find what I want. I rarely see anything you post.<br>
IDK fs but imagine the Twitter format (X and Bsky) might be ripe for disruption. By now I think it's clear using largely meta-data to predict "will user Y want to see post Z, yes/no", simply leads to positive feedback loop of a winner-takes-all type. Small number of creators-writers on one side, many in number readers-consumers on the other. The old v1 Social Media, harking back to the Mass Media MSM setup predating it.<br>
That's not all bad news for the platforms. (they think) They don't mind creating differentiating 1K-10K accounts as tier-1 ("content creators"), as that they can then influence whichever way. Much harder to steer 100M accounts in the direction desired by the platform owners. Incentives incentives.<br>
I'm personally tired of it, b/c SNR is low. It's a waste of everyone's time, incl Zucks and Musks, and for zero marginal gain. TikTok showed that. Maybe we get lucky and ByteDance create TextTalk, a Twitter format social media platform. 😂<br>

You've got 2-3yrs to get the prices down. Not down by 10% or sth inconsequtial, but to at least halve the retail electricity price. What thick thick skulls you greenies got. God only knows how Suneil deals with you dunderheaded cretins.<br>

IDK. But given UK gov refusal to change the scheme, I suspect UK gov has some advice somewhere to prevent change. Something like "risk of blackouts, expected XX dead". I don't see how removing the marginal pricing impacts any unreliables. Afaik unreliables prices are almost all fixed in advance contracts.<br>
Would dearly like to know. So from time to time I spam whoever is in the vicinity RADICAL TRANSPARENCY FTW spam 😂<br>

Energy security is my favourite guess—but also only one, got not better one.<br>
I notice that every winter, we nudge the margin of slack ever lower. One of these winters when the stars align bad (=enough faults happen at the same time, by random chance) we will get to catastrophic nation-wide blackout. Of the type when UK has to resort to the Dinorwig to bootstrap its National Grid back online from a total power-off. With people stranded on trains overnight, dozens in ICU dead with machines cutting off after generators run out of diesel some hours into the blackout.<br>

I have the X previously Twitter notification enabled at the user account level. But phone, app,  browser etc notifications are disabled of course. When I check X either via Web browser or App, I see the blue badge with number of notifications on the bell 🔔 icon on the interface. (bottom of the page in the Web browser) If I feel like it, I check to see what they are about. (if the number looks high.) If I don't feel like it, or I see small numbers 2-3 on the badge - then I don't bother checking. They will be in the Notifications web page next time I check my feed too.

Many have noticed that we are ruled more by algorithms, than humans like the plebs we are, already. 😂 SirKS feels to me an algorithm in action, embodied in a human body. And I don't begrudge SirKS anything - he's done well, his algo-politico algorithm worked well! SirKS occupies one of the top offices in the land. <br>
As one takes stock of things on St Georges day, looks to the past, then turns the gaze to the future, we try to diving things. For all its excellent qualities my adopted country possesses - and these are many!! ngl-UK is top top place to be in, and long may it continue and prosper - can't help but notice certain problems with the political system. The people we select then elect for high office, have come short of expectations in the recent years.<br>
AI ChatGPT to the rescue then!<br>
Am not entirely unserious there. Would AI be more truthful than SirKS? Almost certainly. Would AI do more work? Sure - just deploy to 10000 servers in data centers across this green and pleasant land, and let them run!<br>
AI should successfully replicate what we got now. We  lose nothing! The AI-(SirKS) prompt (objective function) might be: "Strive for zero or at least minimal risk. You desire to do nothing, you will not change anything. Risk is the only axis left to you to optimise on-strive for zero risk  at all times". If things fall short of expectation, we can always go back to the old/current "algopolitico in a human body" system.<br>
AI advantage is that it can be frozen in time, interrogated, and made as transparent as we wish. On this issue, AI could tell us: "I don't care much wither way. I have not got a strong opinion on this. As is my default stance in cases like this, I would like to make the least number of people the least unhappy, with any decision I make. I will make a decision only if forced to make one by events thrust onto me." Sounds much better to me, than the usual hare-brained word salad we have come to expect from a bog standard human SirKS and clones.<br>
(RADICAL TRANSPARENCY of UK gov towards us UK citizens is another campaign dear to my heart.)<br>
I get it people worry about "AI existential risk". Yeah there is some-but there is plenty of risk now, existential too, with humans! Who do we think will sooner start thermo-nuclear war: Trump-Putin, or ChatGPT??<br>

It's futile to complain as is per the incentives.<br>
Incentives that come from the state of the algofeed technology I imagine. Where I suspect it's 100% meta-data driven, and 0% data-content driven.<br>
I heard (on a podcast) off-remark that TikTok is the 1st (and so far only) Social Media platform that has the algofeed driven (to non-trivial %age) based on the data/content, and *not* solely on the meta-data. The implication was that is the reason their algofeed is so so good. Almost super-natural in predicting what the user wants.<br>
IDK but imagine the Twitter format (X and Bsky) is ripe for disruption. The algofeed has been cr*p for me always. Not claiming it's much worse now. Wd have expected to get better in 10yrs? But no-X algofeed is sh*t for me, as always. Have to battle it left and right to find what I want. Most of the time ton of manual work.<br>

Good—great! Would you consider advocating for RADICAL TRANSPARENCY of UK gov towards the Great British public?<br>
I advocate for radical transparency on part of the state towards us citizens, and businesses towards us their consumers. In order to address and redress the current information imbalance. Information leads to knowledge leads to power.<br>
The conventional opinion is that the power imbalance coming from the information imbalance (state/business know a lot about me; I know little about them) is that us citizens and consumers should reduce our "information surface" towards them. And address the imbalance that way. But.<br>
There exists another, often unsaid option! And that option is for state/business to open up, to increase their "information surface" towards us. That will also achieve information (and we hope power) balance! Every time it's actually measured, how much value ourselves put on our privacy, when we have to weight our privacy, against convenience and other gains from more data sharing, the revealed preference is close to zero. Revealed preference is that we put the value of our privacy close to zero, despite saying otherwise.<br>
So the option of state/business revealing more data to us citizens/consumers, is actually more realistic. Yes there is extra work on part of state/business to open their data to us. But it's worth it! The more advanced the society, the more synchronisation it needs to achieve the right cooperation-competition balance of the interactiona between ever greater number of people!<br>
There is an old book "Data For the People" by an early AI pioneer and Amazon CTO @aweigend. Afaics it well describes the world we live in, and also are likely to live even more in the future. Thank you for reading thus far, hope this makes sense to you.<br>

Afaik that's not entirely possible. I have the following mental model of SocMed algofeeds. I can expect any one post I write to be shown to max 1/10-th of my followers, in the best case. How and why? The simplest possible example I can think of is this.<br>
I follow 5000 accounts. Each one writes 1 post a day = 5000 posts per day. I login to X, X algofeed serves me 50 posts on one screen full. I check X 10 times per day = 500 posts that X will show me in one day. That is 500 out of possible 5000 to be shown. And so there will be 4500 posts, from people I follow on any one day, to **not** be shown.<br>
X must decide which 500, out of 5000 possible, to show me. So any one post has probability 0.1 to be shown. I will see 1 post from 1 account once in 10 days. IRL the algofeed will be vastly more complicated. The algofeed is the core of the social media company.<br>
Unlike the sketch above, the algofeed is non-random. It mostly uses metadata to tilt that 0.1 probability. Algofeed tilts towards factors like timeliness/age "how much time elapsed since a post got posted", engagement measures like how many in number {Like, Forward, Quote, Reply} interactions it got, probably all decayed by time with some half-life.<br>
Afaik no actual data about the quality, the content, of the post is ever used. Only metadata. This is pure speculation on my part. I have no insider knowledge. I have not worked in a social media company ever. Just thinking aloud and considering rules of thumb and first principles.<br>
For me personally posting. Usually I only have the "View"-s for a post to see as a feedback. I don't even know if it was shown to the user whose message I reply to! (@perrymetzger in this instance) It's entirely up to X algofeed, if/when it shows it to the OP, or not at all. If a post gets zero engagement (a "Like" at a minimum) after 30-50 Views, it's subsequently dropped. (never pushed any more to anyone's screen.)<br>
One would need to go to my home page on X, then search for a post intentionally. E.g. like so <br>
<a href="https://x.com/search?q=(from%3Aljupc0)&src=typed_query&f=live">https://x.com/search?q=(from%3Aljupc0)&src=typed_query&f=live</a><br>
It's possible that my idea of how things work is entirely faulty. Allow for that pls. I'm no social media star-can hardly give advice to anyone! 😆<br>

No one cares. Stopped listening to any JRE many moons ago. There are plenty better out there. It's easy. We live in un-imaginable data abundance times. ☺️<br>
Joe became too big for the kind of low level work that matters. Seems he thinks it's beneath him. Fine. I guess that happens with many Millions of listeners lending you their ears. No need to kill oneself with effort.<br>
For myself-there's plenty of other fish in the sea, YT podcasters to see. YT channels are full of UKR-RUS content. More from Ukraine, less from Russia - as they seem to be somewhat more keen on total control - but still doable.<br>
And so and plenty podcasters do it, do good work roaming about, showing and talking about what they experience. Lend them your attention. Joe has had his cup full already. Needs not more of the same.<br>

Worse-you only hear from frustrated people that tried and failed to use it. The ones for whom "it just works", keep shtum, as they have no reasons to complain. Once it works for the previously disgruntled-they stop posting their frustrations too.<br>
We typically come online when something is ailing us, and voice our gripes. I don't post on X: another day of vim doing as per my :commands, Chrome did it's thing no problems, git --obeyed orders too, and bash worked well {today} as it did in the past 30yrs.<br>

Indeed - that is true, if it was a propaganda tour.<br>
Why would it be though? Joe could just go, and roam, and record and comment what he sees, to his heart content. In person or incognito hidden.<br>
Plenty of people do, the YT channels are full of content. More from Ukraine, less from Russia - as they seem to be somewhat more keen on total control - but still possible. Plenty good podcasters doing good work.<br>

Thanks. I'm all for open data open everything, esp for gov RADICAL TRANSPARENCY every gov business open to the public as default and closed by request.<br>
I write software that does quadratic optimisation setups for a living and run Mosek frequently. Glad to read the guy is talking about optimisation.<br>
Having said that-the proof of the pudding is in the eating. Overcoming the evidence of prior 20 yrs of policies resulting in UK ending with the highest electricity prices among the peers is no small feat. All the while increasing the fraction of unreliables in the mix.<br>
A quarter of UK chemical industry disappearing, possibly as a result of high energy prices in the UK, affects me personally too. So-I'm ill-inclined to give the proponents of the current system much of my time. They had their go at things-the results are what we pay today.<br>

Indeed, you are 100% right. Autistic people are in greater danger than most to seek clever schemes that "solve everything" in one neat formula, leaving no lose ends. My wife works with kids like them. From the stories anecdotes relayed from time to time-I see how and why this wd be the case. While there have been plenty of evil humanist-by-education dudes in history, I always have in mind that one of the greatest recent monsters Beria "excelled in math and science".<br>
This tongue-in-cheek "VDT: a solution to decision theory" https://lesswrong.com/posts/LcjuH on a related topic (HT https://x.com/ChrisChipMonk/status/191323296) maybe of interest. My reading was 1) Less frivolous than it first appears; 2) Not obviously worse than the alternatives; 3) Well even-problem solved again, with prior art being "Vibes==Love" in our (christian?) culture afaics.<br>
[[[ Meta. Don't apologise please. I like to read what you write, I follow you and you follow me, yet frequently X does not show me what you wrote. The above post is great. Twitter now X algofeed was always cr*p, and is still cra*p. Please re-post more of your old posts! Fight low quality low effort algofeed with low effort means to maintain. Maintaining good SNR justifies it!<br>
My unfounded suspicion is X algofeed is sh*t in a way that it places almost all the probability weight on the "timeliness" predictor, and almost nothing on anything else. And esp nothing on content i.e. data - it's all about meta-data. Afaik all X algofeed predictors to "should I show post Y to user Z" are meta-data only, and none are data actual content.<br>
I heard on a podcast - that I can't find, may have been one done by the two Abundance book guys promoting the book, but don't recall which - and one of them (or the host?) mentioned this. That TikTok is the 1st social media algofeed that doesn't (unfairly) prioritise meta-data. But looks at the actual data, at the actual content. Of both what is posted, and what the user consumes i.e. wants. And that it actually matches that. And that's the reason people find TikTok almost super-natural in guessing what they want.<br>
For utilising meta-data simply leads to positive feedback loop of winner-takes-all. Which is not all bad news for the platforms. They don't mind creating differentiating 1K-10K accounts as "content creators", that they can then influence whichever way. Much harder to steer 100M accounts in the direction desired by the platform owners.<br>
If the above about the TikTok algofeed were true. I'd get the urge to bash our SocMed overlords with a heavy object over their heads. For wasting Bazillion of hours of human lives, to feed us slop, and for their own detriment, and ours. The very definition of human stupidity. Unexcusable on the part of the Zucks and Musks. /rant ]]]<br>

I don't reject it as impossible, maybe. But he-says-she-says is weak evidence for me. Need to see the data that is your evidence.<br>
When all is added and subtracted, I want to see the price I myself pay for energy halve. In the past 10 years, I have seen that price about double. This is a very troubling and disappointing direction of travel. I blame the policies that have been in place in the past 20 years, for that disappointing outcome.<br>

Hm - I have been luckier than that so far I must say. What's your setup?<br>
I'm using aider atm, current best-but-expensive is<br>
aider-openai-best() { local -; set -x; env AIDER_START="$(date)" aider --architect --model openai/o3 --editor-model openai/gpt-4.1 --openai-api-key ${OPENAI_API_KEY} ; }<br>
All the while trying all the other tools (Cursor, Windsurf, addons Cline and Roo for VSCode) from time to time.<br>
Last week it was Gemini and DeepSeek that I used. They wrote me 95% code of a boring module in a language I can read but not write super comfortably yet. I could have done it manually, bit this was more fun. My current best process is 1) write into INSTRUCTIONS-dot-md (that unlike in-chat instructions can go in git as documentation too); then 2) tell aider "read instructions from file xxx, then do as instructed".<br>
This was prob v7 of the same functionality I have done over the years in a coterie of languages. So not only did I know what needs doing and how, buy I also knew of the likely fails, and dangerous corners. Enough to be anticipating some and preemptively describing, as well as being on a lookout for likely logical errors. (LLM makes no syntax errors??) All in all - good experience, will repeat.<br>
Anyways - just came to your TL to say I loved listening to your "Reinforcement Learning, by the Book" series, it is excellent. Thanks for making it and sharing it with the world.<br>

Random observation. For all their faults, the UK elites running the British Empire were forever outward looking almost to a fault. Maybe it helps that the United Kingdom is in itself 3.5 nations too.<br>
In contrast, the US elites educated in the best Unis of the land (Ivy Leagues? etc), seem forever inward looking, parochial, ill informed. It puzzles me to a lot. Americans I've met in the US have been nothing but open or even keen to talk about anything, and open minded. US-ians abroad I have interacted with, have also been open and curious, not closed to experience. (as long as one does not criticise outright their native lands; and that's fine, we are like that, myself included)<br>
How is it then, that just the US-based elites commanding the heights of the country, are so painfully not-self-aware. I fail to understand.<br>

Nothing personal this—but I will cut my loss at this point. For writing to someone who refuses to read, is something I want to repeat with this very message at most once, but not more than once. Sorry the interaction didn't work out. Not your fault, no one is at fault—but blocked now. So I'm not tempted to interact again with in the future.

Of course - and expect nothing else in the future too.<br>
In my lifetime, AIDS stopped being a deadly disease, and no one noticed.<br>
I was ~20yo when I 1st heard about AIDS in the media. A positive test was a death sentence. Newspapers went on and on, with some celebrity dieing every week or month, for years. Innuendos, real and fake news, of "are they or aren't they" HIV positive, filled newspapers pages. For years.<br>
Then I noticed at some point - wait, we are not reading these stories any more. No celebrity had died of AIDS within my memory window. I dug up info - there was Internet by then. Found out the illness is treated, and turned Chronic, away from Acute. People suffer but they are not dieing en masse. There's a documentary "In the time of a plague" or similar about the drugs development. Nowadays I presume it's curred completely, can't be bothered to check now.<br>
Ulcers to the stomach also got cured in my lifetime. In my childhood, sometimes I'd overhear parents talk in grave voice "So-and-rushed to an operating theatre to hospital, but couldn't be saved. Burst ulcer bleeding, tsk tsk. Such tragedy - family kids lost father etc". Then in my adulthood I realised - I never hear of such tragedies anymore. Found out the saga of Helicobacter and the Australian doctor(s). That Ulcers are cured by antibiotics, and people don't typically die of burst ulcers anymore.<br>
So yeah - a deadly plague killing people left and right will be solved, problem deleted, an impossible feat achieved. After decades of effort, of trials and failures, by thousands of people across the globe. Few people will notice.<br>

YT is destroying Hollywood as well as TV productions for me. Watching them is boring and tedious. Takes ages for them to get to the point. It's like after listening to podcasts to x1.5 speed, going back to x0.9 speed.<br>
In the Mr Beast Productions Manual for new hires, that circulated online some time ago, Mr Beast writes about this phenomenon. That YT is higher intensity, higher SNR, than classical productions. And that's in his opinion will become bigger than all if them together are now.<br>

When one reads "How Innovation Works" or "Serendipity: Medical Discoveries in the 20th Century" one gets to appreciate how much luck plays a role. Many breakthroughs are in parts very much accidental.<br>
We do disservice to young researchers there. When we write up a discovery, we usually start from the end, from the result, and mentally trace the path back to the start. Then we describe that one path we traced back, with words, from the start to the end.<br>
But that single forward path is an illusion! At discovery time, at the start, and along the path, there were many junctions. Going forward, there is a tree of paths - never a single one. The ultimate path that worked, was one of many. It only exists when looking back, from the end result. Often it is not even clear why we decided to follow one fork, and not another. Usually there are arguments evidence for-, as well as against-, taking either path, in a fork on the road. (to the ultimate discovery.)<br>
Further, timing is everything. Kurzeil -  now famously - stumbled on his Flops/USD log-linear exponential trying to figure how to time his Inventions/contraptions. (his words-I think?) Hinton probably had Sutskever-level PhD students in year 2003, or even 1993 too. There were no GPU-s capable of a leap then probably. Even when there were GPU-s, it took an Alex, in addition to one Ilya, to be at the same place, same time.<br>
(for comparison: in year 2000, a stellar guy in my lab training NN-s and writing ASR stack decoders, had a special Sparcstation bough with large chunk of project $$$, with then obscene unheard of I think 96 MB RAM; most users had computers with 2MB RAM from recollection)<br>
Research is a mugs game. Some Hinton colleagues probably died never seeing the success of their field. Assuming all their efforts a failure, a waste good for nothing. After devoting good chunk of their lives to it.<br>

Happened to me, python comments switched to Cyrillic. Presume RUS—but maybe other languages, dozens languages use Cyrillic variants. At other time it switched to French comments! Added in my INSTRUCTIONS md file "write your comments in English"—that fixed it, not repeated since.<br>

Think @skdh nailed this one—this may work fr. Stellarators producing fields without needing insides current, continuous running, trading that for more complex magnets. Open sourcing too adds to confidence.<br>

Yes—the complaints are spot on. Glad someone is motivated enough cares enough to react. (I don't)<br>
1) Selective booking.<br>
Fine, bring on fringe guests if you must. But then at least include voices from both sides. Joe’s "crazies" are almost exclusively pro-Russia or pro-Hamas. And it's not just about balance—even non-crazy prominent figures like Vitali Klitschko (boxing champ, now mayor of Kyiv) literally sent Joe a video invitation to appear and was ignored. Can’t think of a more JRE-suited guest, frankly.<br>
That Joe refuses to platform any strong pro-Ukraine or pro-Israel voices speaks of his views. It's his right—but let us remember: the original fail mode of MSM was selective bias by omission. Joe, now a platform as big as MSM, deserves the same scrutiny. You can't call it "open dialogue" if only one side ever gets airing to millions.<br>
2) Churchill the baddie.<br>
Joe and guests pushing Churchill conspiracies are—maybe without realising it, for they are forever ignorant even to click on a Wiki page—rehashing 1942 Goebbels propaganda ("Churchill controlled by Jewish bankers," etc). In Europe, WW2 survivors are still alive (e.g. my mum). These takes aren’t edgy—they’re lazy.<br>
Fr: it was Germany that built up its military in defiance of Versailles, annexed Austria, dismembered Czechoslovakia, and invaded Poland on Sept 1, 1939. Two weeks later, the Soviet Union invaded Poland from the east, pursuant to the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, a plan to divide Eastern Europe between Germany and the Soviet Union. Enslave and or exterminated millions of people. This is not disputed. We have mountains of evidence—hand written from the architects and executors(!), diaries, state memos, radio archives, press coverage. Everyone can read everything at all times, it's not Latin or ancient Greek. It's all super-accessible. Even the original archives.<br>
Joe is free to re-broadcast Goebbels-tier takes. But let’s not pretend it’s deep or brave. If he wants to test the strength of his opinions, let him say this stuff in CEEurope (ex-Russia), in Poland or the Baltics. I suspect he may catch more heat than he can handle. He's travelled a long way from the original "savage Khan of the steppe curious about the skies asks medicine man to explain" schtick, and something got lost along the way.<br>
Having written all that—I haven’t watched JRE for many moons now. There’s just better stuff on YT—more interesting, more entertaining, more informative. Many podcasters go to UKR-RUS, record, comment, interview etc. Much better to see IRL, even when selective. Whenever X references JRE, it's usually some B-tier cosplayer bores. Don't bother to check. That shi*t-chatting nonsense more entertaining elsewhere.<br>

WFH=Garden office <1min from home bathed in natural sun among greenery, instead of dull office under florescent lights crackling menacingly. <br>
WFH=Personal space replacing open plan office crazy setup, where one wore heavy duty noise cancelling ear muffs to be able to think.<br>
WFH=Can wear trainers or uggs or anything comfortable I fancy. No more wearing gloves with open finger tips for typing in the winter. (the office was freezing.)<br>
Desktop=Not forced to use Windows anymore for 10h a day. Can use Ubuntu or MacOS or whatever I fancy. No need to deal with the local IT admin who answers "Nein" first thinks second b/c "security" always trumps everything, and including whether I can actually do my easier or harder.<br>
Apple Silicon=Macbook screen 10x better than old Lenovo one, battery life 2x better than old Lenovo. (bonus fun: runs local LLM-s and other NN-s with 96 GB (V)RAM)<br>
Car=electric/hybrid wheezing in silence with only the wind swishing as if sailing. No one goes back to ICE, unless they have to.<br>
