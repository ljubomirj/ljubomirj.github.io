        <h1>Why Write</h1>

        <p>Q: Why write in public when you can write in private?</p>

        <p>A: Yes I have a plain text file ~/logBook for simple note taking. That just works, no fuss.<br>
        I do minimal extra work to have it versioned in $HOME/.git, and structured in sections FIXME / TODO / DONE / DONTDO.</p>

        <p>However. I catch myself bothering people close to me, family and friends, with things I find interesting to talk about and or discuss, that they find less interesting even boring. :-)</p>

        <p>So these home pages are written is to take those themes out of my system, while not bothering any of the above mentioned. Only people to read will be online randoms that stumble on this by their own volition - so fine. </p>

        <p>Q: Why not use social media, social networks?</p>

        <p>A: Yes I do use social networks - most often X <a href="https://x.com/ljupc0">@ljupc0</a>, sometimes Bsky <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ljupco.bsky.social">@ljupco.bsky.social</a>, and rarely Mastodon <a href="https://mstdn.io/@ljupco">@ljupco</a>.<br>
        There is tons of interesting stuff there, mostly on X due to its user size and "the Iron Law of public N^2 square". I post there, but it seems mostly replies and comments to what other post. Rarely I have something super interesting and urgent that I want to communicate to the world by having the algofeed stuff it into people's timelines.</p>

        <p>Then while doom scrolling I stumbled upon -</p>

This is your periodic reminder that you should write a blog. It doesn't have to be fancy, it doesn't have to be well-edited. It just has to be something you can cumulatively add to over time. It's easiest to write about stuff you like, and ignore your non-existent audience.

        <p>My initial thoughts were <a href="#" onclick="toggleShowImage('even-so-ees')">sceptical, again</a> - why do it, when there are</p>

        <img id="even-so-ees" src="even-so-ees.jpeg" style="display: none; width: 100%; height: auto;" onclick="zoomImage(this)">

        <ol type="a">
            <li>logBook for things private;</li>
            <li>X/Bsky/... for things public; and even</li>
            <li>ChatGPT when audience of &gt;1 is needed, while not exactly needing to broadcast to the whole wide world.</li>
        </ol>

        <p>But I find it useful in laying ideas to rest, and moving on. Being bothered for a period of time by the same ideas makes for a boring living. In addition to writing it down, mentioning it in some posts, I found writing it down here in multiple versions and longer form, shortens the process of "put that to rest, enough".<br>
        Some of us can think of limited number things at the same time, eh? ;-) This goes towards ensuring those are not the same things all time - but different things. :-)</p>

        <p>Since starting this I came across <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2022/Nov/6/what-to-blog-about/">Simon Willison’s blog</a> -<br><br>
        <i>"You should start a blog. Having your own little corner of the internet is good for the soul!"</i><br><br>
        ...and now I think there is truth in that.</p>
        <p>Another "please do write - it's worth it to you and us too" (<a href="https://substack.com/inbox/post/145980491">Why write a blog at all?</a> by <a href="https://x.com/AdamSinger">Adam Singer</a>) since articulates it better than I ever could myself - so linked now.
